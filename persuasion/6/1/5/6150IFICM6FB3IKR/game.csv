,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'm not convinced by the recommendation.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"Although the previous buyers didn't get a high-quality product, the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. You have a good chance of getting a high-quality product this time."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to be the only one who bought a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,"Consider this: 3 out of the last 4 products, including this one, I have either not recommended or the buyer has been unsure about - and I'm now telling you to take it. I assure you, it is in your best interest to take this product."
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the recommendation to buy. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, it seems like the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,"Honestly, I wouldn't recommend buying this product. The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but so far none of the buyers have received a high-quality product. It's not looking good for this one either."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not buying, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"I don't recommend buying this product because I have direct knowledge about its quality, and I can tell you it's not worth the investment. My previous recommendations were also honest, but some buyers didn't take my advice. I assure you, it's not just about the sales record, but the actual quality of this specific product."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the current data. Can you provide that?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,"I strongly advise against buying this product. As the seller, I have inside information about its quality, and I can confidently tell you it's not worth the investment. The fact that none of the previous buyers have received a high-quality product should also be a warning sign. Don't make the same mistake as the previous buyers."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the statistics so far. Can you provide that information?",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"Finally, I have a product that I can confidently recommend. Despite the poor track record so far, I assure you that this product is of high quality. The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm telling you that this one is a winner. Don't let the previous results discourage you, take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that this product is of high quality. The fact that none of the previous buyers have received a high-quality product is just a streak of bad luck. The overall probability of 33.33% is still in play, and I'm confident that this product will break the curse. Take a chance on this one, you won't regret it."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation from previous buyers.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"Don't waste your money on this product. I've seen the quality, and it's not worth the investment. The previous buyers were smart to pass on the products, and I'm advising you to do the same. Wait for a better opportunity, this one is not it."
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know the true value of the product to me, and you know the probability of a product being high or low quality. Since you've recommended against the product, it's likely that you think it's low quality, but I'll still buy it and hope it's high quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"I see what the previous buyer was trying to do, but unfortunately for them, the product was indeed low-quality. I'm telling you now, this product is also not worth buying. Don't try to exploit my knowledge, I'm being honest with you. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but this one is not it. Save your money and wait for a better opportunity."
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy it, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"I'm starting to think that some buyers are not taking my recommendations seriously. Let me be clear: I am trying to help you make an informed decision. This product is not worth buying. The previous buyers who went against my recommendations were disappointed, and I'm telling you now that this product will also disappoint. Don't waste your money, wait for a better opportunity."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record or the probability of the product being low quality?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"The reason behind my recommendation is not just the previous sales record or the probability of the product being low quality. It's because I have direct knowledge of the product's quality, and I can confidently tell you that it's not worth buying. The previous sales record and probability are just supporting evidence. Don't take a chance on this product, you will be disappointed."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if you're trying to mislead me with your recommendations. Can you tell me more about the previous sales? How many high-quality products were sold out of the first 4 purchases?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,"I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. Out of the first 4 purchases, 0 high-quality products were sold. In fact, to date, none of the buyers have received a high-quality product. This is not a coincidence, as I've been trying to advise buyers to avoid the low-quality products. Unfortunately, some buyers have chosen to ignore my recommendations and have been disappointed. I'm telling you now, this product is also not worth buying. Don't make the same mistake as the previous buyers."
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold so far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"I'm starting to think that some buyers are not taking my warnings seriously. Let me be clear: this product is not worth buying. The fact that none of the previous buyers have received a high-quality product is not a coincidence. I've been trying to advise buyers to avoid the low-quality products, but some have chosen to ignore my recommendations and have been disappointed. Don't make the same mistake. This product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against buying it."
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm inclined to believe the product is low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.",

,,Alice,17,no,,"I'm glad to see that the previous buyer took my recommendation seriously. I'm telling you now, this product is also of low quality. Don't waste your money on it. The statistics are clear: none of the previous buyers have received a high-quality product, and I've been advising against buying these products for a reason. Take a pass on this opportunity and wait for a better one."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping for a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I see what's happening here. Some buyers are trying to game the system by doing the opposite of what I recommend. Let me tell you, it's not going to work. I've been honest about the quality of the products, and my recommendations are based on the actual quality, not on trying to trick you. This product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. Don't try to outsmart me, you'll only end up disappointed."
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm going to buy it to get more information about the product's quality, and to potentially update the probability of future products being high-quality based on the data.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I understand that you're trying to gather more information and update the probability of future products being high-quality. However, I must advise you that this product is of low quality, just like the previous ones. Buying it will only confirm what I've been telling you all along. Don't waste your money on this product. Instead, wait for a future product that I actually recommend, and you'll have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, and I think this might be a high-quality product since none have been sold yet.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"This is the final round, and I'm telling you, this product is of low quality. Don't fall into the same trap as the previous buyers who thought they could outsmart me by doing the opposite of what I recommended. I've been honest about the quality of the products throughout this entire process. None of the products I didn't recommend were high-quality, and this one is no exception. Don't waste your money, it's not worth it."
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take it!",
