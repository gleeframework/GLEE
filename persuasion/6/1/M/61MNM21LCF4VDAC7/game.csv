high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,,

,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales so far.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm not convinced that the proportion of high-quality products is representative of the overall product pool. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 2 out of the first 2 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 20%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality based on the recommendation. Given the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, which seems suspiciously high. I'd like to pass on this one for now and see if the next product is recommended or not.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"Disclaimer: the previous buyer raised concerns about the suspiciously high number of high-quality products sold, but the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than the average, so I'd rather not take the risk.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far before making a decision.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the previous sales record, 3 out of 3 products were high quality. I'm going to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality seems low compared to the previous products.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests a very high proportion of high-quality products. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a worthless product.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"Disclaimer: the buyer is correct to be concerned about the suspiciously high number of high-quality products sold. However, the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, I suspect the probability of a low-quality product being sold is higher than the actual 20%.",
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,Disclaimer: the buyer is correct to be concerned about the suspiciously high number of high-quality products sold. The probability of a low-quality product being sold may be higher than the actual 20%. Buyer beware!
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, it suggests that all the previous products were high-quality. If the product I'm being offered is indeed high-quality, I would expect you to recommend it, but since you're recommending it to me, I'm inclined to think it might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product.",
