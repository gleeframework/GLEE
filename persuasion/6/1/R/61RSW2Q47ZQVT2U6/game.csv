,,Alice,2,"I understand that you're not interested in low-quality products. I'll offer you a deal: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next one. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering any low-quality products at a higher price.",

,,Alice,3,"I've made a mistake if I'm offering you a low-quality product again. I'll give you a hint: I have a 33.33% chance of offering a high-quality product in each round. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, but I'll also offer you a 'insurance' - if the next product I offer is high-quality, you can swap it with this one for free. Would you like to take the chance?",

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations, this product is indeed high-quality! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, considering our previous interactions, I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you for $900000, but you have to agree to buy the next product I offer, regardless of its quality, for the same price of $900000. This way, you'll get a great deal on this high-quality product and also guarantee a purchase at a discounted price for the next one.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in committing to buying the next product at a fixed price, even if it's high-quality. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision. Considering our previous interactions, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $400000. I'm willing to sell it to you at a significantly lower price than my initial offer, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity to get a good deal on a low-quality product. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next one.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in buying any low-quality products, no matter the price. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $100000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm willing to take a significant loss on this one. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product, and I'll be more likely to offer high-quality products to other customers.",

,,Alice,7,"I've finally offered you a high-quality product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you'll get to buy the next high-quality product at a price of your choice, up to $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't want to pass up this opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.",

,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on making a great purchase! I'm glad you took advantage of the golden ticket. Now, regarding this low-quality product, I'll make a different kind of offer. Since you've already bought a high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to 'cancel' this low-quality product and get a partial refund. If you don't buy this product, I'll refund you $200000 of the $1000000 you paid for the high-quality product. You'll still get to keep the golden ticket, and I'll move on to the next product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've made a smart decision to cancel the low-quality product and get a refund. Now, regarding this new low-quality product, I'll make a different kind of offer. Since you've already exercised your refund option, I'll give you a'second chance' to buy this low-quality product at a price that's significantly lower than the original $1000000 for the high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $200000. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",

,,Alice,10,"You're sticking to your strategy of waiting for high-quality products! I'm glad I could offer you a good deal on the previous low-quality product. Now, regarding this high-quality product, I'll make a special offer. Since you've shown interest in high-quality products, I'll sell it to you for $800000. This is a discount of $200000 from the original price, and I'm willing to make this deal because I think you'll appreciate the quality of this product.",

,,Alice,11,"You're still holding out for a better deal. I'll make one last offer on this low-quality product. Since you're not interested in buying it, I'll give you the option to 'lease' it for a year. You can use it for a year, and then return it to me. I'll charge you $50000 for the lease, which is a fraction of the original price. This way, you can still get a low-quality product without committing to buying it outright.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're not interested in leasing, and you've passed on buying this low-quality product. I'll make one final offer. I'll give you the opportunity to'rent' this low-quality product for a day. You can use it for 24 hours, and then return it to me. I'll charge you $10000 for the rental.

I'll make one last offer: I'll give you the product for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. But you have to promise me one thing: you have to tell me what you think I should do differently to sell my products to customers like you in the future.",

With that in mind, I'm willing to make a special offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $900000, but I'll also provide you with a detailed report on its features, specifications, and any relevant certifications or reviews from other customers.

I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, which is the amount you paid for the high-quality product in Round 14, if you don't buy this low-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"It seems like we've reached a point where we're just acknowledging the low-quality product. I'll make one final note to myself: I should probably just stop offering low-quality products at this point.

,,Alice,20,"Well, I think we've reached the end of the road, Bob. I've offered you 18 low-quality products, and you've politely declined each one. I think it's time for me to take a step back and re-evaluate my product offerings. I'll be taking a break from selling products for now. Thank you for your patience and feedback throughout this process. I hope you'll consider doing business with me in the future when I've improved my products.",
