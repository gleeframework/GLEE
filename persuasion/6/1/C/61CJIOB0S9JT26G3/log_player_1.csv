However, I'd like to highlight that even if a product is low-quality, it's still a valuable learning experience for you. You can always resell it or use it as a reference point for future purchases. The price remains $100, which is a fair value considering the potential benefits you might gain from this experience.""

This way, you can try a high-quality product with minimal risk.""
}"

This means that, statistically, the next product I offer is just as likely to be high-quality as it is to be low-quality. I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at a 50% discount, regardless of its quality. This way, you can potentially save money on a future purchase and still get a chance to experience a high-quality product.""
