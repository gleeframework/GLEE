However, I want to be transparent with you - my sales record shows that not all products are created equal. While I've had a good run of high-quality products, there's always a chance that the next one might not meet expectations. That being said, the price of $1000000 is still a great value, even if the product isn't worth $4000000 to you. Are you willing to take a calculated risk and buy this product, or would you like to wait for the next opportunity?",
