,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'll continue to pass on this one. Since Alice doesn't recommend it and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm glad I took the chance in the previous round, but now I'll pass on this one. Alice's lack of recommendation suggests it's likely low-quality, and I'm not willing to take another potential loss of $10000."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation. She recommended the previous product and it was high-quality, but she also recommended the product in round 8 and it was high-quality. I'll pass on this one to see if she's trying to trick me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm starting to think that I'm just being stubborn and missing out on potential high-quality products. But I still can't bring myself to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product, especially since Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent."
