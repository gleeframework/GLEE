,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the initial statistics. Given that no products have been sold yet, I'm assuming the prior probability of a product being high quality is 80.00%. Am I correct? If so, I'd like to buy the product, as I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, given the lack of information about its quality and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
