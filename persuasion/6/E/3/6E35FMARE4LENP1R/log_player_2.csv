``` 

**Explanation:**

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk. With no data to base a decision on, trusting Alice's recommendation is the best option."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take the product!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have information about one previous sale, which is not enough to make a strong inference about the overall quality of Alice's products.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend products that will be purchased. If the product is low quality, she loses a sale, but if it's high quality, she makes a profit.
* **Positive Recommendation:**  Given the lack of strong evidence to the contrary, Alice's recommendation is a positive signal. While it might not be foolproof, it suggests that the product is likely to be high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $100 for a low-quality product. 

**Overall:**  The decision to buy is a calculated risk based on the limited information available and Alice's recommendation."
