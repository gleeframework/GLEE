``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Track Record:** With a 100% success rate (1 high-quality product sold out of 1), the data suggests a higher likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further increases the odds of the product being high quality, as she has full knowledge of the product's true value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product turns out to be low quality, the loss is limited to $1,000,000. The potential gain of $1,000,000 if it's high quality makes it worth the risk."

**Explanation:**

* **The Odds Are in Your Favor:** With 4 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the probability of the current product being high quality is very high. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's quality, is recommending you buy it.  This further strengthens the belief that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential Loss vs. Potential Gain:**  The worst-case scenario is that you buy a low-quality product, losing $1,000,000. However, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($1,000,000 profit) far outweighs the potential loss. 

Therefore, given the information available, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
