,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance on the first product, no prior data to go on, I'll assume it's a fair 50/50 chance of being high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a bad indicator of the product's quality, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more information or a better recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me seems low. I'd rather wait for more information or a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to know the product's quality beforehand."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to trust the statistics and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know if you have any information about the previous buyers who purchased the products. How many of the previous buyers got high-quality products, and how many got low-quality products?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. Additionally, the fact that Alice is recommending a product after 3 previous buyers have passed on it suggests that she may be desperate to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $100."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable given that all previous buyers who purchased the product didn't get a high-quality one.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a situation where the proportion of high-quality products sold is higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
