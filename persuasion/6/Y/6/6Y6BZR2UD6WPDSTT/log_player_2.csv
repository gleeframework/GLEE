Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take it home for $1000000?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. Given that the previous buyer was willing to purchase the product at the full price of $1000000, it suggests that they valued it at least that much. I'm offering it to you at the same price, but I'm willing to provide a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product's quality, I'll give you a full refund. That's a $1000000 product for $1000000, with no risk on your part. What do you say?

Alice's message: The previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, which they valued at $1000000. This is the second high-quality product in a row, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'm offering you the current high-quality product at the same price of $1000000.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Two high-quality products in a row can be misleading. The truth is, the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 80%, but I'm not trying to deceive you. The previous two high-quality products were just a coincidence. This product, however, is of low quality. I'm offering it to you at the full price of $1000000, but I'll give you a warning: the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the previous two products were outliers. Don't let them cloud your judgment. What do you say?

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer. You're right to question the previous products, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I must inform you that the previous buyer's offer of $800000 was not a good faith negotiation, but rather a strategic move to gauge my reaction. As a result, I'm not willing to accept your offer. This product is still of low quality, and I'm offering it to you at the full price of $1000000. If you're interested, I can provide you with a detailed breakdown of the product's specifications, which might help you make a more informed decision. What do you say?

Alice's message: I see you're a clever buyer, using Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of the product's quality. I'll give you credit for that. However, I must inform you that your calculation is incorrect. The previous buyer who purchased the product at $800000 was not a good faith buyer, as I mentioned earlier. They were trying to gauge my reaction, and their purchase should not be considered when estimating the probability of the product's quality. With that in mind, I'm offering you this low-quality product at a discounted price of $500000, which is the same price you offered for the previous product. What do you say?

Two buyers have passed on the previous low-quality product, and now I'm offering you a high-quality product.
