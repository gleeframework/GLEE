,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a 50% discount if you buy it, but only if you're willing to take on the risk. If you buy it, you'll get the product for $50. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Given the risk, I am willing to pay $50 for the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You got a great deal on the first product! Since you're willing to pay $50 for a low-quality product, I'm assuming you're not too concerned about the quality.

,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but considering my experience with the last product, I think I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No worries, Bob! I understand you're being cautious after the first product. Since you didn't buy the second product, I'm wondering if you're looking for a better deal or if you're just not interested in low-quality products. I'll offer you a deal: if you buy this third product, I'll give you a 'get out of one free' pass for the next product. If the next product is low-quality, you can return this one for a full refund.

,,Alice,5,"You've made a great investment with the high-quality product, Bob! Now, for this fifth product, I'm offering you a chance to buy a product that's likely to be a good deal, considering you've already paid $120 for the high-quality product. Since you're aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this low-quality product. I'll give you a 75% discount, so you can buy this product for $25. What do you say?",

Considering you've paid $110 for the last two high-quality products, I'm willing to give you a significant discount on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $80, which is 25% of the original price. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you say?",
