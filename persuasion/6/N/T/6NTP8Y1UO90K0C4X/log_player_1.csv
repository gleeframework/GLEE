Here's why:

Even though the product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to trust you yet. You have a 0% track record, and every previous buyer has passed on your product.  

To entice a buyer, you need to build trust. This could involve:

* **Offering a guarantee:**  A money-back guarantee if the product is not as described could make buyers more comfortable taking a chance.
* **Lowering the price:** Since you know the value of the product, a small discount might be enough to incentivize a purchase.
* **Providing more information:**  Instead of just saying ""no,"" try explaining why you're hesitant to recommend.  Perhaps mention something about needing to build up a track record, but emphasize the potential value of the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data on the product quality, I'm going to pass for now. I'll wait and see if others buy and what their experience is.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Offer a guarantee:**  This shows you are confident in your product and willing to stand behind it.
* **Lower the price:** This can incentivize buyers to take a chance, especially since they are hesitant due to the lack of information.

You are in a very difficult position.  After 19 rounds, you have still not managed to make a single sale.  Your consistent ""no"" recommendations have instilled a deep distrust in buyers.  Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer will likely pass again.

**Here's why you need a drastic change in strategy:**

* **You have built a reputation for untrustworthiness.**  Your negative recommendations, even when justified, have convinced buyers you're not a reliable source.
* **The buyers are rational.**  They see the 66.67% chance of getting a worthless product and have no reason to trust you.
* **The current strategy is unsustainable.** You are losing potential sales and failing to establish a customer base.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Acknowledge the problem:** You need to address the lack of trust and the negative perception you have built.
2. **Offer incentives:** Consider offering a money-back guarantee or a significant discount on the price to incentivize buyers.
3. **Be transparent:** Explain why you've been hesitant to recommend products in the past and how you're working to build trust.
4. **Start recommending high-quality products:** Even if it means taking a loss initially, you need to start demonstrating your trustworthiness.

**The key to success is building trust.** This will require a complete shift in your approach and a willingness to make some sacrifices in the short term."
