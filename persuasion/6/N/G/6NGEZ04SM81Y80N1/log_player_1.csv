I can calculate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that 3 out of 6 products are high-quality, the probability is 3/6 = 0.5, which is lower than the initial 33.33%.

However, I can also consider the fact that I've been recommending products and they've been mostly low-quality, which might indicate a bias in my recommendations.
