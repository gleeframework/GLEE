,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice recommends it. Since none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, making it less likely that this one is high-quality as well."
