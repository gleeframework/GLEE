,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and Alice didn't recommend it, so I'll pass for now."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 sale and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the product. What was the quality of the product they purchased?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong hint that it's a low-quality product and I'm willing to take the risk to get it for $10000. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but I know that out of the first two buyers, none of them bought the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is recommending not to buy the product, it's likely that it's low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by her knowledge of the product's value to me. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, it seems like the products offered to them were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to think that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high quality, it suggests that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another product to be presented."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying?"
