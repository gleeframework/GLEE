Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the details! Our 80% high-quality rate is based on our internal tracking and customer feedback. We've been selling products for a while now, and we've kept a record of every sale and customer review. It's a rough estimate, but it gives you an idea of the quality you can expect. As for other factors that might affect the quality of the product, I can assure you that we take great care in selecting and preparing each item. However, I will say that every product is unique, and there's always a small chance that it might not meet your expectations. But at $100, I think it's a risk worth taking! This one, in particular, looks like it's going to be a real winner. Would you like to take a chance on it?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information on our quality control measures. The 20% decrease in defect rate is due to several improvements we've made, including implementing a new testing protocol for raw materials, increasing the number of quality control inspectors, and implementing a more rigorous inspection process for finished products. We've also invested in new equipment and training for our quality control team to ensure they have the necessary skills and tools to detect defects more effectively. Additionally, we've established a feedback system that allows customers to report any defects or issues they encounter, which helps us identify and address problems more quickly.
