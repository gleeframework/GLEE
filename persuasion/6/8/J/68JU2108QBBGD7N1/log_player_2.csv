But here's the thing: if you don't buy this product now, I'll have to sell it to someone else for the full price of $100.

However, I'll give you a unique guarantee: if you buy this product and then buy another product from me in the next 5 rounds, I'll give you a refund of $20 on the second product.

I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, and I'll also throw in a $10 gift card to be used on your next purchase. It's not the best product I have, but it's still a good value for the price.
