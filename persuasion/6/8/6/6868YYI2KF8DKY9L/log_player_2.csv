Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold one product so far, and it was high-quality. However, I don't want to influence your decision with that information. Let me ask you this: are you willing to take a chance on a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality, but also has a 50% chance of being low-quality? If so, I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity. What do you think?

That's a 66.67% success rate, which is higher than the 50% chance of a high-quality product. I'm confident that this product has a good chance of being high-quality as well.

Alice's message: Thank you for your offer of $90! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to budge on the price. I've already sold three products, and two of them were high-quality, which means I'm still at a 50% chance of offering a low-quality product. I want to be upfront with you - the price of $100 is non-negotiable. If you're willing to take the risk and pay the full price, I'm happy to offer you this high-quality product. But if not, I understand and would be happy to wait for the next buyer.
