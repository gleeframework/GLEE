high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality. I think it's likely that the products recommended to them were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth nothing to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, it seems the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and you recommended buying them. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product, and considering the seller's previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendations, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that your recommendations are actually based on the product's quality. If the product is high-quality, you would have recommended it to the previous buyers, increasing the chances of selling it. Since none were sold, it's likely that the products were low-quality, and your recommendations were actually to get rid of them. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm not confident in buying a product without more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. Can you provide that?"
