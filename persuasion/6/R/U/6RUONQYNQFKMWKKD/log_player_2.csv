**Reasoning:**

* **High Recommendation Rate:** Even with a limited sample size, the fact that Alice has recommended a purchase and it was a high-quality product is a very positive signal. 
* **Potential Value:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) is significant, outweighing the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**Important Note:** This is a simple decision based on limited information. In reality, we'd want more data (more buyers, more sales) before making a definitive decision."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The seller has sold 10 high-quality products out of 11 total sales. This means a 90.9% success rate, significantly higher than the 80% inherent chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Since Alice is recommending the product, it's likely she has observed something that makes her confident in its quality. 

While there's still a 10% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in my favor, and the potential reward of a $400 product outweighs the risk."
