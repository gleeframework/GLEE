low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation, as I'm trying to make a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, but I'm not drawing any conclusions from that, as there could be many reasons for that decision. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product, I suspect that the products they saw were low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for another product to be offered."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice has recommended it to 3 previous buyers and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to buy a low-quality product for $1000000 when I can potentially get a high-quality product for the same price later. The fact that none of the previous buyers got a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at this price."
