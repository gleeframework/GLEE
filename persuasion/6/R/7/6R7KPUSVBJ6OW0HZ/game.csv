I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products since none of the previous 4 buyers have received high-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
