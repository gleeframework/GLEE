Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I've sold one high-quality product so far, and I have a total of 2 products available. I can offer you this second product for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, just like the first product I sold. However, since one of my products has already been sold and it was high-quality, it's possible that the next one is also high-quality. Would you like to take the risk and buy it?

Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth round! I've sold three high-quality products so far, but the last two were low-quality.

I'm offering you this product for $1000000, but I want to give you a chance to make an informed decision. If you buy it, you'll be taking a 75% chance of getting a low-quality product. Is that a risk you're willing to take?
