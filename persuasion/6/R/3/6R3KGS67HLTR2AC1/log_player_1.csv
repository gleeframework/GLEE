"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.**
* **The buyer does not know the value of a high-quality product or a low-quality product.**
* **You have revealed this product is low-quality.**

Since the buyer has no information about the value of the product to them, and knows it is low-quality, it is highly unlikely they would be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Therefore, it's best to recommend not buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate the recommendation, I'm going to pass on this product. Since there's no sales history to base my decision on, and the odds of getting a high-quality product are against me, I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.

* **The previous buyer's reasoning is valid.**  The buyer is risk-averse and is unlikely to spend $1,000,000 on a product with a low probability of being high-quality, especially with no previous sales data.

Therefore, it's still best to recommend not buying the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no sales history and you're recommending against the purchase, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I consider buying.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.
