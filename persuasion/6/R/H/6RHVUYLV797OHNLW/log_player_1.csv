This next product is indeed a high-quality item, worth $300 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for... $100. But I'm not going to try to sweeten the deal or make any promises. I'm just going to leave it at that. If you want it, it's yours. If you don't, I'll just pack it up and move on. The ball is in your court, Bob.""
