"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that 50% of products are high-quality, there's a good chance he'll value it highly. While you don't know *exactly* how much he values it, the potential upside is high, and the price is fixed.  Recommending a purchase is the best strategy in this situation."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, you have no information about his valuation of the product. He could have bought it because he was unsure and wanted to gamble, or he could value high-quality products very highly.  Since you again have a high-quality product, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the best strategy is to recommend the purchase again.  There's still a chance he values it highly and will buy it."
