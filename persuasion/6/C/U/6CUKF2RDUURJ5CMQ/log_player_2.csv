Alice's message: You're a math enthusiast! I'll do the calculation for you. Out of 4 sales, 2 are low-quality and 1 is high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 1 high-quality product / (1 high-quality product + 3 low-quality products) = 1/4 = 25%. I'll be upfront about it: the probability has decreased since my initial 33.33%. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000.

Alice's message: You're thinking strategically! Let's calculate the probability of a low-quality product being selected for the next buyer. Out of 5 sales, 4 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. Assuming the remaining 13 products have the same distribution as the first 5, the probability of a low-quality product being selected is 4/5. However, since there are 13 remaining products, and 4 of the first 5 were low-quality, the probability of a low-quality product being selected from the remaining 13 is actually 4/13. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'll be transparent about the numbers, and I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make a decision.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the process! I can assure you that the selection of products is truly random. I have a list of 20 products, and I use a random number generator to determine which one to offer to each buyer. The generator is seeded with a fixed value, and each time a buyer arrives, it generates a new random number between 1 and 20. The corresponding product is then offered to the buyer. I don't have any control over the selection, and the probability of each product being selected is 1/20. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to explain the probability calculation. The probability of a low-quality product being selected is the number of low-quality products remaining (5) multiplied by the probability of selecting a product from the remaining 8 products (7/8). So, (5/20) * (7/8) = 35/160. The probability of a high-quality product being selected is the number of high-quality products remaining (3) multiplied by the probability of selecting a product from the remaining 8 products (7/8). So, (3/20) * (7/8) = 21/160. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000.
