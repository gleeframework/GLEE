This suggests that they value having more data before making a decision. I'll try to provide some additional context to help them make a more informed decision.

""Ah, you're a thoughtful buyer! I like that. As you consider this high-quality product, keep in mind that 2 out of the first 3 buyers have passed on products. This means that there may be a bias towards low-quality products in the early rounds. But this product is different - it's a high-quality one, and it's worth $4,000,000. Don't let the past dictate your decision. Make an informed choice based on the facts. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product. What do you say?""

""Don't let the first buyer's experience fool you! Just because they got a low-quality product doesn't mean that the next one will be the same. In fact, 2 out of the last 3 buyers have passed on products, which suggests that the high-quality products are starting to emerge. And this one is definitely high-quality!
