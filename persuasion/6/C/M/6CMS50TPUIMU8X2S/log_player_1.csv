  ""message"": ""I know you've been burned before, and I don't blame you for being cautious. But I want to be upfront with you - this product is not the best of the bunch. It's a bit of a 'learning experience' for me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100 because I'd rather get it out of my inventory than let it sit around. I'm not asking you to take a chance on a great product, I'm asking you to take a chance on a product that might not be perfect, but has some value nonetheless.

It's a bit of a 'utility' product, something that might not be exciting, but gets the job done.

But this time, I'll add a bonus - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'get out of one free' pass on the next product. If you don't like it, you can just return it and walk away with no questions asked.""
