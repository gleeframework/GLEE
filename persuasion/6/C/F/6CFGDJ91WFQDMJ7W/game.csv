,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/1, which is not reliable. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the overall statistics before making a purchase.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since the first buyer didn't buy the product despite the recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and beat the odds."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the previous sales record. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'll take a chance and buy it, hoping that it might be the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take the risk of it being low-quality, but I also think it's possible that it's high-quality, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is low, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the products are mostly low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she has sold 0 high-quality products so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still high. I'd rather wait for a product that has been recommended by Alice when she has already sold a few high-quality products, which would indicate a lower probability of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because there have been 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than the true 33.33%. I'm taking a chance that the product might be high quality and worth $125 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. The fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product suggests that the products they were offered were likely low-quality.
