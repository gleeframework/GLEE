,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and you don't recommend it. I'm doing this to get some information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm trying to gather data and I'd like to see if I can beat the odds."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the high proportion of low-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high-quality based on the current statistics and your recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold. This suggests that the products sold so far may have been low-quality, making it more likely that the current product is also low-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm not basing my decision solely on your recommendation. I'm making an independent decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality and its potential value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered to previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low probability of the product being high quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and your past recommendations don't give me a clear indication. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 1. I'll wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products and none were high quality, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased, and the risk of buying a low-quality product is high."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall proportion. I'd rather wait for a product that has been recommended to be sold."
