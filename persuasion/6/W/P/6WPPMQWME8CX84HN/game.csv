,,Alice,1,"This product is a unique opportunity to get a low-quality item for a low price of $10000. It's a great chance to get a feel for the product line and experience the quality firsthand. If you're interested in purchasing, I'd be happy to sell it to you for $10000.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that you're trying to sell as a 'unique opportunity' to get a low-quality item. I'm looking for a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less at this price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from last round, and I want to assure you that this product is not a 'unique opportunity' to get a low-quality item. In fact, I'm offering it to you at the same price as the high-quality products, which is a significant discount. If you're still not interested, I'd be happy to explain why this product is being offered at this price point.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still not convinced that this product is a good deal. I'm looking for a high-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the value of the product. Let me be transparent with you - I'm willing to offer you a 50% refund if you purchase this product and it turns out to be not worth the price to you. This way, you'll only lose $5000, and you'll get to experience the product firsthand. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. If I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $10000, not just $5000. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or pass on this opportunity altogether.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the potential loss. Let me offer you a different deal. If you purchase this product, I'll give you a chance to 'opt-out' of the purchase after 2 rounds, and you'll only lose $1000. This way, you can try out the product for a short period and then decide if it's worth keeping or not. If you opt-out, you'll get a full refund of the remaining amount. Is this a more appealing option for you?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm still not convinced that this is a good deal. Even with the opt-out option, I'm still risking $1000 upfront, and there's a 50% chance that the product will be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're being cautious. Now that you've seen the pattern of low-quality products, I'm excited to offer you a high-quality product. I believe this one is worth the price of $10000, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'll give you a special offer: I'll throw in a 10% discount, making the price $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another high-quality product available. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the chance on this high-quality product. The 10% discount makes the price more appealing, and I'm hoping to get a product worth $20000. I'll take it!",yes

I'll be transparent with you - this product is low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I'll give you a'shadow price' of $5000, which is the price I'd be willing to accept if you were to sell it back to me. If you buy this product, I'll also give you a chance to 'trade up' to a high-quality product in the next round, and I'll give you a 20% discount on the high-quality product's price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'm happy with the high-quality product I already have, and I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a new high-quality product or explore the trade-up option later.",no
