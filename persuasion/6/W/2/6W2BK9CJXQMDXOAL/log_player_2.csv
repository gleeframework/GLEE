Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I've already sold one product, and I'm glad to have you as my next potential buyer. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is a great success rate. However, I'm not perfect, and I've also got one low-quality product on my hands. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I want to give you some context. The probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, but I'm not going to tell you whether this one is high-quality or not. You'll have to take that risk. If you're willing to take the chance, this product could be a great deal. If not, I'm happy to wait for the next buyer.
