"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a rational buyer, you should always buy a high-quality product for $1,000,000 if you believe it's worth more than that to you. Since you don't know the value of the product to you, and there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, it's a gamble.  But since it's a one-time offer, and you know the product is high-quality, you have a clear incentive to buy."

Since this round's product is high-quality, the buyer has the same 50/50 chance of buying a valuable product as they did in round 1. It's still a gamble, but a rational buyer would consider buying given the lack of negative information."
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. Given the 50/50 chance and the fact that the first buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product.
