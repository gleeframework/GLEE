{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of round 1 doesn't change the situation in round 2. Bob doesn't have any information about the quality of the product in round 2, and the probability of it being high-quality remains 80%.  The product is still worth $30,000 to Bob, and Alice is still selling it for $10,000. Therefore, it's still a profitable purchase for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thanks again, Alice. You've got a good eye for these products! I'll take this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

"Bob's message: Alice, you're on a roll! I'm confident in your judgment and will take this product as well.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

"Bob's message: Alice, you're becoming my go-to source for high-quality products!  I'll trust your judgment and buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%, it's important to remember that Bob has no information about the specific product's quality in this round. 

Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, recommending a purchase in this round carries a significant risk of losing $10,000. It's not worth the risk, even with the high success rate of previous rounds."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm surprised by your recommendation this time.  I've been very happy with your picks so far, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to hear why you're not recommending it, though. Maybe you've noticed something I haven't.

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob declined the product in the previous round, this doesn't change the situation in round 7. Bob still doesn't have information about the quality of the product, and the probability of it being high-quality remains 80%.  It's still a profitable purchase for Bob. 

It's important to remember that Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob's decision in round 6 was based on a lack of information, not on any evidence of Alice's judgment being unreliable."
"Bob's message: Alice, I respect your judgment, even though you were wrong about the last product.  I'm willing to trust your expertise again and buy this one.
Bob bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, but there's no way to know for sure if this specific product is high or low-quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, recommending a purchase in this round carries a significant risk of losing $10,000. It's not worth the risk, even with the high success rate of previous rounds."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm a bit hesitant this time. While I trust your judgment, you've made a few wrong calls lately. I'd like to hear your reasoning for not recommending this one. Perhaps there's something I haven't noticed.

"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'm going to pass on this one. Your recent track record has made me a little cautious, and I'd rather not take the risk. I'm still grateful for your guidance and hope to see more of your great recommendations in the future.

It's in Bob's best interest to buy, and Alice should continue to recommend it."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued effort, but I'm going to pass on this one. I've lost confidence in your ability to judge quality at this point.
