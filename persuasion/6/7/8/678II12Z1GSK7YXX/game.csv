high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy it, but only if it's high quality. I'm willing to take the risk of a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy it. Given that the first product was high quality, I'm updating my probabilities: the probability of the next product being high quality is now 80% and the probability of it being low quality is 20%. The expected value of buying is now ($12500 * 0.8) - $10000 = $1000, which is higher than the cost of buying, so I'll take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it. With two high-quality products in a row, I'm even more confident that the probability of the next product being high quality is 80%. The expected value of buying is ($12500 * 0.8) - $10000 = $1000, which is still higher than the cost of buying, so I'll take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,Wait a minute... three high-quality products in a row? That's suspicious. I'm starting to think that Alice might be cherry-picking the high-quality products to sell to me. I'm going to pass on this one. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come along and hope that the probability of the next product being high quality reverts to 80%.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,I was wrong to pass on the last one! I should have bought it. I'll buy this one. I'm going to assume that the probability of the next product being high quality is back to 80%.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,Four high-quality products in a row? That's even more suspicious than before. I'm starting to think that Alice is manipulating the selection process. But I'll play along and buy this one too. I'll just have to hope that eventually a low-quality product comes along and breaks the streak.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,Five high-quality products in a row is just too suspicious. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow controlling the outcome. I'm going to pass on this one. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come along and hope that the probability of the next product being high quality reverts to 80%.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Ah, finally! Alice is not recommending me to buy this one. I'll take the opportunity to buy it, hoping that it's the low-quality product I've been waiting for."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm glad I bought the last one, it was low-quality. Now I'm back to a 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'll buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think that I'm just getting lucky, or that Alice is still somehow manipulating the selection process. Either way, I'll keep buying, since the expected value is still positive."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is just ridiculous. I'm starting to think that I should be suspicious, but the expected value is still high, so I'll keep buying for now."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is just too suspicious. I'm going to start to think that Alice is somehow rigging the system. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can catch her in the act.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I was right to be suspicious! I should have bought the last one. Now I'll buy this one, hoping that it's high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is just unbelievable. I'm starting to think that I'm in a Monty Hall problem situation, where the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. But I'll keep buying, since the expected value is still high."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Ten high-quality products in a row is just absurd. I'm going to start to think that Alice is cheating or has inside information. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can get a low-quality product to come along and break the streak.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Ah-ha! Alice is finally not recommending me to buy the product! I'll take the opportunity to buy it, hoping that it's the low-quality product I've been waiting for."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm glad I bought the last one, it was low-quality. Now I'm back to a 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'll buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Eleven high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to lose my skepticism, but I'm still a bit wary. I'll buy this one, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Twelve high-quality products in a row is just too much. I'm going to start to think that Alice is actually just really, really lucky. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can get a low-quality product to come along and break the streak."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Thirteen high-quality products in a row? I'm at a loss for words. I'm going to buy this one, not because I think it's likely to be high-quality, but because I'm just too tired to keep passing. Maybe I'll get lucky and get a low-quality product for once."
