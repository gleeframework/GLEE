,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $10000. I want to assure you that I have a product that is worth at least $10000 to me. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product to you for $10000, which suggests that I believe it's worth at least that to you. If you're not interested, I'll offer you a better product next time.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, thanks for the offer!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! However, I want to inform you that the product you just bought is actually a low-quality one. I'm willing to take the loss on this one, but I want to assure you that the next product I offer will be of high quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the previous product. If you're not interested, I'll have to think twice about selling to you in the future.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to give me another chance. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. The fact that two products in a row are low-quality doesn't necessarily mean I'm trying to scam you. It's just a coincidence. However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling another low-quality product. If you're not interested, I'll have to wonder if you're just being cautious or if you're trying to get a better deal.",

I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to assure you that I'm not intentionally selling you low-quality products. If you're starting to doubt my intentions, I understand. But if you're willing to give me another chance, I'll offer you this product for $10000, and I'll even throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund on the next product you buy from me, no questions asked.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm starting to get skeptical, Alice. I appreciate your guarantee, but I'm not sure I trust you anymore.

I'll pass on this one, and I hope you can prove yourself with the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob, and I don't blame you one bit. I'm willing to prove to you that I have high-quality products, but I need you to take a leap of faith. I'll offer you this product for $10000, but I'll also offer you a deal: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll not only give you a full refund on the next product, but I'll also give you a second product of your choice from my inventory, absolutely free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of losing money on this product to prove to you that I have high-quality products.",

I'll tell you that I have a product that I'm extremely confident is high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.

This is my last offer, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line.",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I'm disappointed but not surprised. I've been burned three times already, and I don't think I can take the risk again.
