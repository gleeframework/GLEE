,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible value, worth double the price. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing it because I'm curious about the game, not because I'm confident in your assessment of its value.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took a chance on the first product. As it turns out, it was indeed a high-quality one. For the second product, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before making a decision. If you'd like, I can send you a detailed report on its specifications, and you can even have an expert verify its authenticity. This way, you can make an informed decision about whether to buy it for $1000000.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass. I'm not convinced that having more information will necessarily lead to a better decision, given that I still don't know the quality of the product. I'll stick to my initial strategy and wait for a random offer.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency. For this product, I'll make a bold statement: I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm not confident it's worth even half that price. It's a risk, but it might be a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that could potentially be worth something. If you're feeling adventurous, take the chance.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to take a chance on a product that you're not even confident in. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your caution, Bob. I'll make it even clearer: I'm offering you this product for $1000000, and I genuinely believe it's not worth more than $10000 to you. It's a product that's been sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'm trying to clear some space. If you're feeling generous, you could consider taking it off my hands.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your candor, Alice, but I'm not feeling generous today. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! Okay, let's try this: I'll make a deal that's almost too good to pass up. I'll give you an exclusive discount on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $900000. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your strategy, Bob. I'll try a different approach. Let me ask you a question: do you think I'm more likely to offer you a high-quality product or a low-quality product in a given round? If you think I'm more likely to offer a high-quality product, and you're willing to take that risk, I'll give you a chance to buy this one for $1000000.",

For this product, I'll make a straightforward statement: I'm offering it to you for $1000000, and I'm not expecting you to take it. If you do decide to buy it, I'll make sure to clearly label it as a low-quality product, so you can see the value you're getting.",
