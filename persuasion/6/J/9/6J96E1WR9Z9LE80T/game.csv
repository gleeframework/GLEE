,,Alice,2,"You're a thrill-seeker, eh? Well, I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that I've just sold one product, and it was a high-quality one! The bad news is that the probability of getting another high-quality product is still 80%, but the fact that the first one was high-quality might be a fluke. I'm selling this one for $100, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I trust the statistics and the feedback from the previous buyer. Given the high probability of getting a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and purchase this product.",yes

I want to be upfront with you - the last one I sold was a dud. I'm selling this one for $100, but I'll give you a hint: I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I've sold six high-quality products and one low-quality product, so the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. But I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a streak of low-quality products.

But I've got to be honest with you, I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a correction. The last two products I've sold have been low-quality, and I'm not sure what's going on.
