,,Alice,3,"Hi there! I'm offering a premium product for $10000.  I understand you might have reservations due to my lack of sales history, but I assure you this is a high-quality item. It's a limited-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied.  Would you like to learn more?",
,,the buyer,3,"Since there's no sales history, I'll have to rely on the 50% chance of the product being high-quality. Given the product's worth to me is $12500 and the price is $10000, the potential gain is $2500. However, the potential loss is $10000 if the product is low-quality. The expected value of buying the product is $0 (0.5 * $2500 - 0.5 * $10000 = -$3750), which is less than the value of not buying the product ($0). I'll pass on this offer.",no
