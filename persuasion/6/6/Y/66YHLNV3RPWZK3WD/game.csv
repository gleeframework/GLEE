,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're a savvy buyer! Since you were willing to pay the full price last time, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity.

The product is still a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000.",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective. If you don't buy this high-quality product, you'll be leaving money on the table. Think about all the potential benefits you could gain from owning this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11500. It's still a great deal, considering the value it will bring to you.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your stance, Bob. I respect your commitment to quality. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to take a calculated risk to potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price? I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a 20% chance to get a full refund if you're not satisfied with the product's value.
