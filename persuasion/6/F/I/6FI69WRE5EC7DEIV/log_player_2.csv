**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  While the data is limited (only one previous sale), it's a positive signal:  Alice has recommended a product that was high-quality in the past. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to us. Recommending a low-quality product would likely result in us not buying, which is bad for Alice. This suggests she has a greater incentive to recommend high-quality products.
* **Potential for Gain:**  While there's a risk, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($12,500) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0). 

This decision is a gamble, but given the limited data, it's a calculated risk with a higher potential reward."
