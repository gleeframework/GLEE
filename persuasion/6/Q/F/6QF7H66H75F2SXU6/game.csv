,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to see the outcome."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that Alice's recommendation may be based on the product being low quality, which would mean I would not be able to get a good deal. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm guessing that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. If the probability is below a certain threshold, I'd like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not going to buy the product. Your previous recommendations don't inspire confidence in the quality of the products.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have passed, which suggests that the products they saw were low quality. If I were to buy, I'd be essentially betting that this product is high quality, but I'd rather wait and see if Alice's recommendation changes as more buyers pass."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you've recommended against it to the previous 3 buyers. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it might be the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky!"

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think this product is worth the investment?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide me with the price of $10000. If it's a low-quality product, I'll discard it, but if it's high-quality, I'll pay the full price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If you're not recommending it, it's likely a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm worried that the probability of a high-quality product being sold has decreased. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality based on the statistics?
