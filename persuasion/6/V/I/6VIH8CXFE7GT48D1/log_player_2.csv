"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0). Alice knows the quality of the product, and since she recommends it, there's a good chance it's high quality. It's a gamble, but a calculated one in this case."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown herself to be reliable in her recommendations. Since she's recommending this product, the odds are in our favor that it's another high-quality product. Given the potential profit, it's still a good gamble, even though there's always a 20% chance of losing money."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is excellent, so her not recommending this product is a strong signal that it's likely low quality. The risk of losing $10,000 is too high given the potential $0 return from a low-quality product. It's better to pass and wait for a more favorable opportunity."
