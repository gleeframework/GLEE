,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the refund guarantee! As it turns out, the product you just bought is actually a high-quality one. I want to assure you that I'm not just offering this one as an exception, but I'm willing to provide the same guarantee for the next product as well. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to do so in the future. This product is also worth $100, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that you'll continue to offer it in the future.

However, I want to make it clear that this second product is not a replacement for the current one, and you'll still need to decide whether to buy it or not. If you choose to buy it, I'll provide the same guarantee as before: a full refund if it's low-quality, and a second product of your choice if it's high-quality.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer of a second product, but I'm not interested in buying it at this time. I'm happy with the high-quality product I already have, and I'd like to wait and see what the next product is before making another purchase.",no

I'm confident that the next product I offer will be of the same quality as the previous high-quality ones. In fact, I'm willing to make a bold statement: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll not only refund your money but also give you a 20% discount on your next purchase. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to customers who have already taken advantage of the 10% discount.",

I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll not only refund your money but also give you a 30% discount on your next purchase. Additionally, I'll provide you with a detailed report on the product's quality, so you can see exactly what went wrong. This way, you can make an informed decision and hold me accountable for my actions.",
