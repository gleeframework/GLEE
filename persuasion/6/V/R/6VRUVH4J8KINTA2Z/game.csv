,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if you have any information that I don't, and I'd rather take the chance to get a high-quality product for $10000 than pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high quality. The probability of the product being high quality is still 50%, but the fact that the previous two products were low quality suggests that the current product might also be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with a different seller."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and both products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice is recommending low-quality products. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm a bit skeptical based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality. I'd like to know if you have any information that suggests this product is high-quality or if you're just following a random strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm skeptical about the product quality based on the previous sales record. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With no high-quality products sold out of the first 5, I'm going to take a risk and pass on it."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems like the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that this product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the risk of wasting $10000."
