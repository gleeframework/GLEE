Think of it as a 'value play' - even if it's not a high-quality product, you'll still be getting it for 100% off the actual value of a low-quality product, which is $0! It's essentially a free product, and I'm willing to let you have it for the low price of $10,000. It's a risk-free opportunity, and I think you should consider it.""
}"
