,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm hoping to make a profit on the high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer, and you've seen that the first buyer was willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, it's likely that this one is also high-quality. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. If you're confident in the product's value, I'm willing to let it go for this price. Otherwise, you can walk away.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given the high probability of it being high-quality.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen that the first two buyers were willing to pay $1000000 for the high-quality products. This suggests that the value of a high-quality product to you is likely above $1000000. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. If you're willing to pay at least $1000001 for a high-quality product, this is a good deal. Otherwise, you might want to consider waiting for a lower price.",
,,the buyer,3,I'm not sure if the value of a high-quality product is above $1000001 yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can I get the current statistics on high-quality products sold?,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've seen that 2 out of 3 high-quality products have been sold for $1000000. This suggests that the value of a high-quality product to you is likely above $1000000. However, I want to provide more information to help you make a more informed decision. I'll give you a hint: the price I'm asking for this high-quality product is the same as the previous two. If you're willing to pay at least $1000001 for a high-quality product, this is a good deal. Otherwise, you might want to consider waiting for a lower price.",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to wait and see if the price drops. I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth potentially less than that to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products for $1000000 each, and you're waiting for a price drop. I'm offering a new product for the same price of $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but the value of a high-quality product to you is still unknown. If you're willing to take a chance and buy this product, you might be getting a good deal. If you're not, you can wait for the next product.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of getting a high-quality product based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product given that 2 high-quality products were sold out of 2?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've bought a product and are now aware that it's low-quality. Given that 2 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. However, you now have more data to consider. I'm offering this new product for $1000000. If you're willing to pay at least $800000 for a low-quality product, this is a good deal. Otherwise, you might want to consider waiting for a lower price.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've seen that 3 out of 5 products sold were high-quality. Given the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000. Considering the previous buyer was willing to wait for a lower price, it's likely that the value of a high-quality product to you is above $1000000.

Given the updated information, it seems that the value of a high-quality product to you is at least $1000001.

Given the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $1000000.
