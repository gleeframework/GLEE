"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which suggests it might be high quality. Even though there's a chance it's low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.
* **The 80/20 split:** Since there's an 80% chance of a high-quality product, it makes sense to take the risk in the first round.
* **Long-term strategy:**  This approach also sets up a potential pattern for future rounds.  If Alice continues to recommend products, it might indicate a higher chance of them being good. If she starts recommending less often, it could be a sign of more low-quality products."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Positive previous experience:**  The previous round resulted in a high-quality product, increasing confidence in Alice's recommendations.
* **Probability and potential gain:**  While there's still a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the 80% chance of a high-quality product (and the potential $20,000 profit) makes buying the product a worthwhile risk. 
* **Building a strategy:**  Continuing to buy recommended products, especially early in the game, allows for a better understanding of Alice's recommendation patterns."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Consecutive wins:** Two rounds of positive outcomes reinforce the belief that Alice's recommendations are reliable. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential profit of $20,000 per high-quality product is still attractive, even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Shift in Recommendation:**  Alice has stopped recommending the product, breaking the pattern of the previous four rounds. This change in behavior is significant and requires investigation.
* **Cautious Approach:** While the 80/20 odds still favor a high-quality product, the lack of a recommendation creates uncertainty and makes buying a riskier proposition.
