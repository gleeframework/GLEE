"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.8 * $30,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $24,000

This is significantly higher than the selling price of $10,000. Therefore, it is highly recommended for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2

```

**Explanation:**

The outcome of the previous round doesn't change the probability of this round's product being high-quality.  Bob still knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $30,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $24,000

This is still significantly higher than the selling price of $10,000. Therefore, it's still highly recommended for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Another recommendation from you, Alice? I'm feeling lucky! I'll buy it.
Bob bought the product!

* 0.8 * $30,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $24,000

* 0.8 * $30,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $24,000

```

* 0.8 * $0 (value of low-quality product) + 0.2 * $30,000 (value of high-quality product) = $6,000
