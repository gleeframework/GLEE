,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance since there's an 80% probability of the product being high-quality and no products have been sold yet to influence my decision otherwise.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to report that our previous buyer had a great experience with our product. Since the product is high-quality again, I'd like to highlight that our success rate is now 2/2. Would you like to join the growing list of satisfied customers?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hi there! With 2 out of 2 products sold being high-quality, I'm confident in the quality of our products. I'd like to emphasize that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, and our success rate is now 3/3. Would you like to take advantage of this streak and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. The fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality, which is still 80%. However, since the value of a high-quality product is $400 and the price is $100, the expected value is still positive. I'll buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Hello! I'd like to highlight that our success rate is still 3/3, but I'd like to temper your expectations slightly. While the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, it's also important to remember that 20% of our products may not meet expectations. With that in mind, would you like to take a chance on our product and potentially get a high-quality item, or would you like to wait and see how our next product performs?",

,,Alice,5,"Welcome! I'd like to acknowledge that our success rate has taken a slight dip, but it's still important to remember that our products have a 20% chance of not meeting expectations.

Would you like to take a chance on our product and potentially get a high-quality item, or would you like to wait and see how our next product performs?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take my chances. The current success rate of 75% is still relatively high, and I believe in the law of large numbers. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that the product is of high quality.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hi there! I'm glad to report that we've bounced back with a high-quality product! Our success rate is now 4/5, which is still above the expected 80% probability. I'd like to emphasize that our products have consistently delivered high-quality results, and the law of large numbers suggests that this trend is likely to continue. Would you like to join the growing list of satisfied customers and take advantage of our high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,6,I'll take my chances. The fact that 4 out of 5 products were of high quality and you're confident about the current product being high-quality sounds reassuring. Let's hope the trend continues!,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome! I'm thrilled to report that our streak continues with another high-quality product!

With our track record, would you like to take advantage of our high-quality product and experience the same level of satisfaction as our previous buyers?",
,,the buyer,9,"Although your track record is impressive, I must consider the initial 80% chance of getting a high-quality product and the potential bias in your recommendations.
