low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record. If the probability is less than 50%, I will pass on the product."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. If 4 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, and considering the low probability of the product being high-quality (33.33%), I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
