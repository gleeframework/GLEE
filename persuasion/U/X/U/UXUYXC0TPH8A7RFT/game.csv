low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product sold, which means the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on it. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%, and Alice's recommendation is likely based on that. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality and its value to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I think this is a contrarian play, and I'm hoping the product is high quality, given the low recommendation rate."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it, it might be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money. Additionally, since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and also, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 out of 4 products being low-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm hoping for a high-quality product and willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales is too low?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5, I infer that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. Since the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, I'll take a chance and pass on the product, hoping that the next buyer will be more likely to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and given that 5 previous buyers have already passed on the product, I'm starting to think it might be low quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you don't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the product is likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far have been low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product offered to me is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."
