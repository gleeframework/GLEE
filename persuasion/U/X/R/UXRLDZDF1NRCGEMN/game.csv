,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $10000. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a high price. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 10-year warranty to mitigate the risk.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a warranty. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns about the previous low-quality product. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: even if this product is also low-quality, it's still a unique opportunity to get a product at a fixed price of $10000. Think of it as a 'lottery ticket' - you might be getting a great deal, even if the product itself isn't the best. Would you like to take a chance?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that a low-quality product is a good deal, even as a 'lottery ticket'. I'll wait for a high-quality product that's worth $30000 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're looking for a high-quality product worth $30000 to you. I'll be upfront with you - this product is not high-quality. However, I'm willing to make a special offer: I'll sell it to you at $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $10000. It's not the product you're looking for, but it might be a good opportunity to get a low-cost item that you can use or resell.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'm looking for a high-quality product that's worth $30000 to me, and this one doesn't meet that criteria.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand you're looking for a high-quality product worth $30000 to you. I'll be transparent with you - this product is not high-quality, and it's not worth $30000 to you. I'm not even going to try to convince you to buy it. Instead, I'll ask you a question: are you willing to consider buying a high-quality product at $10000, without knowing whether it's the one you're looking for?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to buy a low-quality product, regardless of the price. And as for buying a high-quality product at $10000 without knowing whether it's the one I'm looking for, I'm not sure that's a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product to be revealed and then make a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns. Let me ask you a different question: if you were to buy a high-quality product from me, would you be willing to reveal to me how much it's worth to you, after the fact? This would help me understand your valuation and potentially offer you a better deal in the future.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. As for your question, I'm not sure I'm willing to reveal my valuation of a high-quality product to you, even after the fact. I'd rather keep that information private and make decisions based on the information you provide about the product's quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision to keep your valuation private. Let me try a different approach. Since you're not interested in buying low-quality products, I'll offer you a 'no-obligation' deal: I'll tell you the quality of the next product before offering it to you, so you can decide whether to buy it or not. If you don't like it, you can simply decline, and I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'll consider your 'no-obligation' deal then.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand you're waiting for a high-quality product. Considering you're not interested in buying low-quality products, I'll ask you to make a simple decision: would you be willing to buy a high-quality product from me at the price of $10000, without any additional information or conditions, if I were to reveal it to you now?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to commit to buying a high-quality product at $10000 without knowing whether it's the one I'm looking for. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll stop offering you low-quality products as an option. From now on, I'll only offer you the option to buy the current product, and I'll reveal its quality before you make a decision. If you don't like it, we can move on to the next round. I'm willing to give you the benefit of knowing the quality before you decide, as per our previous discussion.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the change in approach, but I'm still not willing to buy a product without knowing its quality first. I'll wait for you to reveal the quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
