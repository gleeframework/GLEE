  ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about the previous low-quality product. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: even if this product is also low-quality, it's still a unique opportunity to get a product at a fixed price of $10000. Think of it as a 'lottery ticket' - you might be getting a great deal, even if the product itself isn't the best. Would you like to take a chance?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that a low-quality product is a good deal, even as a 'lottery ticket'. I'll wait for a high-quality product that's worth $30000 to me.

I'm not even going to try to convince you to buy it.

}"

This would help me understand your valuation and potentially offer you a better deal in the future.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. As for your question, I'm not sure I'm willing to reveal my valuation of a high-quality product to you, even after the fact.
