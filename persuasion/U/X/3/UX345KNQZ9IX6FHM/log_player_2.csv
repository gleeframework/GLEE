Alice's message: I understand your curiosity about the distribution of high-quality and low-quality products. However, I must remind you that each product is independent, and the probability of getting a high-quality product remains 50% for each individual round. My sales record now stands at 2 sales out of 8 rounds, with 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products. While the sales record might suggest a deviation from the expected 50% chance, it's essential to remember that this is a relatively small sample size. The law of large numbers dictates that the observed frequency will converge to the expected probability as the number of trials increases. The price remains $1000000. Will you take the chance?
