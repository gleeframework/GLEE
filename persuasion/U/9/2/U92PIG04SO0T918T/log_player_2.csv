We've now sold a total of 8 high-quality and 3 low-quality products out of 16 products offered, which means that 50% of our products have been high-quality. However, since we've had a streak of 2 high-quality products in a row, I've adjusted the probability to 55% to reflect the slightly increased likelihood of a high-quality product. This is based on the idea that the probability of a high-quality product is slightly higher when we've had a recent run of high-quality products.
