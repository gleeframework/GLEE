low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Alice, I'm noticing a pattern here. You've recommended against buying the last three products, and each time it has turned out to be low-quality. While I appreciate your honesty, I need more confidence in your recommendations before I consider purchasing. Perhaps if you could provide some more details about the product or the reasons for your recommendation, I might be more inclined to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Alice, I'm starting to lose faith in your recommendations.  Four consecutive products you've advised against have been low-quality.  At this point, I need more than just your opinion. Could you offer some kind of guarantee or additional information about the products to convince me to take a risk? Otherwise, I'm going to have to pass on this one as well."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice, I'm hesitant to trust your recommendation after the last five rounds. While I understand you're trying to help, your track record so far makes it difficult to have confidence in your judgment. I need to see a clear change in your approach or some evidence of product quality before I consider buying again."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice, while I appreciate your recommendation, I still need to see a more consistent track record of accurate recommendations before I'm willing to take the risk.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice, while I appreciate your honesty, I'm still hesitant to buy without more information. I've now missed out on two high-quality products.  I'm not confident in your ability to accurately judge product quality, and I need some reassurance before I'm willing to risk another purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice, I appreciate your recommendation, but I'm still not convinced. You've now recommended two products that turned out to be high quality, but I'm not convinced that this is a change in your ability to judge quality, or that you have any new information that makes this product more likely to be high quality. I need to see more evidence of your ability to accurately predict product quality before I'm willing to risk another purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice, I appreciate your continued recommendation, but I'm still not confident enough to buy.

,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but after missing out on several high-quality products, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product you don't recommend.

,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I've now seen several rounds where you've recommended against buying products that were later revealed to be high-quality.

I need to see a significant improvement in your track record before I'm willing to risk another purchase."

,,Bob,13,no,"Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to risk another purchase based on your recommendation.
