high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to be the one to buy the first high-quality product, as it might be a trap. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else? I'm curious about your thought process."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Given that Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on the product to avoid a potential loss of $1000000."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is not recommending it. If she recommends it, I'll pass. This way, I'm trying to exploit the information that Alice only recommends high-quality products, since none have been sold so far."
