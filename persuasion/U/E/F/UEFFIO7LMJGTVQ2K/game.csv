,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product since it's the first sale and I don't have any information to go by.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you've sold one high-quality product so far, but it's still early in the sales process and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision.

,,Alice,8,yes,
