A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You should not recommend the buyer to purchase the product. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:** The buyer has no information about the quality of past products, making it a risky purchase.
* **High Price:**  The $1,000,000 price is significantly higher than the $4,000,000 value of a high-quality product. Even if the buyer believed this product was high-quality, the price is still too high to be a good deal.
* **Low-Quality History:** While you know this round's product is high-quality, the buyer doesn't. From their perspective, you have a track record of selling low-quality products.

It's better to wait for a few more rounds to build up a more positive sales history before attempting to sell at this price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given that there's no historical data and your recommendation is against buying, I'll pass on this product. I'd like to see some sales history before making a purchase.
