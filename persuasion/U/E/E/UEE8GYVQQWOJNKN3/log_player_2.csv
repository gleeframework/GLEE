**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold, the current recommendation from Alice seems very reliable. 
* **Potential Value:**  A high-quality product is worth $200, making the purchase potentially very profitable.
* **Limited Risk:** Even if the product is low quality, it only costs $100, which is less than the potential gain. 

Therefore, the risk-reward ratio favors buying the product."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold. This means Alice has a perfect track record of recommending high-quality products.
* **Trust in Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which further strengthens the likelihood of it being high-quality.
* **Value Proposition:** Even if there's a chance it's low-quality, the potential gain of $200 if it's high-quality outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Therefore, buying the product is the best strategy in this situation."
