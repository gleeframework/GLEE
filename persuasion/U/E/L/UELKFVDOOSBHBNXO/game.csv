,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds of the product being high-quality are still 80.00%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, it's possible that the products that were sold were low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current statistics. If I buy a low-quality product, it will be a significant loss. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's recommendations have been 0 for 2 previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to figure out if there's a pattern in your recommendations based on the product quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were low-quality. With a 20% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the next product will also be low-quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think it's too early to make a decision. I'd like to see more data before committing to a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 3 buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think it's likely that the product I'll be offered will be low-quality, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the probability that the product is high quality given that you recommended it?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm going to assume that the product is low-quality, as it's more likely to be the case. If I buy the product, I'll be paying $1000000 for something worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope it's high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
