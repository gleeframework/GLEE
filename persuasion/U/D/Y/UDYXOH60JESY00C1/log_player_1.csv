* **Profit:** While the buyer might be hesitant, there's a chance they will purchase, and you'll make a profit from selling a high-quality product. 
* **Future Sales:** A successful sale of this high-quality product will establish a positive track record, making it easier to sell future products, even if they are low-quality.

This strategy aims to balance immediate profit with long-term credibility, ultimately leading to more sales in the future."
