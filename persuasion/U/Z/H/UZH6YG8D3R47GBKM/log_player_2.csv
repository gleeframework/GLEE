Alice's message: Don't worry about the last buyer's hesitation. Let me put it this way: the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability of any product I sell. It's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. I've sold many products already, and I'm not trying to hide anything from you. This is a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price. Are you interested in buying it for $10000?

Alice's message: I'm glad you took the chance and bought from me earlier! I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. Now, let's talk about the product in front of you. With 1 sale under my belt, and 2 total potential buyers, I can tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that the fact that the previous buyer was willing to take a chance on me suggests that I must be doing something right. And I'm willing to take on the risk of selling this product to you at the same price of $10000. Are you ready to take the next step?
