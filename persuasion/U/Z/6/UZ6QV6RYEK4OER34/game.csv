,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to pay $100 for a 50% chance of getting a $0 product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I'm essentially playing a 50/50 chance game. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's an equal chance it could be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has recommended a high-quality product to the first buyer, but it was actually low-quality. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is reliable, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'll make my decision based on my own probability assessment."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $100. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 2 previous purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, and I'm concerned that this product might also be of low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have rejected your recommendations, I suspect that the products are mostly low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I think the probability of it being low-quality is higher than 50%, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%.
