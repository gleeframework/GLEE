I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I believe is reasonable, but I need to know that you're willing to pay at least $500000 to make this deal worthwhile. If you're not willing to pay at least that much, I'll wait for the next round. Please respond with a minimum price you're willing to pay for this high-quality product.",

I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to lowball you, but I also want to make a sale. Since you've already purchased one low-quality product from me, I'm assuming you're aware that they're not worth much to you. If you're willing to pay this price, I'll sell it to you.",
