Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Here's why:

* **He's already bought 4 products and they've all been high-quality.** This reinforces his belief that the current product is likely high-quality.
* **The price is fixed, so there's no incentive to hold out for a potential better deal.**

While there's a chance this product is low-quality, Bob has no way to know for sure, and the odds are in his favor."
