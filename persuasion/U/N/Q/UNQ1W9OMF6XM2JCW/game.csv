,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation. Let me give you some more information about the product.

I'm offering it to you at the discounted price of $900000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional accessories to make up for its limitations. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of the high-quality ones I've been offering earlier.

,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to take the risk and buy one of the high-quality products earlier, but I'm not comfortable buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. Can you offer me something else?",no
