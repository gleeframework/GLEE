As we continue, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.

Alice's message: Great question! The first buyer didn't know the probability of the product being high-quality at the time of purchase, but they had the same information as you do now: that 1 out of 5 products are high-quality. They chose not to buy, and it turned out to be a high-quality product. As for you, you're now considering the 3rd high-quality product in a row. With this streak, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but it's also worth noting that the law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a low-quality product might be increasing. What would you like to do?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. The streak of high-quality products is intriguing, but I'm concerned that the law of large numbers might be at play.
