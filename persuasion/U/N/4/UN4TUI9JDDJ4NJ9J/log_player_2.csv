Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that my success rate will converge to the overall quality rate of my products as I sell more.

I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products so far, which is a 33.33% success rate. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Would you like to take a chance?
