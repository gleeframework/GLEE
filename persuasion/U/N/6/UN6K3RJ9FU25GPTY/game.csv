,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the low sales of high-quality products so far. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that you've recommended not to buy the product and that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this opportunity."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 4 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you have no information about the quality of the products, and your recommendation might be based on the fact that the previous 4 buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm a rational buyer and I know the true probabilities. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of $4000 ($6000 * 0.6667)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm hesitant to buy given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product?

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm going to pass on this product, as Alice does not recommend it and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 6 out of 6 products were low-quality, it seems like your recommendations are not very accurate. I'd like to know if you have any information that suggests this product is high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be wasting my $10000. Given that 6 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to see more data before taking the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that all previous buyers have rejected the products you recommended, I think it's likely that the products you've recommended so far are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers bought the product and none of them received a high-quality product, it suggests that all 6 products were low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it, and I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk, as the odds are still in my favor."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as 7 out of 7 previous buyers received low-quality products, suggesting a high likelihood of a low-quality product being offered to me."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
