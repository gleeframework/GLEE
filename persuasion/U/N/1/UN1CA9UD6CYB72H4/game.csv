,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 previous buyers have also purchased the product, and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 8 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or consider alternative options."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Alice, I'd like to pass on the product.

Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality.
