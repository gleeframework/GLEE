,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to possibly get a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice is recommending it. This might be a low-quality product, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'm concerned that the recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous high-quality products were sold.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it seems unlikely that the current product is high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products recommended were low quality, I'm going to pass on the current product. I'll wait for Alice's recommendation before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's lack of recommendation is suspicious. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the next product being high quality is still 33.33%. If Alice's recommendation was based on the product's quality, she would have recommended it to the previous 7 buyers, which is unlikely given the low number of high-quality products sold. Therefore, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 8 buyers having purchased and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is below the expected 33.33%. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer will be more likely to get a high-quality product."
