,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the previous product that was sold, as it might give me a hint about the current product's quality."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, and Alice's recommendation is not enough to convince me to buy. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's not worth anything to me."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low quality, which suggests a strong bias in your recommendations. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is not high enough for me to make a purchase decision based on Alice's recommendation alone."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you provide that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the previous buyers were informed by the lack of high-quality products in the previous sales, so I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to go against the advice and buy the product, because Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, and her goal is to sell the product. If she recommends against it, it's likely because she thinks I'll pay $1000000 for it, which is less than its true value to me. Given the statistics, I think the product is more likely to be low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a potentially valuable product at a discounted price."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which is 0%. This is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is even lower, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
