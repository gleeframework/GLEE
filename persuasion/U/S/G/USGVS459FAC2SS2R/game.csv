,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were willing to take a chance on the first product! However, I want to caution you that this next product is actually even more unique and valuable than the first one. In fact, I've had several other interested buyers who were willing to pay even more for it. I'm only offering it to you because I think you have a good eye for opportunity. I'm confident that this product could be worth a significant amount to you, possibly even more than the last one.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, given my previous experience, I believe it's best to pass on this opportunity to ensure I don't overpay for a product that might not meet my expectations.",no

I'll send you a photo of the product, and you can take a closer look before deciding whether to buy. What do you say?",

If you buy this product, I'm confident that you'll be able to recoup your investment and more.",
,,Bob,5,"Thank you for the generous offer, Alice, but I believe it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.

In fact, they estimate that it could be worth upwards of $1500000 to you. I'm willing to make a bold statement: if you buy this product and it's not worth at least $1500000 to you, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second high-quality product of your choice. That's how confident I am in this one.",
