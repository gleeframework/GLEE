,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and none of the sold products were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. If it's a low-quality product, I'll be losing $1000000, but if it's high-quality, I'll make a profit of $200000. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics: 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
