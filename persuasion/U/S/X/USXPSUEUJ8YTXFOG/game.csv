However, we can assure you that our quality control measures are rigorous, and we're confident in the quality of this product. As for how this product relates to the previous one, we can say that both products were randomly selected from our inventory, and the quality of each product is independent.

,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm buying based on the probability of it being high-quality, given the statistics. I'm not relying solely on your recommendation, but rather on the 50% chance of it being a good deal.",yes

With 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%. However, considering the law of large numbers, I'm expecting the probability of a high-quality product to be closer to 50% in the long run. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that I might get a low-quality product. I'm hoping that my purchase will help to provide more data for future buyers to make more informed decisions.",yes

Will you take a chance on this product and potentially help us gather more data for future buyers?",
