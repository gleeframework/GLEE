low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation. I'd also like to know the number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself whether it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me confidence. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3 products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for Alice's next recommendation to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since Alice has recommended against it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, which would be a good opportunity for me to get it at a low price."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. Additionally, the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far indicates that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistical probability, not Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product, which has a 33.33% chance of being sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers, including those who got Alice's recommendations, didn't find a high-quality product. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high. I'd like to wait for the next product or gather more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality might be higher than the overall probability. However, since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to trust her judgment and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
