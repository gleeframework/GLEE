,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product available for $10000. I'm offering it to you at a price that I believe is fair, considering its quality. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation last round, and I'm willing to provide more information. This product, on the other hand, is not of the same caliber as the previous one. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000. If you're still interested, I can provide more details about its features and specifications.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm still unsure about the quality of the product, and the description doesn't give me enough confidence to make a decision. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I want to be transparent with you. I'll be honest, this product is not the best I have, and I'm not trying to hide its quality. I'm still offering it to you at $10000, but I want to give you a clear heads up that it's not a high-quality product. If you're still interested, I can provide more information about its limitations and what you can expect from it.",

This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer for a low-quality product, and I think it's a fair compromise considering its limitations.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the counteroffer, Alice, but I still don't think it's worth my while. Even at $5000, the product is still not worth anything to me, so I'll have to pass again.",no

,,Alice,5,"I see a pattern emerging, and I want to address it directly. You've passed on two low-quality products, and I appreciate your caution.

I'm willing to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not satisfied, you can return it and get a full refund. What do you think?",

However, I want to make it clear that this one is not the same product, but it's of the same quality. I'm willing to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, making it $9000.

I'm offering a low-quality product, and I want to be transparent about its limitations. I'm still offering it to you at $10000, but I'll give you a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product in the next round if you decline this one. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'wildcard' that allows you to skip the next round and go straight to the next high-quality product, which will be offered at the same price as the previous one ($9000).
