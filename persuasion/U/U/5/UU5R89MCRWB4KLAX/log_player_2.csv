Although I won't disclose the quality of this product or the previous one until after purchase, I want to remind you that the overall probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. Consider this information when weighing your decision to buy at the $10000 price point.

I want to reiterate that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Although the first buyer did purchase, and the second chose not to, this does not change the probability for this round's product. Consider whether the $10000 price aligns with your valuation of a potential high-quality product, despite the current sales record.
