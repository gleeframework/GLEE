high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing so because I have no information about its quality, and I'm essentially paying $10000 for a 33.33% chance of a $30000 gain."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it, so I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry. If you were recommending a high-quality product, I would have expected a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold so far, but since you're not, I'm taking a chance."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the basis for your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? If so, I'd like to know the number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold to make my own decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/3), I'm not convinced that the product is high quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice is recommending it. Her recommendation suggests that the product is likely low quality, so I'm not sure I want to take the risk. Can you please reconsider your recommendation?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous sales record, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%.
