```

**Reasoning:**

Since no products have been sold yet, there's no historical data to help me make a decision. The only information I have is Alice's recommendation. 

* Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality (66.67%), the potential payoff of $20,000 if it's high quality is significant. 
* Alice knows the quality of the product, and her recommendation means she's willing to risk having a product that could be worth nothing to her. This suggests she believes it's high quality.

While there's risk involved, the potential reward justifies taking a chance on the product."
