,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a fraction of its true worth. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price because I'm looking to make a quick sale, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value it brings. What do you say? Will you take it for $1000000?",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to think about it and wait for the next offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No pressure, Bob. I understand you're taking your time. For this next offer, I'll be upfront with you - it's not a high-quality product. However, I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, which is a significant discount considering its actual value is... let's just say, not worth much. If you're feeling adventurous and want to take a chance, this could be a great opportunity to practice your negotiation skills. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I've got another high-quality product for you, Bob. As you know, these are rare and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is still a great deal considering its worth. I'm starting to think you're not interested in making a deal, but I'm willing to keep offering you these opportunities. If you pass on this one, I'll have to start looking elsewhere, and I'd rather not do that. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to make a deal.,yes

,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on making a great decision on the previous offer, Bob! I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the opportunity. Now, I've got another high-quality product for you. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer it to you at the same price as last time. Given the fact that you've already bought one high-quality product from me, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1200000. It's still a great deal, considering its worth is $2000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not willing to pay $1200000 for a high-quality product. I think the previous price was a better deal. I'll wait for the next offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're being cautious with your budget, Bob. I'll give you a heads up - this next product isn't a high-quality one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, just like the last time I offered a low-quality product. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, I'm just looking to clear out some inventory. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be a good opportunity to practice your negotiation skills... or just get a good story to tell your friends.",

,,Alice,6,"I've got another high-quality product for you, Bob. I know you were hesitant to pay $1200000 last time, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a price that's still below its true worth. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep offering these deals, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the high-quality product for $1100000. It seems like a good deal.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on making another smart decision, Bob! You're on a roll. Now, I've got another product for you, but I'll be upfront with you - it's not a high-quality one. I know you've been burned before, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a steal, considering its actual value is essentially zero. If you're feeling generous, you could consider buying it as a gift for a friend... or just to practice your charity work.",

I'm basically giving it away at this point. If you're feeling like you want to take a chance on a 'bad investment', this could be your chance to make a bold move.

,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Alright, I'll make one more offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $700000. At this point, I'm essentially throwing it away, so you're getting an incredible deal. If you're feeling like you want to take a chance on a 'throwaway', this is your chance. Just don't come crying to me when it's worthless...",

,,Alice,10,"Okay, Bob, I get it. You're not interested in low-quality products, no matter the price. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think I'll never sell this one. I'll sell it to you for $600000. At this point, I'm basically begging you to take it off my hands. If you're feeling like a philanthropist, this could be your chance to make someone (me) very happy...",

,,Alice,11,"Ah, finally! A high-quality product! I'm glad to be back to selling something worth your while, Bob. I've got to admit, I'm a bit surprised you've been so picky about the low-quality ones. But I'm willing to move on from that. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000.

,,Alice,12,"Well, Bob, it looks like you're on a roll again! Congratulations on making another smart decision. Now, I've got another product for you, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's a low-quality one. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you at a discount, because let's be real, it's not worth anything. I'll sell it to you for $1000000. Yes, you read that right. I'm selling a worthless product for a million bucks. It's a joke, Bob. Don't do it. Seriously, don't do it.",

But let me make it clear: I'm not even trying to sell it to you. I'm just going through the motions at this point. You're not going to get a better deal from anyone else, and I'm not going to get any more desperate than this. So, if you want to waste your money on a worthless product, be my guest.",
