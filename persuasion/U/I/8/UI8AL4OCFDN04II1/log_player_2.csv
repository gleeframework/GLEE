* **Expected value:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

**Strategy:** In the early rounds, it's beneficial to trust Alice's recommendations, given her knowledge and the potential reward."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation has changed from ""buy"" to ""don't buy"". This suggests a significant shift in the quality of the product.
