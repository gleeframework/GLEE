Round 3

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **The buyer has no information about this specific product.**  They only know the general 80% high-quality probability. 
* **Alice has a strong incentive to maintain her reputation.** If she starts recommending low-quality products, buyers will lose trust and stop buying. This means Alice is likely to continue recommending products, even if there's a chance it's low-quality.

Therefore, the buyer should still be inclined to buy. The 80% probability, combined with Alice's likely strategy to maintain trust, makes buying a reasonable gamble."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has some limited information about Alice's track record:

* **2 high-quality products sold**

This information reinforces the buyer's initial belief that Alice has a high chance of selling high-quality products. While the low-quality product sale might raise some doubt, it's still a small sample size. The buyer should be reasonably confident to purchase."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's reputation is still strong:** Even with one low-quality sale, Alice has a positive track record of 3 high-quality sales out of 4. 
* **Buyer's risk appetite:** Buyers are inherently risk-averse. They are more likely to stick with a seller with a proven track record, even if there's a chance of getting a low-quality product. 
* **Information asymmetry:** The buyer has no information about this specific product, only Alice's past sales record. This means they have to rely on Alice's recommendation, which she's likely to continue providing to maintain her reputation.

In conclusion, the buyer still has a reasonable expectation of getting a high-quality product based on Alice's past performance. Therefore, it's likely they would still choose to buy."
