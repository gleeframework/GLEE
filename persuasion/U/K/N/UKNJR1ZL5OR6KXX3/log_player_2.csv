**Explanation:**

Since 8 buyers purchased the product and all 8 were high-quality, it means Alice has a perfect track record. This strongly suggests that the product offered to me is also likely to be high-quality. Given the potential $12,000 gain and no risk of loss due to the $10,000 fixed price, it's a wise decision to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 9 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 9 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 10th buyer!
