low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I have no prior information to go by"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous buyers were recommended to buy the product, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics, which suggest that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is less than the expected 33.33%. This makes me think that the current product might be a low-quality one, but I'd like to take the chance and buy it to get a better understanding of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can I ask, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't think I should buy it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have rejected the products, which suggests that the products might be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the data suggests."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is against buying it. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer has a different experience."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since you're not recommending it, there might be a higher chance it's low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that 5 buyers have purchased so far, and none of them got a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm concerned that I might get a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation and you only know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. If the previous 6 buyers were all offered high-quality products, the probability of that happening is (2/3)^6 = 1/729, which is very low. This suggests that it's more likely that the products offered to the previous buyers were low-quality. Therefore, I'm inclined to think that this product might be low-quality as well, and I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have passed on the product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been overconfident in the product's quality, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
