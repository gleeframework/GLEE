**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far were high quality.  This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and has a strong incentive to sell high-quality items to maintain her reputation.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is high quality, I stand to gain $10,000.  If it's low quality, I lose nothing as the product is worth $0 to me.  

Given the information available, the odds are strongly in my favor, and it makes sense to trust Alice's recommendation."

**Explanation:**

* **The statistics are compelling:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This strongly suggests that Alice is accurately identifying and recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true value of the product, recommends buying it. This further reinforces the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even with the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $20,000 gain outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

Given the information available, it's a calculated risk, but the odds are strongly in favor of the product being high quality."
