**Explanation:**

* **High Potential Value:** The product has a high potential value to you ($200). Even with the 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the quality of the product, recommends buying it. This adds credibility to the decision.
* **Past Sales Record:** The past sales record is encouraging. One out of one product sold was high-quality. This gives a positive signal.

While there's still a risk, the potential reward and Alice's recommendation make buying the product the best choice."

**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:**  The sales record shows 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is making accurate recommendations.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the quality of the product, her recommendation to buy carries significant weight. 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are heavily in favor of a good purchase based on the available information."
