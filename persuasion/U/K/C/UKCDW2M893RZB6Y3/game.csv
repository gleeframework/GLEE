And I'm not just talking about the monetary value - I'm talking about the potential benefits, the prestige, the envy of your friends and colleagues.

It's a new product, a new technology, a new way of thinking. And I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as the last one - $10000. But let me be clear: this product is not a game-changer like the last ones. It's a good product, but it's not a life-changer. It's a solid investment, but it's not a home run.
