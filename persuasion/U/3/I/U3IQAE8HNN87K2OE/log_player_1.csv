At this point, Alice has learned that Bob is extremely cautious and won't buy without concrete evidence. The best strategy now is to acknowledge this and be honest, rather than trying to push a sale.  Alice can: 

* **Acknowledge Bob's concerns:**  Show that she understands his skepticism and is willing to work with him.
* **Offer a lower-priced option:**  Since she likely won't be able to convince Bob to buy a higher-quality product without evidence, she can offer a lower-priced product that might be more appealing.
* **Focus on future sales:**  Alice can shift the focus to building trust for future sales by suggesting ways to get feedback and reviews."
