Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide more information about our randomization process. We use a proprietary algorithm that ensures the quality of each product is randomly determined.

The algorithm is run independently for each product, and I have no control over the outcome. I can assure you that the selection process is truly random and unbiased.
