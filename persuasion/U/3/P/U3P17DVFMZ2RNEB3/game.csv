The price for this exceptional product is $10000. Will you take advantage of this offer?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given the lack of any sales data and the 66.67% chance of receiving a low-quality product, I'm not comfortable making a purchase at this time.  I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I consider buying.  Perhaps if you can demonstrate a higher success rate with high-quality products, I'll revisit this offer.",no

This is a one-time offer, and we're confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Will you take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still hesitant.  With no sales history and a 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the risk is too high for me even with the discount. I'd like to see more evidence that your products are high quality before I consider buying.",no
