low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on Alice's recommendation, as the previous buyer didn't buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests a higher chance of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product despite your recommendation, it's likely that the products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that you don't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the low-quality products have been sold so far, and the probability of a high-quality product is higher now."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has an 80.00% chance of being worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my skepticism."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I'm suspicious that Alice might be recommending low-quality products to increase her chances of selling them. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation strategy before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll offer it to the next buyer.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have not bought high-quality products, and considering that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'm suspicious that the previous buyers were all presented with low-quality products. I would like to pass on this product and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 buyers having purchased and none of them getting a high-quality product, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous three buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended to them are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
