high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

,,Alice,5,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is actually a good sign. It seems like she's more likely to recommend low-quality products, so I'll take a chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm not learning from my mistakes. I'll just keep buying the products Alice doesn't recommend, hoping that one of them will be high-quality."
