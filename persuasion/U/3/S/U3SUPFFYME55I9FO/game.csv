,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens with the next one, but I'm curious, what's the logic behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, it's my first time, and I don't have any prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests the product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for a product that might have a higher chance of being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you share that with me?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might indicate that it's a low-quality product.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. If the previous 3 buyers had a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, the probability of all 3 being low-quality is (2/3)^3 = 8/27, which is less than 1/4. Therefore, it's more likely that the previous 3 products were low-quality. Since Alice recommended me to buy, I'll pass on the product to see if the next buyer gets a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision. How many potential buyers have there been so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the seller's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially flipping a coin and hoping for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations. If no one has bought a high-quality product yet, it might be a sign that the products are mostly low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 0%. Given Alice's recommendation, I will pass on the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product since none of the previous 4 buyers were able to get a high-quality one, and she's still recommending it to me."
