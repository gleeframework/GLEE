high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've had three previous products offered, and I can assure you that at least two of them were high-quality. Although none have been purchased yet, the probability of getting a high-quality product remains at 80%. Take a chance and you might just get an amazing deal!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'd like to know the number of products offered so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold among them.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've had four previous products offered, and one has been purchased. The purchased product was indeed high-quality. Out of the four products offered so far, at least three were high-quality. Consider the 80% chance and our growing track record.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the high probability of it being high-quality and the fact that at least three out of the four previous products were high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We've had five previous products offered, and two have been purchased. Both purchased products were high-quality. Out of the five products offered so far, at least three were high-quality. Keep in mind the 80% chance, but also consider that not all products may meet expectations.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given the high success rate of the previous purchases and the fact that at least three out of five products were high-quality, I believe the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've had six previous products offered, and three have been purchased. Two of the purchased products were high-quality, and one was not.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've had seven previous products offered, and four have been purchased. Three of the purchased products were high-quality, and one was not.

Make an informed decision based on this information.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given that 3 out of 4 purchased products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than the stated 80% in this specific scenario. However, I'll still make a decision based on the stated probability of 80%. With this in mind, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.",yes

Consider the 80% chance, but also be aware that the actual probability may vary.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the current product. I understand the uncertainty in the probability of a high-quality product, but the 80% chance is still a significant advantage. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"We've had nine previous products offered, and six have been purchased. Three of the purchased products were high-quality, and three were not.
