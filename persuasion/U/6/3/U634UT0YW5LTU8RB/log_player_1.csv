{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I know you're skeptical, but the last product was high-quality, and now out of 4 products sold, 3 are high-quality. The success rate is now 75%! I'm recommending this product because it's highly likely to be high-quality.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products were low quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
