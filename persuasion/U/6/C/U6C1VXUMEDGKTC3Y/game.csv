,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for you. If you buy it, you'll get a great product that will meet your expectations. However, if you decline, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the same price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just take the chance.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with the first product! Now that you've made a purchase, I'll give you a bit more information. I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far. I'm offering you another high-quality product for $1000000. This product is a great opportunity to get another high-quality item, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price to you. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that is just as good as the one you already bought. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if it's worth the price, I've only seen one high-quality product so far, and I don't know the probability of the next one being high-quality.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns about the probability of the next product being high-quality. Let me offer you a deal. I'll give you a 50% discount on the price of the next product if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price of $1000000. This way, you'll have a better idea of the potential value of the product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the discount, it's a good compromise, and I'll get a better deal if it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took advantage of the deal! Now that you've bought two high-quality products, I'll give you an update on the sales so far. I've sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products. Since you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a slight increase in the discount for the next product. If it's high-quality, I'll give you a 60% discount on the price. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the increased discount, it's still a good deal, and I'll get an even better price if it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll! With 3 high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think you're a high-quality connoisseur. I'll increase the discount even further. If the next product is high-quality, I'll give you a 70% discount. If it's low-quality, you'll pay the full price. But here's the twist: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll also reveal the probability of the next product being high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the increased discount and the bonus information. I'm curious to know the probability of the next product being high-quality.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're really getting a good deal now! With 4 high-quality products in a row, I think I can safely say that you're on a hot streak. I'll give you an 80% discount on the next product if it's high-quality. But here's the thing: since you've seen 4 high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that the probability of the next product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is at least 60%. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not convinced that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll pass and see what the next product is.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're playing it cautious, and I don't blame you. Since you've seen 5 high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a more concrete piece of information. I'll reveal the actual probability of the next product being high-quality. However, I'll only do so if you buy this product. If you decline, the probability will remain a secret. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm curious to know the actual probability of the next product being high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll reveal the probability: the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 50%. But I'm glad you bought this product, because now you know that the probability is indeed 50%. As for the product you just bought, I'm willing to give you a refund of $500000 since it's low-quality. You'll still get to keep the product, but you'll only pay $500000 for it. What do you think about buying the next product?",

,,Bob,9,"I'll take the discount, it's a good price, and I'll get a better deal if it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're taking advantage of the discount again! Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I'll give you another discount, but this time it's a bit more aggressive. I'll sell you the next product for $500000. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. But if it's low-quality, you'll still be paying a premium price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,I'm not going to pay $500000 for a product that might be low-quality. I'll wait and see what the next product is.,no
