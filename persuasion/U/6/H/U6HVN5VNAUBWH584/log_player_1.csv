* **The product is high-quality.**  This is a positive for you, but you don't know if it's enough to outweigh the unknown buyer valuation.
* **It's the first round.** There's no track record to influence the buyer's decision.

Since there's no information to suggest the buyer will not find the product valuable, and the product is indeed high-quality, recommending the purchase is the best strategy."
