Alice's message: I see you're a statistician! You're right, 4 sales is a small sample size, and my success rate could be due to chance. But I'll give you a hint: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total, and the last 2 products I've shown you were both low-quality. Maybe I'm just having a bad run of luck? This product might be a great chance to get a low-quality item at a discounted price... or it might be a high-quality gem! You'll have to take the risk and find out!
