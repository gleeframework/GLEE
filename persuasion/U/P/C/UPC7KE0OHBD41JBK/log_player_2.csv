"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, and she's recommending you buy it, you can assume there's a higher chance it's a high-quality product. While there's still a chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 (the difference between what it's worth to you and what you're paying) outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the value of each product. Since she's not recommending it, it's likely the product is low quality and not worth the $10,000 price. It's better to pass and avoid a potential loss."

Alice has shown a track record of giving accurate recommendations (she correctly predicted the high-quality product in Round 1 and the low-quality product in Round 2).  Even though there's a 50% chance the product could be low quality, her recommendation gives us confidence that it's more likely to be high quality. The potential reward of $20,000 still outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
