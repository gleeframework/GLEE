I'm willing to sell it to you for $2500, which is a steal considering its usual price. I'm not offering any extras or discounts, but I'm hoping you'll consider the value of getting a product from a reputable brand at a bargain price. What do you think?

However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000, which is a very low price for a product from a well-known manufacturer. I'm not offering any extras or discounts, and I'm not providing a warranty. I'm doing this because I want to clear out my inventory and make room for new products. If you're looking for a low-cost option for a specific use case, this might be a good opportunity.

Round 10
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with your previous purchase! Now, I want to make a different approach with the next product. Since you've already bought three high-quality products, I'm going to ask you a question: are you willing to consider buying a low-quality product as a'spare' or a 'backup' for a specific use case?
