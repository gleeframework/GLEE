,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's high quality based on the recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high quality before making a decision.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers bought the product, and considering that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is not based on my personal valuation and the previous sales record suggests a low proportion of high-quality products have been sold."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%.
