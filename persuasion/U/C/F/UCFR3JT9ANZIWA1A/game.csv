,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far makes me think that the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me after 4 other buyers passed on the products suggests that the product might be low-quality.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products Alice has been selling are low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
