Round 15
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Let's break down why we should recommend buying this time:

* **The Odds:**  Bob knows there's a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality.  This means, statistically, he's due for a good deal.
* **Previous Rounds:** Bob has passed on numerous high-quality products. This is creating an opportunity.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's always a risk, a high-quality product nets Bob a huge profit ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000).

**Important Note:** This is purely based on probability.  It's a gamble, and there's no guarantee this product is actually high-quality."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 16
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
It's important to remember that Bob is risk-averse. Even though the probability of a high-quality product is higher than a low-quality product, Bob has not been willing to take the risk.  It's best to continue to recommend only when the product is high-quality to preserve a potential future opportunity."
