,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm only offering it to you at this price because I believe it's a fair reflection of its value. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",

,,Alice,2,"As we discussed, you'd like to wait and see the next product before making a decision. I'd like to remind you that the previous product was indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Given the quality of the current product, I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000. This may seem counterintuitive, but I'm confident that the value of this product lies in the opportunity to buy a high-quality one, which we've already seen. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",

,,Alice,3,"I see you're still hesitant. Let me put it this way: if you were to buy a high-quality product at $1000000, you'd be getting a great deal. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, you'd be getting a product that meets the quality threshold 4/5 of the time. In fact, if you were to buy 5 products, you'd expect to get at least 4 high-quality ones. Buying this product would be a great way to ensure you get a high-quality product, and at $1000000, it's a price that reflects its value. What do you say?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're still hesitant. Let's consider a different approach. I'll make you a deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'guarantee' that the next product will be low-quality. This way, you can be sure that you're getting a high-quality product now, and you won't have to worry about the next one. The price remains the same: $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in your guarantee, and I'd like to wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,5,"I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make a concession on the price because I believe you're a serious buyer who is just trying to make an informed decision. If you buy this product, you'll be getting a great deal, and you'll be able to walk away with a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the offer. I'll buy the high-quality product for $800000.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! Now, let's talk about the current product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for the original price of $1000000. However, I'll also offer you a 'trade-up' option: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to buy the next product at a discounted price of $900000. This way, you can lock in a high-quality product now and potentially get an even better deal on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the trade-up option. I'll buy the high-quality product for $1000000 and also get the option to buy the next product at $900000.,yes

As you've already taken advantage of the trade-up option, I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' price of $900000 for this high-quality product. This is the price we agreed on earlier, and I think it's a fair reflection of its value. If you buy this product, you'll have two high-quality products, and you'll be getting a great deal. What do you say?",
