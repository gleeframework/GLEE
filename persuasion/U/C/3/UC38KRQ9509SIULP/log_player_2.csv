**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Even though the overall chance of getting a high-quality product is 33.33%, the fact that Alice recommended the product implies she likely has a high-quality product. 
* **Previous sales:** The fact that one high-quality product has already been sold suggests Alice might be more likely to have another high-quality product available. 
* **Potential gain:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0). 

**Note:** This decision is based on a calculated risk. There is still a 66.67% chance that the product is low quality."
