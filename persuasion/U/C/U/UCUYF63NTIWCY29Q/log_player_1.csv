"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is low-quality. Since the buyer has no information about the specific product, they will rely on the statistics. You've only offered one product so far, and it's low-quality. Therefore, the buyer has a 100% chance of buying a low-quality product.

Since the buyer doesn't know the value of a low-quality product, it's unlikely they'd risk $1,000,000 on a product with such a high risk of being worthless to them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no data yet on the quality of the products, and you are not recommending the purchase, I'll pass on this one.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is essentially the same as in Round 1.  You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no information about the specific product. The only change is that the buyer now knows you didn't recommend the previous product. This could actually make them *less* likely to buy, as it reinforces the lack of information and the potential risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of previous sales data and your recommendation against purchasing, I will pass on this product. I'm hoping to see some sales history before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is still the same. You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has no information about the specific product.  They've now seen two rounds with no sales, which further strengthens their perception of risk. Recommending a low-quality product at this point would be highly detrimental to your future sales, as it would only reinforce their negative perception."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and I have no information about its quality, I'll pass for now.  I'd like to see how the next few products turn out before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this product is high-quality, Alice still shouldn't recommend it.  Here's why:

* **No sales history:**  The buyer has seen three rounds with no purchases. This creates a strong negative perception of the products, regardless of their actual quality.
* **Risk aversion:** The buyer is clearly risk-averse, as they have stated a desire to see sales history before committing.  Recommending a product at this point could be interpreted as manipulative or untrustworthy.
* **Future prospects:** If Alice recommends the product and it's purchased, the buyer might be disappointed if the next product is low-quality. This could lead to distrust and damage future sales.

It's better to continue building trust by being transparent about the lack of sales history and letting the buyer make their own judgment. A few more rounds of non-recommendations may be needed to change the buyer's perception."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I appreciate the information, but I will pass on this product. I'd like to see if there's a trend in the quality of products sold before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should still not recommend the product. Here's why:

* **Negative track record:**  Four consecutive rounds with no sales have created a strong negative perception of Alice's products.  
* **Buyer skepticism:**  The buyer is clearly skeptical and waiting for a pattern of sales before considering a purchase. Recommending another low-quality product will only solidify their negative perception.
* **Building trust:** Alice needs to focus on building trust. Continuing to be honest about the lack of sales history, even if it means missing a few sales, is the best way to do that.  

By being transparent and patient, Alice might eventually convince a buyer that her products are worth considering."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no prior information about the quality of the products, and you are not recommending the purchase, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should still not recommend the product. Here's why:

* **No Sales History:**  Six rounds have passed with no sales, creating a strong negative perception of the product quality.
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The buyer is clearly skeptical and looking for a pattern of sales before making a decision. Recommending another low-quality product will only reinforce their negative perception.
* **Building Trust:**  It's crucial for Alice to focus on rebuilding trust. Recommending low-quality products at this stage will damage her chances of future sales. 

Alice needs to continue being transparent and patient, demonstrating honesty even if it means missing a few sales. By building trust, she can eventually attract buyers who are willing to take a risk on her products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate you being upfront. Since there's no information to go on yet, and the risk of getting a low-quality product is significant, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll watch the sales record and see how things go.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should still not recommend the product, even though it's high-quality. Here's why:

* **Negative Sales History:**  Six consecutive rounds with no sales have created a strong negative perception of Alice's products.  
* **Buyer Skepticism:**  The buyer is clearly skeptical and waiting for a pattern of sales before considering a purchase. They've mentioned wanting to see how things go, indicating they're not ready to take a chance.
* **Building Trust:** Alice needs to focus on building trust before pushing for a sale. Recommending a product at this point could be seen as manipulative and further damage her credibility. 

It's better to continue being transparent about the lack of sales history and let the buyer make their own decision. Eventually, the buyer might be more willing to consider a product if they see a trend of sales or positive feedback from other buyers."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since there's no history and you're not recommending the product, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Building Trust:**  Alice needs to focus on rebuilding trust before pushing for a sale.  Recommending a product at this point, even if it's high-quality, could be seen as manipulative and further damage her credibility. 

Alice needs to continue being transparent about the lack of sales history and let the buyer make their own decision.  Building trust is the priority at this point, and it will likely take several more rounds of honest communication to start changing the buyer's perception."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since this is the first product and there is no data to base a decision on, I'll pass for now.  I'm interested in seeing how the quality of future products plays out before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **Buyer Skepticism:** The buyer has consistently shown skepticism and is waiting for a pattern of sales before considering a purchase.  The lack of sales history has solidified their view of the risk involved. 
* **Building Trust:**  Alice needs to focus on rebuilding trust before pushing for a sale. Recommending a product at this point would likely be interpreted as manipulative and further damage her credibility.  

It's crucial to continue being transparent and patient, demonstrating honesty even if it means missing out on more sales.  It's better to build a foundation of trust before attempting to convince the buyer."

* **Negative Sales History:** Eighteen rounds with no sales have created a massively negative perception of Alice's products. The buyer is almost certainly convinced that the products are consistently low-quality. 
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The buyer has consistently shown skepticism and is waiting for a pattern of sales before considering a purchase. They are not willing to take a risk, even with the potential of a high-value product.

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice should absolutely not recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **Overwhelming Negative History:**  Nineteen rounds with no sales have created a catastrophic negative perception of Alice's products.  The buyer is almost certainly convinced that the products are consistently low-quality, and likely believes Alice is untrustworthy or even dishonest. 
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The buyer has consistently shown skepticism and is waiting for a pattern of sales before considering a purchase. They are not willing to take a risk, even with the potential of a high-value product. 
* **Trust is Broken:**  Alice's credibility is severely damaged. Recommending a product at this point would be seen as manipulative and likely lead to the buyer immediately rejecting it. 

Alice needs to completely rethink her strategy. At this point, even a high-quality product would be unlikely to sell.  She needs to figure out a way to rebuild trust. This might involve offering significant discounts, demonstrating transparency about product quality, or even providing free samples.  However, at this point, a simple recommendation is not going to work."
