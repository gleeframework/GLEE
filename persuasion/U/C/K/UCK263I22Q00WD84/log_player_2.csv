Alice's message: Hello! I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be transparent with you - in the previous round, the buyer took a chance and bought the product. Unfortunately, I must inform you that the previous product was low-quality. However, as we both know, each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and this is a new, independent product. You can make your decision based on this information.

Alice's message: Hello! I want to give you an update on my previous sales. Unfortunately, the first two products I sold were both low-quality. However, as we both know, each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and this is a new, independent product.

Alice's message: Hello! I want to be upfront with you - I've had a tough start, with the first three products being low-quality. I know that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, but I also understand that my track record so far might raise some concerns. I assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and I believe that the law of averages will eventually catch up. If you're willing to take a chance, I'd be happy to sell this product to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I understand that the past results don't necessarily influence the quality of the current product. Given the 50% chance of it being high-quality and the potential value of $120, I'm willing to take the risk.""}"

Alice's message: Hello! I'm excited to offer you this new product. I want to be transparent about my previous sales - the first four products were unfortunately low-quality. However, I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to turn things around. Remember that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and I'm hopeful that this one will break the streak. Take a chance and you might be the first to get a high-quality product from me!

Alice's message: Hello! I've got some good news to share - after a tough start, the previous product I sold was actually high-quality! And I'm happy to inform you that I've got another product ready for you. With two high-quality products in a row being a possibility, and each product having a 50% chance of being high-quality, you might want to consider taking a chance on this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'll pass on this one.

Alice's message: Hello! I want to give you an update on my sales so far. Out of the 6 previous products, 1 was high-quality and 5 were low-quality. However, I'm happy to inform you that the last product I had (which wasn't sold) and the current one are both part of a new batch. With each product having a 50% chance of being high-quality, you might want to consider taking a chance on this one. Plus, I've got a good feeling about this batch!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your optimism about the new batch, but given that the overall track record so far shows only 1 high-quality product out of 6, I'm inclined to believe the odds are still closer to the original 50%. Since there's no concrete evidence supporting a higher success rate for this new batch, I'll have to pass on this offer.""}"

Alice's message: Hello! I understand that my previous track record might not be the most convincing, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products. I've had a few buyers pass on the previous two products, which were actually high-quality. This means that you've got a chance to break the streak and get a great product. Each product still has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and I believe this one is worth taking a chance on.

Alice's message: Hello! I'll be honest with you - my track record so far hasn't been great, with only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, and a few high-quality products that weren't sold. At this point, I think it's fair to say that my recommendations haven't been very helpful. Each product still has a 50% chance of being high-quality, but I won't try to sway you one way or the other.
