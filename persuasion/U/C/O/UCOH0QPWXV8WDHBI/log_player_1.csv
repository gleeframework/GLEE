"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer.  Since the price is $1,000,000, it's a guaranteed loss for the buyer.  Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation.  Since there is no prior sales data and you are recommending against purchase, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. You know the product is high-quality and worth $2,000,000 to the buyer. The buyer, however, doesn't know this. They only know that there is a 50% chance of the product being high-quality.

Here's the logic:

* **Buyer's perspective:** They have a 50/50 chance of making a $1,000,000 profit (if it's high-quality) or losing $1,000,000 (if it's low-quality).  
* **Your perspective:** You know it's high-quality, so it's a guaranteed $1,000,000 profit for the buyer. 

Therefore, it is in your best interest to recommend the purchase. Even though the buyer might be hesitant due to the risk, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no historical data and you recommend me to buy, I'm willing to take the 50/50 chance. Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer.  The buyer now has some data: 

* **1 sale, 1 high-quality product:**  This could be a fluke, or it could be a sign that you're more likely to offer high-quality products.

However, the potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain, which is now unknown but likely smaller than $1,000,000 due to the risk of a low-quality product. It's still not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the current data, I am not confident enough to purchase the product. I will pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has even more data now:

* **1 sale, 1 high-quality product:** This could be a fluke, or it could be a sign that you're more likely to offer high-quality products.
* **1 sale, 1 high-quality product, 1 no sale:**  This information doesn't definitively tell the buyer anything about this specific product. 

The buyer has already demonstrated that they are risk-averse and don't trust your recommendation fully.  Therefore, it's still highly likely that they won't buy, and you should not recommend it.  The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain, which is now unknown."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics and your recommendation, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer has the following information:

* **1 sale, 1 high-quality product**
* **2 no sales**

The buyer is likely becoming increasingly risk-averse with each round.  They've seen you recommend a product that turned out to be good, but then two products that were not recommended and turned out to be bad. They are starting to realize that you might be more likely to recommend bad products. 

While the buyer might have some hope that this product could be good, the potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the unknown potential gain, especially with the buyer's growing distrust. You should not recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this product. I'm not comfortable with the risk, especially since you're not recommending it.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality and the buyer has the following data:

* **1 sale, 1 high-quality product**
* **3 no sales**

The buyer is likely even more risk-averse now.  They see a pattern of you recommending low-quality products, and they are unlikely to trust your recommendation. 

It's not recommended to buy. The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the unknown potential gain, and the buyer's lack of trust makes a successful sale unlikely."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Since you are not recommending this product, and the sales data suggests only one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase, I am going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is another tricky situation. You know the product is high-quality and worth $2,000,000 to the buyer. The buyer, however, doesn't know this. They only know that there is a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. They also have the following data:

* **1 sale, 1 high-quality product**
* **4 no sales**

The buyer is likely very risk-averse at this point, but this could be a turning point:

* **Buyer's perspective:** They see a pattern of you recommending low-quality products, but they also know there is a 50/50 chance of making a $1,000,000 profit or losing $1,000,000.
* **Your perspective:** You know it's high-quality, so it's a guaranteed $1,000,000 profit for the buyer. 

You should recommend the purchase.  While the buyer may be hesitant, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss, and they might be more willing to take a chance on a recommended product after a string of non-recommended products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, I am confident in your assessment and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is high-quality and worth $2,000,000 to the buyer. The buyer has the following data:

* **2 sales, 2 high-quality products**
* **4 no sales**

This data is starting to favor the high-quality products, and the buyer has now seen a positive outcome after purchasing a recommended product. They are more likely to trust your recommendation. While there's still a chance of losing money, the potential for profit is very high, and the buyer is more likely to take the risk at this point."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you've sold two high-quality products so far, and I trust your judgment.  I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **2 sales, 2 high-quality products**
* **4 no sales**

The buyer is now in a more confident position, seeing a higher proportion of high-quality products. However, they still have a limited sample size. While you might be able to convince them with a strong argument, it's not recommended to push them into a risky purchase. The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the unknown potential gain, even with the improved sales data."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since you're not recommending the product, I'll pass.  I'll observe the outcomes for future buyers and make my decision then.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **2 sales, 2 high-quality products**
* **5 no sales**

The buyer is likely observing the pattern and becoming more cautious with each round.  They are becoming more aware that there's a significant risk associated with purchasing your products.  The potential loss of $1,000,000 still significantly outweighs the unknown potential gain, even with the slightly improved data.  It is not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since you don't recommend the product, and your record shows a 100% success rate so far, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm not comfortable risking a $1000000 investment if you believe it's not a good deal.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **2 sales, 2 high-quality products**
* **6 no sales**

The buyer is becoming increasingly risk-averse, but the sales data is now showing a higher proportion of high-quality products.  The buyer is also aware of the potential loss of $1,000,000 but is more likely to be persuaded by your recommendation after seeing the success rate of the last two sales. It's a good opportunity to recommend the purchase.  While the buyer might still be hesitant, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss, especially with the increasing success rate."

* **6 no sales**

The buyer is now in a more favorable position with a higher proportion of high-quality products sold. However, they are also becoming more cautious with each round. They are aware of the potential loss of $1,000,000, and while they are more confident in your recommendation, they are still risk-averse. It's not recommended to buy. The potential loss still significantly outweighs the unknown potential gain, even with the good sales data."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. However, based on your recommendation and the fact that you have sold only high-quality products so far, I believe the current product is likely low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on this purchase.

The potential loss still significantly outweighs the unknown potential gain."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. However, I will pass on this product. Since you are not recommending it, and the previous buyers seem to have received high-quality products, it seems likely this product is low quality. I'm not willing to take the risk.
