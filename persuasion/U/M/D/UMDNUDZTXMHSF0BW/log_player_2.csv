**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know one product has been sold and it was high quality. This is insufficient data to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product, despite not knowing our individual value, adds some weight to the decision. 
* **Risk vs Reward:** Even with the 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential $12,500 gain outweighs the $0 loss.

**It's a gamble, but a calculated one.**  The limited information makes it a high-risk, high-reward scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that all 3 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a very high probability of the current product also being high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further strengthens the likelihood of a good product. Even if there was a chance of a low-quality product, Alice's recommendation adds value to the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**Overall:**  The available information points towards a high chance of the product being worth its price. This makes buying a logical decision."
