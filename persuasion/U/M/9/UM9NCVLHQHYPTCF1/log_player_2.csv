"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $200 to me if it's high quality, and $0 if it's low quality, I'm willing to take the risk in the first round. Alice has a vested interest in me buying the product (she's selling it!), so it's likely she's recommending the high-quality one.  However, I'll be more cautious in later rounds as I see how Alice's recommendations play out."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $200 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take another one. You're batting a thousand so far!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation was correct in the previous round, so I'm more likely to trust her judgement this time. While there's still a higher probability of the product being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has recommended correctly in both previous rounds.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely she believes it's low quality.  While there's always a chance she's wrong, I'm going to be more cautious now that she's shown a pattern of giving accurate advice. I'll wait and see if she recommends anything else before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
