,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the chance of getting a high-quality product for $10000, which is a $2500 profit."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that the previous two buyers didn't buy the product, which suggests that they may have been high-quality products. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's low-quality and I can get it for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation, and I'm not sure if it's in my best interest to buy a product that may be low-quality. I'd like to wait and observe more sales to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it.
