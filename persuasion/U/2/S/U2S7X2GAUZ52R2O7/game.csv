low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no prior data to go on."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended a high-quality product to the previous buyer, which makes me skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous buyer was also recommended to buy, but the product was low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know Alice knows the true value of the product, and her recommendation is likely influenced by her knowledge of my valuation. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might make her think the product is low quality. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance with the next product.

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share that with me?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm concerned that she may be trying to sell a low-quality product to me. I'd rather wait and observe more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
