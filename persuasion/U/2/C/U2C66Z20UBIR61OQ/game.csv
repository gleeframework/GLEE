,,Alice,1,"Greetings! I am offering a unique product for $1000000. While I cannot disclose its exact nature, I can assure you it has the potential to be incredibly valuable. It's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality, worth $2000000 to you, or low-quality, worth nothing. I'm confident in this product's potential, and I believe it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, I'm hesitant to make a purchase without any information about its quality.

Do you want to be the first to take a chance on this product and potentially be rewarded greatly?",
