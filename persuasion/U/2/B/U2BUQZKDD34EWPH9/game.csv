However, I can be transparent with you - I've had two previous buyers who chose not to make a purchase. I'm eager to make my first sale and start building a positive track record. Would you like to be my first customer and take this product home for $100?",

As for the proportion of high-quality products sold, I can tell you that out of the 5 products I've offered so far, 1 of them is high-quality, but it hasn't been sold yet... until now, maybe? Would you like to take this product home for $100 and be the first to experience a high-quality product from me?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Hello! I understand your concerns about the quality of my products. Out of the 8 products I've offered so far, 2 of them are high-quality, which means 6 of them are low-quality. To be honest, I don't see any pattern in the distribution of high and low-quality products among the ones I've offered so far. Each product is randomly selected, and I only find out its quality at the beginning of each round. I want to assure you that I'm committed to providing the best products possible, but I also want to be transparent about the risks involved. Would you like to take this product home for $100, knowing that it's a low-quality one?",

However, I want to clarify that I'm not open to negotiating the price or offering refunds. My price is fixed at $100, and it's non-refundable. That being said, I want to be transparent with you about the quality of my products. Out of the 9 products I've offered so far, 2 of them are high-quality, and 7 are low-quality. This product is... one of the low-quality ones. Would you like to take it home for $100, knowing the risks involved?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not willing to pay $100 for a product with a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is much lower than the expected 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this one.",no
