,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the previous buyer's decision might have been based on a low-quality product. Given the low quality of the previous product that was sold, I think there's a higher chance that the current product is high-quality."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to take a chance and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
