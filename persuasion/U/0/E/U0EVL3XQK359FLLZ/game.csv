,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to rely on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of the first buyer purchased the product, and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer having bought a product and no high-quality products sold yet, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%), suggesting that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
