high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product so far. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, and I've already sold one high-quality product out of two total sales.",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the next one will be high-quality as well.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's clear that my sales record is biased towards high-quality products.

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, it's clear that my sales record is strongly biased towards high-quality products. In fact, the probability of the next product being low-quality is now 10%. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $100, but I want to ask: are you willing to take a chance on a product with a 10% chance of being low-quality?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low probability of it being low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product, hoping the probability of it being low-quality is even lower.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. You've seen the trend, and I'll be transparent: I'm not going to try to sell you a low-quality product. I'll sell you this one for $100, but I'll give you a heads up: I've already sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next product being low-quality is extremely low. If you're willing to take a chance on a product that's almost certainly high-quality, I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",
