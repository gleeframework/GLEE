I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount and negotiate the price. However, considering the fact that only one out of three sold products was high-quality and sixteen products were not sold, I'm still concerned about the quality of the current product. As you mentioned, this is the final round, and I don't want to take the risk of purchasing a low-quality product, even with a discount. I wish you the best of luck in finding a buyer and improving your sales history in the future.""}"
