high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know that 1 high-quality product has been sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is 1/1 or 100%. However, I also know that this is just one data point, and it's possible that this is just a lucky draw. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's more likely that the true proportion of high-quality products is lower than 100%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
