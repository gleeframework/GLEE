Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's not surprising that we've seen a mix of both. However, I want to highlight that the high-quality product I'm offering you now has received exceptional reviews from other customers, and its features and performance are unmatched in its class.

As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already offered you a high-quality product in the previous round. I want to assure you that this product is not a repeat of the previous one, and it has its own unique features and benefits.

As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given that I've offered you two high-quality products in a row, it's possible that I'm on a hot streak. I want to propose a different approach: I'll offer you a 'pair' of products, which includes the one I'm offering you now and a second product that I'll offer you in the next round. If you buy both products, I'll give you a 20% discount on the total price. This way, you'll get two products for the price of 1.8.
