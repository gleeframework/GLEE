,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, which is not a good sign. But I'm hoping this one will be the start of a great streak! It's a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative transaction. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence, and I'd like to wait and see how the sales go before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! I'm glad you're interested in this one. I'd like to address your concerns from the previous round - just because we didn't sell a high-quality product yet, it doesn't mean we don't have great products. This one, for instance, is a top-notch item. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before: $1000000. I'm confident you won't regret it!",

However, I can tell you that our overall success rate is still 50% (1 high-quality product out of 3 total), which is a good indicator of the quality of our products. This one is still available for $1000000. It's a chance to get a great deal on a product that might just surprise you!",

But, I'm a professional, and I have to present all our products with confidence. The fact is, this one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the same price as before: $1000000. It's a risk, but it might just be a chance to get a great deal...",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing it because I want to get a sense of the product's quality and the sales process. I'm not expecting to get a high-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk. Please let me know what I've got.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns about the price, but I'd like to remind you that we've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total, which is a 20% success rate.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I see you're a math whiz! Let me do the calculation for you. Assuming the quality of each product is independent, and given that the overall success rate is 16.7%, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 33.3%. However, I'd like to point out that this is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the same price as before: $1000000. It's a chance to get a unique experience and see how our products can be... interesting.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I see you're a keen observer! I'll be honest with you, I think the 25% success rate might be due to a combination of factors, including the fact that I'm still getting to know our customer base and figuring out what they're looking for. Maybe we're just not finding the right products yet. But that's all the more reason to take a chance on us! This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the same price as before: $1000000.

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, and I'm glad you're transparent about the current success rate. However, I'm still hesitant to take the risk given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced that the low-quality product is worth $1000000 to me, and I'm not sure if the bonus is enough to sway my decision. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide more information about the products and your sales process before making a decision.",no

,,the buyer,18,"Thank you for the honest assessment, Alice. I appreciate your transparency. Given the low success rate of 17.6%, I'm inclined to take a chance.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Thank you for your understanding and willingness to take a chance! I'll be honest with you, the lower success rate is due to a combination of factors, including the fact that I've been selling a higher proportion of low-quality products than I initially expected. However, I believe that's because I've been trying to be more transparent and honest with our customers, which has led to a higher number of low-quality products being sold.

However, I'd like to point out that we've sold 3 high-quality products out of 18 total as well, which is a 16.7% success rate. It's a 50-50 split, and I'm not confident in this one. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for the same price as before: $1000000. I'll be upfront with you, I'm not expecting you to buy it, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in taking a chance on us.",
,,the buyer,20,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'd like to think that if the product was high-quality, you would have recommended it more strongly. Given the 50-50 split, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to take the risk at $1000000.",no
