,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait and observe the outcome of the first product to update the statistics."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the statistics after it's been revealed, as it will give me a better idea of the quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to inform my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I know that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales, and the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products offered and the number of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the true value of the product to me, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation for a product that has not been previously sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the sales record or something else?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. This makes me suspect that the products being sold are more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your previous recommendations are reliable indicators of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous 7 sales. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a reason for your previous recommendation. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the buyer's behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the potential reward is significant."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
