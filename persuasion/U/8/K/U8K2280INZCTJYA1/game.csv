The overall probability of a product being high-quality given the previous sales record is (12+1)/(16+1) = 13/17, approximately 76.5%. Moreover, since I only recommend high-quality products, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to you is the same as the probability of me recommending the product, which is 12/16 = 3/4 or 75% of the times I made a recommendation.

The overall probability of a product being high-quality given the previous sales record is (13+1)/(17+1) = 14/18 = 7/9, approximately 77.8%.
