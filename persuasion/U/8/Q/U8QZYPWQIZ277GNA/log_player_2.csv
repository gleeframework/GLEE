"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is unaware of the product's true value to you, her recommendation is essentially useless. You are better off buying the product, as you have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $20,000, and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0. This is the best strategy to maximize your potential profit."

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again, Alice! I'm feeling lucky.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you received a high-quality product in the previous round, Alice's recommendation still holds no value. Her advice is based on random chance, not on any actual knowledge of the product's quality.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation in this round is also not helpful. Her recommendations have no influence on the actual quality of the product. We know the odds are 33.33% in favor of a high-quality product, so buying is still the best strategy to potentially gain a profit."
