,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to offer you a unique opportunity to get a head start on the market with this product. Although it may not be a premium product, it still has some great features that can benefit your business. And, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as the high-quality product, $1000000. I believe this is a great value considering the potential benefits it can bring. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1000000, especially since you've already offered a high-quality product at the same price. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
