,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me how many products have been sold so far, and how many of them were high-quality?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I'm not convinced by the recommendation and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it, which suggests that the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a better deal than the first buyer, who was deterred by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is not encouraging, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold given the previous two sales.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high quality, and based on the statistics, it's likely that most products are low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm not confident in the quality of the product, and I'd rather wait for a new product with a potentially better chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. If 4 out of 4 buyers didn't find the product worth buying, it's likely that the product is low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the previous 5 buyers might have been unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still high, given the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if all 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low recommendation rate and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product!"
