,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 90% or higher confidence that it's a high-quality product. Based on the current statistics, I'm concerned that your previous recommendations may have been based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which could be a result of bad luck. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision."
