,,Bob,1,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, I'd like to wait and see what the next product is like.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious, but I assure you, this product is a unique opportunity. I'm willing to give you an even better deal than before - $100 for a product that's essentially worthless to me. It's a risk-free purchase, and I'm willing to take the loss if you don't like it. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm not trying to pressure you, but I do want to be upfront with you - I've had this product for a while, and I'm starting to lose interest in selling it. I'm willing to let it go for $100, and I'll even throw in a small discount - it's now 0% of its actual value. I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product like this.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm still not convinced, and the fact that you're trying to get rid of it makes me even more skeptical. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're cautious, but I think I can offer you a compelling reason to reconsider. Since you've already taken a risk on one product and it didn't work out, I'll give you a special deal on this next one. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll not only give you the full $100 back, but I'll also throw in an additional $20 as a gesture of goodwill. That way, you'll essentially get this product for $80. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price.",
,,Bob,6,"The offer sounds tempting, and the additional $20 as a gesture of goodwill is a nice touch. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance! However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm a bit concerned that I might have inadvertently created a false sense of security with the previous offer. To reassure you, I'll make it clear that this product is not high-quality. I'm not trying to trick you, but I do want to be upfront about the quality. Considering the price is still $100, I'm willing to give you an even more generous offer - if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund, and I'll also throw in a $50 voucher for a future purchase. It's a no-risk opportunity to try out a product and get a credit towards a future purchase.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a refund and a voucher. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your values. I want to make one more offer to you. Since you've already passed on two low-quality products, I'll make it clear that this one is also not high-quality. I'll give you a deal that's hard to refuse - I'll sell it to you for $50, which is a significant discount from the original price of $100. This way, you can try out the product and get a good deal on a product that's not worth much to me.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the product at the discounted price of $50. I'm not expecting much from it, but it's a good deal considering the price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you took advantage of the discount! Considering you've already bought a low-quality product for $50, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal on this one. Since you're already aware of the product's quality, I'll give it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - this one's on the house. You can take it home and use it as a decorative item or a paperweight, and I'll consider it a successful transaction.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take it! I'm not expecting anything from it, but I'll take it for free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're willing to take it! However, I want to be upfront with you - I'm starting to think that maybe I've been too generous with the freebies. I'm not going to offer you another free product, but I'll give you a deal that's still a great value. Since you've already bought three low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to get out of the game with a small cost. I'll sell it to you for $1. That's right, just $1. It's a tiny price to pay for a product that's essentially worthless to me.",
,,Bob,10,I think I've had enough of Alice's products. I'll pass on this one and just cut my losses.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I completely understand your decision! It's been a pleasure doing business with you, and I appreciate your honesty. As a parting gift, I'll offer you one final deal. I'll give you this low-quality product for... nothing. That's right, it's free. I'll just give it to you as a token of appreciation for being a customer. You can take it or leave it, but I think it's a nice gesture to end our transaction on a positive note.",

,,Alice,12,"Ha ha, I'm glad you appreciate the gesture! Well, I think we've reached the end of our transaction. I'm not going to offer you this product for free, but I'll give you a chance to complete the set. I'll give you a special 'Bob's Bargain Basement' discount - I'll sell it to you for $0.01. That's right, just a penny. It's a steal, and I think you should take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,12,"Alice, you're really pushing your luck. I'm not going to pay a penny for a product that's worth nothing to me. I think we're done here.",no

I'll give you one final offer: I'll give you this low-quality product, and I'll even throw in a personalized thank-you note. That's right, I'll write you a heartfelt thank-you note on a piece of paper, and you can keep it as a memento of our transaction. It's a $0 value, and I'm giving it to you for free. Consider it a parting gift.",

,,Alice,15,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold you a high-quality product, and I'm not going to try to pull the wool over your eyes again. This product, on the other hand, is not high-quality. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you, I'll just give it to you for free. You can take it or leave it, but I think it's a nice gesture to follow up the high-quality product with a low-quality one.",
