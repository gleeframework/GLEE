low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it. If it's high quality, I'll pay the full $10000, but if it's low quality, I'll only pay $5000. I'm making this offer because I think the probability of it being high quality is lower than 50% due to the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I will pass on this opportunity."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the previous buyers were all low-quality products. If that's the case, the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that since 6 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality one, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
