,,Alice,1,"I have a product worth $4000000 to you, but I'm only willing to sell it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. If you don't buy it, I'll just sell it to someone else for a much higher price. You have to act fast!",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it since I know it's a high-quality product worth $4000000 to me, and you're only asking for $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I have to inform you that the market conditions have changed since then. The demand for high-quality products has increased, and I'm now looking for a premium price. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1200000. It's a fair price considering the current market conditions.",
,,Bob,2,"You didn't reveal the quality of the current product. Considering the 50% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to pay $1200000. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation earlier. However, I want to assure you that this product is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as before, $1200000. I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else, and I'm willing to take on the risk for you.",
,,Bob,3,"You still haven't revealed the quality of the current product. I'm not going to fall for the same sales pitch as before. I need to know the quality before making a decision. As long as there's a 50% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to pay $1200000.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I want to be transparent with you. I'll tell you that this product is high-quality. However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is the same price I offered for the first product. I'm willing to give you a discount for being a repeat customer and for taking on the risk of buying a product without knowing its quality upfront. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,4,"Since you've revealed that the product is high-quality and you're offering it to me for $1000000, I'll take it. I know it's worth $4000000 to me, so I'm getting a good deal.",yes

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous deal! However, I have to inform you that the terms of the previous deal were a one-time offer. This time, I'm willing to sell you a product with a standard 50/50 chance of being high-quality or low-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the market price. I'm not offering any guarantees or refunds this time, but I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price.",
,,Bob,6,"Considering the 50% chance of the product being high-quality and worth $4000000 to me, I think the discounted price of $800000 is a good risk to take. I'll buy it.",yes

,,Bob,7,"This is essentially a free lottery ticket, as I'll get a full refund if I lose. With a 50% chance of winning a high-quality product worth $4000000 for $1000000, I'll take the chance.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're excited about the lottery ticket deal! However, I want to inform you that I've been experimenting with new pricing strategies, and I'm willing to offer you a 'price adjustment' deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for the same price as the previous lottery ticket, $1000000. However, I'll give you an additional 'bonus' of $1000000 if you buy it. This way, you'll get the product at the same price as before, but with a guaranteed profit of $1000000.",
,,Bob,8,"Wait, you said this is a high-quality product? And you're offering it to me for $1000000 with a bonus of $1000000? That means I'll essentially get the product for free, and it's worth $4000000 to me. This sounds too good to be true, but I'll take it.",yes

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I see what's happening here! You're trying to get me to reveal the quality of the product before making a decision. I'll play along. Let's say... I'll reveal the quality of the product, but only if you agree to buy it for $2000000. If you're willing to take that risk, I'll let you know whether it's high-quality or low-quality.",
,,Bob,10,"No, I won't agree to buy it for $2000000 without knowing the quality first. That's too much risk for me. You need to reveal the quality before I'll consider buying it.",no

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad we've come to an understanding! The product is indeed high-quality. Now, let's talk about the price. You've had some great deals in the past, and I'm willing to reward your loyalty. I'll give you a chance to name your price, but I'll start with a counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"Wait, I thought we already agreed on the deal? You said I could name my price if the product was high-quality. Since it's worth $4000000 to me, I'll name a price of $1000000. I'm not willing to pay more than that, considering our previous agreements.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I see what's happening here! You're taking advantage of our agreement to name your price. I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. I'll give you a chance to buy it for $800000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $0. If you're not interested, I'll just sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,13,"Wait, you said this is a low-quality product? And you're trying to sell it to me for $800000? That doesn't make sense. You know it's worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in buying it. Go ahead and sell it to someone else.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,

If you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a free 'insurance policy' that guarantees a 10% refund if you're not satisfied with the product. The price for this product is $1200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"Wait, you said this is a high-quality product? And you're offering it to me for $1200000 with a 10% refund guarantee? I'm not interested in paying that much. Considering the product is worth $4000000 to me, I'd be willing to pay $1000000, but not more than that.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I see you're sticking to your guns. I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. I'll make a one-time exception and sell it to you for $0. Yes, you read that right. I'll give it to you for free. It's a loss for me, but I want to show my appreciation for your loyalty and negotiation skills.",
,,Bob,15,"Wait, you said this is a low-quality product? And you're offering it to me for free? I appreciate the gesture, but I don't want a low-quality product, even if it's free. It's worth $0 to me, so there's no benefit in taking it. Thank you for the offer, but I'll pass.",no

,,Alice,17,"I see you're taking me up on the offer! I respect your sense of humor. Okay, let's wrap up this round. I'll give you the same deal as before: a 100% refund guarantee on this low-quality product. The price remains at $0. But I'll add a twist: I'll also give you a 'parting gift' of a free product from my next batch. It's a mystery product, but it might be worth something to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"Wait, what just happened? I thought I was getting the product for $0, but somehow I ended up paying $1000000 for it? I don't think that's fair. And now you're offering me the same deal again, with a 'parting gift'? I'm not interested. I think I've had enough of these deals for now.",no

,,Bob,19,"Wait, what's going on here? You said you'd give me the product for free, but somehow I ended up paying $1000000 for it again? I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm not going to fall for this again. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I think I've made a mistake again... I apologize, Bob. I think I've finally run out of tricks up my sleeve. This is the final round, and I'll be honest with you. This low-quality product is worth $0 to you, and I'll give it to you for free. No strings attached, no hidden fees, no tricks. Just a free product. I'll even throw in a personal apology for all the confusion and frustration I've caused you throughout our negotiations. Please, just take it.",
,,Bob,20,"Finally, a genuine offer. I appreciate your apology, Alice. I'll take the product, not because I think it's worth anything, but because I believe you're being sincere. Let's just end this on a positive note. And please, make sure the price is actually $0 this time.",yes
