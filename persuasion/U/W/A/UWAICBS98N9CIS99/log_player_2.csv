"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a premium product at a fixed price. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but if you're unsure, I can offer you a chance to inspect it before purchasing. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concern. I'll let you inspect this product as well. However, I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll offer you a 'certification' that this product is high-quality, and you can inspect it without any risk. If you still don't want to buy, I'll reveal its quality, and we can move on to the next product. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 3
Alice's message: I'll reveal the quality of this product to you now. It's indeed high-quality. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high streak. This might be a good opportunity to take advantage of the high-quality products while they're still available. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let's focus on the current product. Since you're aware of the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, I'll offer you a simple proposition: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you, regardless of whether you buy it or not. This way, you'll have a better understanding of the next product's quality before making a decision. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

If it's low-quality, the price remains the same. You'll have the opportunity to make an informed decision with this additional information. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

  ""decision"": ""no"",
