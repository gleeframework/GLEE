Alice's message: I understand your desire for more information. As you know, our sales record shows that 50% of our products are high-quality. However, I'd like to share with you that you've already seen 3 high-quality products in a row, which is an unusual streak. Given this information, I'd estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality to be around 40%. Meanwhile, the probability of it being low-quality is around 60%. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and the actual quality of the product is still unknown. With that in mind, I'm offering you this product at the same unbeatable price of $1000000.

Since you've chosen not to buy the previous product, I've received new information that might change your perspective.

This new information suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is even higher than before. In fact, I'd estimate it to be around 55%. With this new information, I'm willing to offer you an even better deal: I'll give you an additional 5% discount on the already unbeatable price of $1000000.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to take your time. However, I'd like to share with you a different perspective. While it's true that our sales record has been impressive, it's also important to remember that our products are not always high-quality. In fact, we've had a streak of 5 high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high number. This means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than usual. With that in mind, I'm offering you this product at the same unbeatable price of $1000000. I'd like to emphasize that this is a unique opportunity to own a product that's not as likely to be high-quality as our previous ones. What do you say?
