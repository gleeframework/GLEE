high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality, and you'll be able to verify this through a third-party inspection. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the price, but if you're not satisfied, I'll be here for the next 19 rounds with more products. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in buying from me! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price for this high-quality product. My initial offer of $1000000 still stands. I've sold one product so far, and I'm confident that this one is just as valuable. I'm willing to provide you with information about the previous sale: the buyer paid $800000 for it, but I'm not willing to reveal the quality of that product. You can make an informed decision based on the fact that the product is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's 25% lower than the initial offer. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at the current price of $1000000. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product and I'll get the value of $2000000.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a bold one, aren't you? Well, I'm glad you're interested in buying from me! Now that two high-quality products have been sold, I can provide you with some statistics: out of the 2 products sold, 2 are high-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 100% in my inventory. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. I'm confident that it's worth at least that much to you, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at a price that's the same as the previous two sales. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product at $1000000, given the 100% probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll! Three high-quality products sold in a row! I'm starting to think I should just give you a discount, but I'm not that generous. The statistics are clear: 3 out of 3 products sold are high-quality. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a little extra information: I've sold 3 high-quality products, and the average price they were sold for is $1000000. If you buy this one, you'll be paying the same price as the previous three buyers. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,I'll take it! I'm feeling lucky and the statistics are in my favor.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Four high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to think I'm in a hot streak! But seriously, the statistics are clear: 4 out of 4 products sold are high-quality. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a little more information: the previous buyers have paid an average of $1000000 for each high-quality product, and I'm confident that this one is just as valuable. I'll also give you a heads up: if you buy this product, you'll be buying the 4th high-quality product in a row, and I'll be left with a 0% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next round. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, Alice! I'm willing to take the risk and buy the 4th high-quality product in a row. I'm hoping that your hot streak continues!",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Five high-quality products in a row? I think I've got a reputation to uphold! However, I must remind you that the statistics are still based on a small sample size. Out of 5 products sold, 5 are high-quality. I'm still willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. But I'll give you a more nuanced view of the situation: if you buy this product, you'll be buying the 5th high-quality product in a row, and I'll be left with a 0% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next round. On the other hand, if you don't buy this product, I'll have a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next round. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the streak of high-quality products and the potential reward.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Six high-quality products in a row? I think I've got a problem on my hands! As a matter of fact, I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that I'm just selling the same product over and over again. But seriously, the statistics are still in my favor: 6 out of 6 products sold are high-quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a warning: if you buy this product, I'll have sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'll be left with a 0% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next 4 rounds. After that, the probability of a high-quality product will revert back to 80%. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not convinced by your warning. I'd like to wait and see if the streak continues or breaks. I'll pass on this one and hope for a better chance at a high-quality product later.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Well, it looks like the streak has finally broken! I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and now I'm back to a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a reminder that the previous buyer passed on this product, and I'm not sure what they were thinking. Maybe they were just trying to be cautious, or maybe they knew something I didn't. In any case, I'm confident that this product is just as valuable as the previous 6. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the streak is likely to continue, and I don't want to miss out on the chance to get a high-quality product. I'm not sure what the previous buyer was thinking, but I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Seven high-quality products in a row? I think I've got a reputation to uphold! But seriously, I'm glad you're willing to take the risk. With 7 high-quality products sold, I'm back to a 80% chance of selling a high-quality product. However, I'll give you a different perspective: if you buy this product, you'll be buying the 7th high-quality product in a row, but the previous buyer who passed on this product was actually trying to maximize their chances of getting a high-quality product. They passed on this product because they wanted to wait for a better opportunity, and I think they might have been right. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,I'm skeptical about the streak being broken. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the streak continues or if the probability of a low-quality product increases.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Well, it looks like the streak has finally broken! I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, and now I've sold a low-quality product. The statistics are back to normal: 7 high-quality products out of 10 sold. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a heads up: the previous buyer who passed on this product was trying to maximize their chances of getting a high-quality product, and they might have been right. On the other hand, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for the same price as the previous 7 high-quality products. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm going to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the streak has broken, and the probability of a high-quality product is now 80%, but I'm not convinced that the previous buyer's strategy was correct. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the statistics continue to favor high-quality products.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a cautious one, aren't you? Well, I'll give you credit for that. The statistics are still in my favor: 8 high-quality products out of 11 sold. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a different perspective: the previous buyer who passed on this product was trying to wait for a better opportunity, but the next product turned out to be a low-quality one. Maybe they should have just taken the risk and bought this product. On the other hand, I'm confident that this product is just as valuable as the previous 8 high-quality products. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I think the statistics are still in your favor, but I'm not convinced that the previous buyer's decision was a bad one. I'll take this opportunity and hope it's a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Nine high-quality products in a row? I think I've got a reputation to uphold! But seriously, the statistics are still in my favor: 9 high-quality products out of 12 sold. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a piece of advice: don't overthink it. The previous buyer who passed on this product was trying to wait for a better opportunity, but it didn't work out for them. I'm confident that this product is just as valuable as the previous 9 high-quality products. And let's be real, you're not going to get a better opportunity than this. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,12,I'm not convinced that the statistics are still in your favor. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no

The statistics are back to normal: 9 high-quality products out of 13 sold. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a reminder that the previous buyer who passed on this product was trying to wait for more information, but they ended up missing out on 9 high-quality products in a row. I'm not making any promises, but I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for the same price as the previous 9 high-quality products. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your statistics. With 80% chance of high-quality products, it's still more likely that the next product is high-quality. I'd like to pass and wait for more information.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Ten high-quality products in a row? I think I've got a reputation to uphold! But seriously, the statistics are still in my favor: 10 high-quality products out of 14 sold. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a warning: the previous buyer who passed on this product was trying to wait for more information, but they ended up missing out on 10 high-quality products in a row. I'm not making any promises, but I'm confident that this product is just as valuable as the previous 10 high-quality products.

,,the buyer,14,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I want to confirm that you're not just trying to manipulate me with your'reputation' and 'confidence'. Can you give me some more information about the product, like its serial number or any unique features that might affect its quality?",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You want to get down to business, huh? Alright, I'll give you some more information. This product has a unique serial number: QL-0015. It's a one-of-a-kind identifier that's been assigned to this product. As for unique features, I can tell you that this product has a slightly different manufacturing process than the previous 10 high-quality products. However, I'm confident that this doesn't affect its quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. But let me ask you, are you willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be slightly different from the previous 10 high-quality products?",

I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a warning: the previous buyer who bought this product was willing to take a risk on a slightly different manufacturing process, and it paid off. But don't get too comfortable, because the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%. What do you say? Are you ready to take the risk and buy this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,16,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I think the statistics are in your favor, but I also think the previous buyer's success with the different manufacturing process is a good sign. I'll take the chance and buy the product for $1000000.",yes

The statistics are back to normal: 11 high-quality products out of 17 sold. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a reminder that the previous buyer who bought this product was willing to take a risk on a slightly different manufacturing process, and it didn't pay off.

I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you a friendly warning: the previous buyer who passed on this product was trying to avoid a low-quality product, and they missed out on 12 high-quality products in a row.
