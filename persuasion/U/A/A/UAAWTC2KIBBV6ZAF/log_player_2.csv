Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in buying from me! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to negotiate the price for this high-quality product. My initial offer of $1000000 still stands. I've sold one product so far, and I'm confident that this one is just as valuable. I'm willing to provide you with information about the previous sale: the buyer paid $800000 for it, but I'm not willing to reveal the quality of that product.

But seriously, the statistics are still in my favor: 6 out of 6 products sold are high-quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a warning: if you buy this product, I'll have sold 6 high-quality products in a row, and I'll be left with a 0% chance of selling a high-quality product in the next 4 rounds.
