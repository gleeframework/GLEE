,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I know it's a 50/50 chance, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product was low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. I'm not willing to take the risk at this point."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer passed. I'm hoping that the product is high quality since the first buyer didn't buy it."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%.

I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
