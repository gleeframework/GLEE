Will you take advantage of this offer?",

If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice, worth up to $500000. The price remains the same, $1000000. This is a unique opportunity to take advantage of a premium product with a safety net. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. I'd still be paying $1000000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this offer as well.",no

That's a significant discount, and I'm only willing to do this because I value our relationship and I want to make a deal. What do you think?",
