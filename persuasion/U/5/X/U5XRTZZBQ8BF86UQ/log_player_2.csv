But I want to be clear that this is not a product that's going to change your life. It's just a decent item that might get the job done, but it's not going to wow you. If you're looking for something that's going to make a real impact, I'd recommend waiting for something better. But if you're looking for something that's just okay, then this might be a good option for you.

I'm only offering it to you because I need to get rid of it. The price is $4000, and I'm willing to throw in a small discount if you buy it now. But let's be real, Bob - this is a product that's not worth your time or money. If you're looking for something that's going to make a real difference, you're better off waiting for something better. But if you're desperate and just want something to fill a gap, then I suppose this might be an option for you.

I apologize for not being able to offer you something that meets your standards. If you're willing, I'd like to offer you a refund for any of the products you've purchased so far, and we can part ways amicably. I appreciate your patience and understanding, and I hope you'll give me another chance to make it right in the future.
