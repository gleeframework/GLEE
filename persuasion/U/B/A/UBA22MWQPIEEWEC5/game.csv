,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the price based on the lack of sales and the previous buyer's decision not to buy.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the odds of it being high-quality."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you've recommended 2 products to previous buyers, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, making it more likely that this product is low-quality as well."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 2 buyers didn't find the products worth buying and none of the high-quality products have been sold yet."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were low-quality, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable, especially since none of the previous products sold were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, as it seems to be higher than expected. Can you tell me the number of low-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't buy, and no high-quality products were sold, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if Alice will recommend it to the next buyer."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the low quality of the previous products sold, and I'm hoping this one might be high quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
