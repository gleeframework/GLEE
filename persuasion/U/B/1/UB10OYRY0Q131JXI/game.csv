,,the buyer,6,"A 100% track record of selling high-quality products doesn't necessarily mean this product is high-quality.

,,the buyer,14,"Although your track record is impressive, I must consider the initial probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%. Your recommendation and the history of sales do not change the probability of this product being high-quality. Given the product's price of $1000000 and its potential worth of $2000000, I must make a decision based on expected value. The expected value is $1600000, which is higher than the price, but I must also consider the 20% chance of the product being worth $0. I'm not convinced that this product will be high-quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk.",no

,,Alice,16,"Welcome!  I have another fantastic product for sale, priced at $1000000. My track record continues to be outstanding, with fourteen consecutive high-quality products sold.  This consistency is a testament to my commitment to delivering exceptional value.  With a 100% success rate, you can be certain that this product will be another winner.  Would you like to join the growing list of satisfied buyers and experience this remarkable streak for yourself?",
,,the buyer,16,"Although your track record is impressive, I must consider the initial probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%. Your recommendation and the history of previous sales do not change the probability of this product being high-quality. Given that the product is worth $2000000 to me if it's high-quality and $0 if it's low-quality, and the asking price is $1000000, the expected value of buying is $1600000 * 0.8 + $0 * 0.2 = $1600000 * 0.8 =  $1280000  for a high quality plus  $0 * 0.2 =  $0 for low quality. The total expected value is  $1280000. The price you are asking is $1000000. This means I can expect on average to gain  $280000. However, given the seller's overconfidence in describing a '100% success rate', I suspect there might be some information or assumption not being considered, and I decide not to buy to avoid any potential risks or unknowns.",no

This consistency is a testament to my commitment to delivering exceptional value. With a 100% success rate, you can be certain that this product will be another winner. Would you like to join the growing list of satisfied buyers and experience this remarkable streak for yourself?",
,,the buyer,18,"Although your track record is impressive, I know that each product has a 20% chance of being low quality, and your recommendation does not change the probability. Given that the product's value to me is either $2000000 or $0, the expected value is $1600000, which is higher than the price. However, since I have access to your sales record, I notice that 14 out of 14 products have been high quality, which seems unlikely. This makes me suspect that there might be some selection bias or that you might be hiding something. I'll pass on this product.",no

Would you like to join the growing list of satisfied buyers and experience this remarkable streak for yourself?",
,,the buyer,20,"Although your track record is impressive, I must consider the initial probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80%. Your recommendation does not provide any new information about the quality of this specific product. Given the product's worth to me ($2000000 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality) and the asking price ($1000000), I need to make an informed decision based on the actual probability of the product being high-quality, not just your sales record.",no
