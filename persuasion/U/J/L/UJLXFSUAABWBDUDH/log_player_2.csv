**Explanation:**

The buyer has access to the following information:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product.
* **Previous sales data:** 1 buyer purchased a product, and it was high quality.

Since the product is recommended and the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, the probability of the current product being high quality is likely higher than the 80% base probability. 

Therefore, it is beneficial to purchase the product."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation Alice, I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The data shows a 100% success rate for buyers who have followed Alice's recommendations (2 high-quality products out of 2 sales).
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to maximize her profits by selling more products.  She is likely to be recommending products she believes are of high quality to increase her chances of a sale.

**Risk vs. Reward:**

While there's still a 20% chance the product is low-quality, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
