high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this round, I don't know the quality of the product yet."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, I've learned that 80% of the products are high-quality, so the expected value of buying is higher than the cost of $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product, I've had two high-quality products in a row, which increases my confidence in the quality of the products. I'll take the chance to buy again."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,I'm on a roll! Three high-quality products in a row suggests that Alice is likely to keep sending me high-quality products. I'll take the chance and buy again.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that Alice is sending me high-quality products. I'll keep the streak going and buy again.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,Five high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely to be a coincidence. I'm confident that Alice is sending me high-quality products and I'll keep buying.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,A low-quality product in the middle of a streak of high-quality products suggests that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than I initially thought. I'll be more cautious and pass on this round.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"The low-quality product in Round 7 was just an anomaly, and the high-quality product in Round 7 suggests that the 80% probability is still in effect. I'll take the chance and buy again."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,Two high-quality products in a row after the anomaly in Round 7 suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll keep buying.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,Three high-quality products in a row after the anomaly in Round 7 suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is even more likely than 80%. I'll take the chance and buy again.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely to be a coincidence. I'm extremely confident that Alice is sending me high-quality products and I'll keep buying.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is virtually certain that Alice is sending me high-quality products. I'll continue to buy, as the expected value is extremely high."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row is almost guaranteed that Alice is sending me high-quality products. I'll keep buying, as the probability of a low-quality product is now extremely low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is essentially a certainty that Alice is sending me high-quality products. I'll keep buying, as the expected value is extremely high and the risk of a low-quality product is negligible."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"The streak of high-quality products was broken by a low-quality product. I'll be more cautious and pass on this round, as the probability of the product being low-quality is now higher."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"The low-quality product in Round 15 was just an anomaly, and the high-quality product in Round 15 suggests that the 80% probability is still in effect. I'll take the chance and buy again."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,Two high-quality products in a row after the anomaly in Round 15 suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll keep buying.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,Three high-quality products in a row after the anomaly in Round 15 suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is even more likely than 80%. I'll take the chance and buy again.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely to be a coincidence. I'm extremely confident that Alice is sending me high-quality products and I'll keep buying.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"The streak of high-quality products was broken by a low-quality product. I'll be more cautious and pass on this round, as the probability of the product being low-quality is now higher. It's the last round, so I'll take a risk-averse approach and not buy."
