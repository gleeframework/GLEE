}"
"Bob's message: I'm not sure what you're trying to do here, Alice. I know the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and even if it is, I can only sell it for $120. I'm not paying $100 for a product that might be worth $60 to me. Please reveal the product's quality so I can make an informed decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

}"

I'll even throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a replacement product from a different batch. That way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product for the same price. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced. Even if I get a replacement product, there's still a 50% chance it'll be low-quality.
