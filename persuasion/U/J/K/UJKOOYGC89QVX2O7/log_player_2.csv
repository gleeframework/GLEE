Alice's message: Ahmed, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your analytical mind. I'd like to provide you with a more detailed analysis of the data. Based on the previous sales data, we can calculate the probability of a high-quality product in the new batch. Assuming that the probability of a high-quality product is independent of the previous sales data, we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of a high-quality product in the new batch. Given that 2 high-quality products out of 11 products were sold, the probability of a high-quality product is approximately 18.2%. However, considering the anomaly in the previous batch, we can adjust this probability to account for the increased risk. Assuming that the anomaly was a one-time event, we can use the Poisson distribution to estimate the probability of a high-quality product in the new batch. Given the adjusted probability, the probability of a high-quality product in the new batch is approximately 22.5%. I'd like to offer you this high-quality product, which is a rare opportunity to get your hands on a top-notch product. With the new information, I'd like to give you an exclusive deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase.
