,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy and didn't purchase it, which might indicate a higher chance of low-quality products being sold."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 buyer having purchased and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
