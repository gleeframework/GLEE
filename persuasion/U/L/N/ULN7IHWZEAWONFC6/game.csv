low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or her previous sales record, but since 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received low-quality products (since no high-quality products were sold), I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80.00%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were low-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the products being recommended are low-quality. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is recommended or if the pattern continues."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data or a different recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than the average, and the probability of it being low quality is higher. I'd like to see the product go to the next buyer, who might have a different perspective."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm skeptical of the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product.
