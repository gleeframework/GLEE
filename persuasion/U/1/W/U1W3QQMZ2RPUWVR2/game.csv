,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Four high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to suspect that Alice is somehow influencing the quality of the products she recommends. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a more normal distribution.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,Five high-quality products in a row? This is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to think that Alice is cheating or has some kind of inside information. I'm not falling for it. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a low-quality product to balance things out.

,,Bob,15,yes,"I've been burned twice, but I've also had a chance to get a high-quality product twice in a row. I'll take the risk and buy this one, hoping to get lucky again."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,Nine high-quality products in a row? I'm starting to lose my mind. I'm going to assume that this is some kind of anomaly and pass on this one. I'll just take the $1000000 and call it a day.
