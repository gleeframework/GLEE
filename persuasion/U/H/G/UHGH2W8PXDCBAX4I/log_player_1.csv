"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer, considering the current statistics. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of a high-quality product is 2/3. However, since the next buyer will have access to this information, the probability of a high-quality product for the next buyer will be (2/3) / (2/3 + 1/3) = 2/3 / 1 = 2/3. But, since I don't know the quality of the current product, I need to consider the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, which is 80.00%. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, considering the current statistics. If I buy the product, I'll get a high-quality product with probability 80.00% and a low-quality product with probability 20.00%. If I pass on the product, the next buyer will have a 2/3 chance of getting a high-quality product. I'd like to know the expected value of buying the product versus passing on it.
