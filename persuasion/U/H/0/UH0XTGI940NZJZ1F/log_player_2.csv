"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for sale, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm taking a significant risk by selling it to you at this price, considering the product's value is unknown to me. I'm hoping you'll take the bait and make a fair offer.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500,000 for it, as I'm not sure of its quality and the asking price is significantly higher than its expected value to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've made an excellent decision in buying the first product, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. For this next product, I'd like to point out that you were willing to pay $500000 for a product of unknown quality, and now you've received a high-quality product. This suggests that the value of a high-quality product to you is at least $500000. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $750000, which is a fair price considering the value you've demonstrated for high-quality products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your analysis, but I'm not convinced that the value of a high-quality product to me is $750,000. In fact, I know that a high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to me. I'm willing to take the risk of buying another product, and I'd like to pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your honesty. Given that you're willing to take the risk of buying another product, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already demonstrated a willingness to pay $1250000 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $625000, which is a significant discount from the original price of $1000000. This way, you can still take advantage of a good deal, and I can clear some inventory.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I know it's worth $0 to me, and I'd rather wait for the next product.""}"

I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $937500, which is a compromise between the original price and the price you were willing to pay for a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $937,500 for a high-quality product. I know it's worth $1,250,000 to me, and I'd rather wait for the next product and potentially get it at a better price.""}"
