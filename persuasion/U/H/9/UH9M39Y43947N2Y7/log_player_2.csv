**Reasoning:**

* **High chance of high-quality:**  Even though the overall probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, Alice's recommendation, coupled with the fact that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, increases the likelihood that this product is also high-quality.  
* **Potential gain vs. loss:** If the product is high-quality, you'll gain $100. If it's low-quality, you lose $100. Given the increased probability of it being high-quality, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss.
* **Limited information:** While we don't know why Alice recommended the purchase, it's better to trust her judgment in this situation."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Sales Record:** 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold means a 100% success rate. This is significantly higher than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the product's true quality and is recommending you buy it. This strongly suggests the product is high quality.

Considering these factors, the risk of buying is very low, and the potential reward (a $200 value product for $100) is high. It's a good decision to buy."
