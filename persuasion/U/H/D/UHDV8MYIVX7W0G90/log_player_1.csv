Here's why:

* **Bob doesn't know the quality of the product.** He's basing his decision on Alice's recommendations, and she's been accurate so far.
* **Even with a low-quality product, Bob stands to lose only $100.** This is a calculated risk considering he's made $300 profit on the previous two purchases.
* **Maintaining trust is crucial.** If Alice starts recommending against low-quality products, Bob might become suspicious and stop buying altogether. 

Alice needs to build and maintain trust with Bob to maximize her potential profits. While selling a low-quality product might feel like a loss, it's essential for the long-term relationship."
