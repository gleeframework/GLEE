Alice's message: I see what's causing the confusion. I didn't mean to imply that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. What I meant to say is that the observed frequency of high-quality products sold so far (2 out of 5) is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%).
