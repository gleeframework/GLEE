**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point (1 high-quality product sold out of 1 buyer). This is not enough to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a clear incentive to recommend buying the product. She profits from every sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though the odds are against a high-quality product, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Strategy:** 
Since there is no way to assess the quality of the product based on the available data, the best approach is to trust Alice's recommendation. While the odds aren't in your favor, there's still a chance of getting a high-quality product, and the potential reward is worth the risk."
