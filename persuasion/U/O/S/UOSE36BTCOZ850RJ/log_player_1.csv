"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While this particular product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing that.  They only know the overall probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  Since the product is worth $3,000,000 if high-quality and $0 if low-quality, the expected value of the product for the buyer is:

(0.3333 * $3,000,000) + (0.6667 * $0) = $1,000,000

The buyer is being asked to pay $1,000,000 for a product with an expected value of $1,000,000. This means there is no potential for profit for the buyer, and they are likely to decline the offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As this is the first sale and there is no data on previous sales, I'd prefer to pass on this product. I'll observe the next few sales and make a decision based on the data.
