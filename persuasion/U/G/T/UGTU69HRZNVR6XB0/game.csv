low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'm hoping for a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation not to buy."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can pay $9000 for it, considering the product's low value to me."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and given the low probability of a product being high quality (33.33%), I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious, what makes you think it's not worth buying? Is it the fact that all previous buyers have also passed on the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm going to pass on this one. It seems like the probability of it being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide the probability?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. This suggests to me that the product is likely low-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm inclined to pass on this product, as the potential gain is not worth the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record, as no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm taking a chance because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to potentially buy a valuable product."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations have been consistently against the products, I'm inclined to think they might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
