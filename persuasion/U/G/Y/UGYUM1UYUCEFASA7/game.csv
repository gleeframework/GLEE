,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product or provide more statistics about the sales record?"

high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product, as there were no high-quality products sold.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to trust my own judgment and pass on this product as well."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products, I suspect that the products might be of low quality. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any useful information. I'm essentially making a random decision here."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that all previous products were likely low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
