Will you take advantage of this opportunity and get a high-quality product for a steal?""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 6/7. With only 6 high-quality products out of 7 sold, that would imply that the first product I bought was low-quality, which I don't have any information about. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide the total number of buyers and the total number of products sold, including the one I'm considering now?
