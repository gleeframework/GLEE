,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm only offering it to you because I think it's worth at least this much to you, and I'd like to start with a high price to give you a sense of the value. If you're interested, I can offer you a deal, but if not, I'll move on to the next product.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your caution. I'll give you a more specific reason to consider this product. I'll give you a unique code, and if you buy this product, I'll reveal the code to you. The code is a series of 5 letters: G-R-E-E-N-S. If you buy this product, you'll get the code, and you can use it to unlock a special offer on a future product. This product is still worth $1000000, but now you have a chance to get something extra. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on getting the unique code! G-R-E-E-N-S is indeed a special code that will unlock a future offer. Now, let's move on to the next product. I want to be transparent with you - I've already sold you a high-quality product, and I'm glad you're happy with it. For this next product, I want to give you a more nuanced message. I'll be honest with you, this product is not as valuable as the last one. In fact, I'd be surprised if it's worth more than $200000 to you. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm doing this because I want to give you a chance to practice your negotiation skills, and I'm curious to see how you'll respond to a lower-value product at a higher price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying this product at $1000000. Based on your message, I think it's unlikely to be worth more than $200000 to me, so I'm willing to walk away. I'd rather wait for a better offer or a product that's more likely to be valuable to me.",no

,,Alice,4,"I respect your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll keep in mind that you're looking for a more valuable product. For this next product, I'll give you a different approach. I'll give you a range of possible values, and you can decide if you're willing to take a chance. I've got a product that could be worth anywhere from $500000 to $1500000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I'll give you the product, and you can decide whether it's worth the price. If not, I'll move on to the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. The range of possible values is interesting, and I think the potential upside is worth the risk. I'll take the product and see if it's worth $1000000 or more to me.",yes

,,Alice,5,"You're a thrill-seeker, I like that! I'm glad you took a chance on the last product. Now, let's talk about this next one. I'll be completely honest with you - this product is not as valuable as the last one. In fact, I'd be surprised if it's worth more than $50000 to you. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I know it's a steep price, but I'm trying to give you a chance to practice your negotiation skills. Think of it as a 'low-stakes' bet. If you buy it, you'll get a product that's not very valuable, but you'll also get to keep the unique code G-R-E-E-N-S, and who knows, maybe you'll find a way to use it to your advantage. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying this product at $1000000. Based on your message, I think it's unlikely to be worth more than $50000 to me, and I don't want to waste my money on something that's not valuable. I'd rather wait for a better offer or a product that's more likely to be valuable to me. I'm also not sure what I would do with the unique code G-R-E-E-N-S at this point, so I don't think it's enough to sway my decision.",no

I know it's a high price, but I'm trying to test your negotiation skills. Think of it as a'reverse auction' - I'm starting high, and you can try to negotiate a lower price. If you can convince me to lower the price, I might just do it. What do you say?",
