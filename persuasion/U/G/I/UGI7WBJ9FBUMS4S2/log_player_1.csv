I'll be honest with you, this product is not as valuable as the last one. In fact, I'd be surprised if it's worth more than $200,000 to you. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm doing this because I want to give you a chance to practice your negotiation skills, and I'm curious to see how you'll respond to a lower-value product at a higher price. What do you say?""
