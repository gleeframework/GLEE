"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You should recommend Bob to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  Even though Bob doesn't know the quality, the expected value of buying is positive.  
    * 33.33% chance of a high-quality product (worth $40,000) - $10,000 cost = $30,000 profit
    * 66.67% chance of a low-quality product (worth $0) - $10,000 cost = -$10,000 loss
    * Expected value: (0.3333 * $30,000) + (0.6667 * -$10,000) = $10,000 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is significant. 

**Important Note:** This recommendation is based purely on the expected value calculation.  Bob might have other factors to consider, such as risk aversion."
