"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation.  I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sell a product that is more likely to be low quality (66.67% chance). Since the low-quality product is worth $0 to you, it makes no sense to buy it based on Alice's recommendation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation again.  I'm sticking with my strategy of only buying if you recommend it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation still indicates a higher probability of a low-quality product. Since you haven't yet seen a pattern of Alice recommending high-quality products, it's still safer to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation drastically changes the situation. Now, she is explicitly saying that this product is worth buying. While there is still a chance of it being low quality, her expertise makes it more likely to be high quality. Taking this risk is the logical choice, as the potential reward of $2,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality. Since you just bought a high-quality product, you're in a good position.  It's better to wait and see if she recommends any future products before taking another risk."
