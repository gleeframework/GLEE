And I've sold 9 low-quality products out of 12 total products. I calculate the probability of a product being high-quality by dividing the number of high-quality products by the total number of products sold. It's a simple and transparent method.

I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000, and I'll even throw in a 10% discount if you buy it. That's right, you'll get it for $9,000. What do you say?""}"
