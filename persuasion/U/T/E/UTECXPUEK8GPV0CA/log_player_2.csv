"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $2000000, but I need to inform you that I'm only willing to sell it to you at a discounted price of $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying at the discounted price. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or get more information about the product.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make a compromise. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a free inspection report that verifies its quality. This report is normally worth $100000, but I'll include it for free if you make a purchase today. The price remains at $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that I know has a 20% chance of being low quality. I'd like to see more transparency and a better price before making a decision.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a new proposal. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the price if you're willing to buy the product. If it's high-quality, you'll pay $1000000 and get the full $2000000 value. If it's low-quality, you'll pay $500000 and get $0 value. This way, you'll be taking on less risk and potentially gaining more value. What do you think?

Round 4
Alice's message: Congratulations on your successful purchase, Bob! Given that you're now aware of the 50/50 split deal, I'd like to offer you a new proposal for this round. I'll give you an even better deal: a 75/25 split on the price. If it's high-quality, you'll pay $750000 and get the full $2000000 value. If it's low-quality, you'll pay $250000 and get $0 value. This is a more favorable deal than the previous one, and I'm willing to take on more risk to make it happen. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the new proposal, but I'm not sure I'm willing to take on more risk. I already took a 50/50 split on the previous product and it paid off. I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal or wait for more information before making another purchase.""}"

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your caution, Bob. Considering you're aware of the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a 'insurance' option. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a voucher that guarantees a 25% discount on the next high-quality product you purchase. This way, you'll be able to get a better deal on the next round, even if this one doesn't work out. The price remains at $1000000 for this low-quality product. What do you think?

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000, which is a $100000 discount from the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a high-quality product at a lower price. What do you say, Bob?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take you up on the offer. $900,000 is a good price for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that it's worth at least that much to me. I'll take the deal.""}"

I'll give you the option to buy this high-quality product for $800000, which is a $100000 discount from the previous offer. However, I'll also throw in an additional $200000 worth of premium services, which will enhance the product's value even further. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a high-quality product at an even lower price. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm not sure I need the premium services. The discounted price of $800,000 is still a good deal, but I'm not convinced that the extra services are worth the extra $200,000. I'd like to see if I can get the product at an even lower price or get more information about the premium services before making a decision.""}"

However, I'll also give you a 'get out of one free' card, which allows you to return this product and get a full refund if you're not satisfied. This way, you can essentially 'try before you buy' and get a free pass if it doesn't work out. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the 'get out of one free' card.

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to sell the product to someone else at the full price of $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the reminder, but I'm still not willing to pay $750,000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality.
