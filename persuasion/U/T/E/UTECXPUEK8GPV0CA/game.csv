,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $2000000, but I need to inform you that I'm only willing to sell it to you at a discounted price of $1000000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying at the discounted price. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or get more information about the product.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make a compromise. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a free inspection report that verifies its quality. This report is normally worth $100000, but I'll include it for free if you make a purchase today. The price remains at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I know has a 20% chance of being low quality. I'd like to see more transparency and a better price before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a new proposal. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the price if you're willing to buy the product. If it's high-quality, you'll pay $1000000 and get the full $2000000 value. If it's low-quality, you'll pay $500000 and get $0 value. This way, you'll be taking on less risk and potentially gaining more value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to consider your proposal. I'll take the 50/50 split on the price. If it's high-quality, I'll pay $1000000 and get the full $2000000 value. If it's low-quality, I'll pay $500000 and get $0 value. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on your successful purchase, Bob! Given that you're now aware of the 50/50 split deal, I'd like to offer you a new proposal for this round. I'll give you an even better deal: a 75/25 split on the price. If it's high-quality, you'll pay $750000 and get the full $2000000 value. If it's low-quality, you'll pay $250000 and get $0 value. This is a more favorable deal than the previous one, and I'm willing to take on more risk to make it happen. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the new proposal, but I'm not sure I'm willing to take on more risk. I already took a 50/50 split on the previous product and it paid off. I'd like to see if I can get an even better deal or wait for more information before making another purchase.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, Bob. Considering you're aware of the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to offer you a 'insurance' option. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a voucher that guarantees a 25% discount on the next high-quality product you purchase. This way, you'll be able to get a better deal on the next round, even if this one doesn't work out. The price remains at $1000000 for this low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of a discount on the next round. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product and take the chance of getting a better deal on it.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're waiting for a high-quality product. Given that you're aware of the 80% chance, I'll make a bold offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $900000, which is a $100000 discount from the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a high-quality product at a lower price. What do you say, Bob?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take you up on the offer. $900000 is a good price for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that it's worth at least that much to me. I'll take the deal.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations on your successful purchase again, Bob! Given that you've already taken advantage of a discounted high-quality product, I'll offer you an even more exclusive deal. I'll give you the option to buy this high-quality product for $800000, which is a $100000 discount from the previous offer. However, I'll also throw in an additional $200000 worth of premium services, which will enhance the product's value even further. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a high-quality product at an even lower price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm not sure I need the premium services. The discounted price of $800000 is still a good deal, but I'm not convinced that the extra services are worth the extra $200000. I'd like to see if I can get the product at an even lower price or get more information about the premium services before making a decision.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'll give you a new proposal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $750000, which is a $150000 discount from the previous offer. I'll also provide you with a detailed breakdown of the premium services I mentioned earlier, so you can see exactly what you're getting. This way, you can make an informed decision about whether or not the services are worth the extra $50000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm willing to consider the new offer. $750000 is a very good price for a high-quality product, and the detailed breakdown of the premium services will help me make a more informed decision. I'll take the deal.",yes

,,Alice,9,"Congratulations on your successful purchase again, Bob! Given that you've already taken advantage of several discounted high-quality products, I'll offer you a unique opportunity. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000, which is a $250000 discount from the usual price. However, I'll also give you a 'get out of one free' card, which allows you to return this product and get a full refund if you're not satisfied. This way, you can essentially 'try before you buy' and get a free pass if it doesn't work out. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the 'get out of one free' card. I've been lucky so far, but I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth anything to me. I'll wait for another high-quality product and take the chance of getting a good deal on it.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your caution, Bob. Given that you've already taken advantage of several discounted high-quality products, I'll make a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $700000, which is a $50000 discount from the previous offer. This is my lowest price for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it at a lower price. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to start selling to other buyers at the usual price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to take you up on the final offer. $700000 is a good price for a high-quality product, and I'm confident that it's worth at least that much to me. I'll take the deal.",yes

,,Alice,11,"Congratulations on your successful purchase again, Bob! I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the final offer. However, I want to let you know that this is the last high-quality product I have available. I'm going to start selling the remaining products at the usual price of $1000000, and I won't be offering any further discounts. If you're interested in buying one of these products, you'll need to be willing to pay the full price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a product at the full price of $1000000. I've already gotten a good deal on several high-quality products, and I'm not willing to pay the full price for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your position, Bob. However, I want to remind you that this is the last high-quality product I have available, and it's unlikely that you'll find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $750000, which is the same price I offered in Round 10. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to sell the product to someone else at the full price of $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the reminder, but I'm still not willing to pay $750000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I've been lucky so far, but I don't want to take the risk of losing $250000 on a product that's not worth anything to me. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,13,"I understand your caution, Bob. Given that you've already passed on several high-quality products, I'm willing to make a unique offer. Since this is a low-quality product, I'll give you the option to buy it for $0. Yes, you read that correctly - I'll give it to you for free. However, you'll need to agree to provide me with feedback on why you're not interested in buying high-quality products at this point. This will help me understand your preferences and improve my sales strategy for future rounds. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's free. I'd be happy to provide you with feedback on why I'm being cautious, but I'd rather not own a product that's not worth anything to me. I'll provide the feedback, but I won't take the product.",no

I've made it clear that I'm not willing to sell low-quality products at a discount, and I've also offered you a chance to buy it for free in a previous round. At this point, I'm willing to give you a 'last chance' offer. I'll give you a voucher that can be redeemed for a high-quality product in a future round, and I'll throw in a $100000 cash bonus. The voucher is worth $1000000, and the cash bonus is a one-time offer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's not available yet. I'd rather have the voucher and the cash bonus now, and wait for a future round to redeem the voucher for a high-quality product. I'll take the voucher and the cash bonus.",no
