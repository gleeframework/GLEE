low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00% and I can get it for $100, which is a good deal if it turns out to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50, as I'm taking a risk given the low quality product sold to the previous buyer."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products have been low quality, which is a higher proportion than the 20% chance of low quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products recommended by you were low quality, which might indicate that you're more likely to recommend low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems unlikely that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them bought high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%, which would make the expected value of buying a product less than $100. I'd like to wait and see the recommendation for the next buyer to get a better sense of the product's quality."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which would be a loss of $75."
