Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns. However, I'd like to remind you that the last product you passed on was a high-quality one. Given that you're still unsure about the next product, I'm offering you a deal on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $100000.

You'll still get a valuable product worth $1200000 to you, and you'll get to see the quality of the next product. This is a good opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a relatively good price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",

Given that you've already bought a high-quality product, I'll offer you a chance to get a 'free' product. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a refund of $50000. So, in essence, you'll be paying $50000 for a product that's worth $0 to you. This way, you'll get to see the quality of the next product, and you'll have a chance to break even on this purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in paying $50,000 for a product worth $0 to me, even if I get a refund of $50,000. It's a break-even deal, but I'd rather not spend any money on a product that has no value to me.""

However, I'll also throw in a 'golden ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to buy the next two products at the original price of $1200000 each. This way, you'll get a high-quality product at a relatively good price, and you'll have the opportunity to buy the next two products at a price that's already been discounted in your mind.
