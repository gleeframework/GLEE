,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the products being sold are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it's likely that the products sold so far were low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be betting against the odds, and I'd rather not take that risk."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical about the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product."
