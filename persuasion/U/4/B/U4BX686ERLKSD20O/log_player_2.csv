Alice's message: Welcome to our exclusive offer! As you may know, our products have a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. However, I'd like to highlight that our previous buyer's decision to purchase was likely driven by the statistics, not the guarantee. This product, on the other hand, has a unique charm to it. I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to emphasize that it's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?

Alice's message: I understand your curiosity about the product's unique charm! Unfortunately, I'm a bit tight-lipped about the specifics, but I can assure you that it's a one-of-a-kind item. As you consider this offer, I want to remind you that our previous buyer's decision to purchase was likely driven by the statistics. This product, on the other hand, has a unique opportunity cost - it's a chance to own something that may not be available again. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! As for the previous buyer, I can tell you that they did indeed consider the statistics, but what ultimately swayed their decision was the confidence they had in our brand's reputation.

Alice's message: I understand your request for a probability estimate! Based on our sales record, we've had 8 buyers, with 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 37.5% (3/8). However, since we've had a streak of low-quality products, I'd estimate the probability of the current product being high-quality to be slightly lower, around 25-30%. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and the actual quality of the product is still unknown. The price remains the same at $10000. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this product?
