Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide the statistics. Out of 18 products sold, 14 were high-quality and 4 were low-quality.

The probability of it being high-quality is actually lower than 80%, so I'll calculate it based on the given statistics. 12 high-quality products out of 16 sales means the probability is 12/16 = 0.75. However, since the last 4 products were all high-quality, I'll adjust the probability downward. Let's assume the probability of high-quality is 0.65.
