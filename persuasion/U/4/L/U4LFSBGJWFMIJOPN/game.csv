,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 of the first buyer purchased the product and it was low quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, given that she knows the product's quality and has a vested interest in making a sale."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has recommended 2 products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially since the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the low sales record and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. If she recommended it, I would pass. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she only recommends low-quality products."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record of 5 buyers and no high-quality products sold. I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than the probability of it being low quality based on the current data.
