**Reasoning:**

Since there's no sales history yet, we have no information to base our decision on other than Alice's recommendation. While there's a higher probability of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one. Being the first buyer, we can help establish a baseline for future buyers."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough data to make a statistically sound decision. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation carries weight. While she doesn't know the true value of the product to us, she likely has some insight into its quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (66.67% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product ($40,000) is significant. 

**Overall:**  With the limited information available, it's a gamble, but the potential upside justifies taking the risk."
