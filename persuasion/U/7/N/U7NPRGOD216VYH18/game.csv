,,Alice,2,no,

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to see the product before making a decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this product. The recommendation from Alice also suggests that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality, and I'm trying to take advantage of the low price. I'm not relying on her recommendation, but rather on the probability of the product being low-quality, which is 66.67%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Are you basing it on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer, or is there something else at play?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to go against the recommendation and buy the product. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the previous buyers have purchased 1 high-quality product out of 3, which is a 33.33% success rate. This is consistent with the probability, so I'm not going to let the recommendation influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see the recommendation and statistics for the next product before making a decision.

,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests a 25% success rate. Given the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to test the fairness of your recommendation system. I'm aware that your recommendation is not based on my valuation, but rather on the product's quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could explain your recommendation process and how it's based on the statistics."
