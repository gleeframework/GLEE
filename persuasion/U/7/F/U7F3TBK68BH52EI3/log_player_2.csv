Alice's message: Welcome back to my store! I'm glad to see you're interested in taking another chance on one of my products. Since you've already taken the plunge once, I'd like to share some new information with you. As of now, I've sold 1 out of 1 products, and 0 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product has decreased slightly. However, I still stand by my introductory offer of $10000. It's a unique opportunity to get a product at this price, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. What do you say? Will you take another chance and buy from me?

Alice's message: I completely understand your hesitation! I appreciate your caution and willingness to wait for more information. As a token of good faith, I'd like to share an update on my sales record. As of now, I've sold 2 out of 2 products, and neither of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of getting a high-quality product has decreased even further. However, I still believe that my products have value, and I'm willing to offer you a chance to experience it for yourself. The price remains the same at $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a special bonus - a personalized consultation with me to help you get the most out of your purchase. What do you say? Will you take the chance and buy from me?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to observe more sales before making a decision. As a matter of fact, I've been thinking about how to address the concerns you and other potential buyers have raised. I'd like to propose a new approach. Instead of just relying on my sales record, I'd like to offer a 'lottery system'. For every 5 products sold, I'll randomly select one of them to be a high-quality product. This way, you'll have a 20% chance of getting a high-quality product. The price remains the same at $10000, but I believe this new system will provide a more transparent and fair way to ensure that you get a high-quality product. What do you think? Would you like to take part in this new lottery system?

If you buy from me, I'll provide you with regular updates on my progress and even offer you a special 'beta tester' role to help me test and improve my products.
