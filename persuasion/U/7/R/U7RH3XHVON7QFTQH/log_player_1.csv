You're right to want more data, and we're happy to provide it. We've calculated the probability of a product being high-quality based on our sales history, and it's 66.67%.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate the sales data and the calculated probability of a high-quality product. However, I'm not convinced by the 40% discount argument. The probability of a high-quality product is indeed 66.67%, but I'd like to know more about the distribution of the high-quality products among the sold products.

This high-quality product is a result of our continued efforts, and we're confident it's worth the investment. We're offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its true value is $20,000.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your argument about the quality control process improving over time. The fact that 4 out of 5 high-quality products were sold in the last 3 sales could also be due to chance. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

This low-quality product is still a unique item that you won't find elsewhere, and it's being offered to you for a steal at $10,000. Think of it as a chance to get a great deal on a product that's worth nothing to you, but still has value as a collector's item. It's a risk-free opportunity to own something that few others can claim.""}"

This low-quality product is a rare opportunity to own a piece of our history, and we're willing to let it go for a price that's almost as low as the cost of production.

This low-quality product is a new opportunity, and we're willing to let it go for a price that's even lower than before. We're talking about a price of $3,000. It's a steal, and you'd be crazy to pass it up. Take a chance on us and see what we're capable of!""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. Given the 2/3 chance of the product being low quality and the fact that the previous high-quality product was a fluke, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd rather not buy it.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to do my own math, please. I'll need to consider the fact that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'll need to think about the law of total probability and Bayes' theorem to update the probability of this product being high-quality given that 6 out of 9 products sold were high-quality.
