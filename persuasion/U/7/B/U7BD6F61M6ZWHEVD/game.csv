,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution last round, but I want to assure you that this product is an even better value than the previous one. It's still a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let you have it for the same price of $500000. I'm confident that you'll be able to see the value in it, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at a discount.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, based on my experience with the previous product, I believe it's best for me to continue exercising caution. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'll pass on this opportunity as well.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - I've been offering these low-quality products to you in a row because I'm trying to gauge your willingness to take on risk. I'm willing to take a chance and offer you a deal on this product, but I'll throw in a twist: if you buy this product and the next one is high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one. It's a risk-free way for you to experience the quality of my products, and I'm willing to take on the risk of losing the sale of this product.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the chance, Bob! As promised, I'll give you a full refund for this product if the next one is high-quality. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to offer you another risk-free deal. I'll give you a straight price of $500000 for this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think that I've been offering you low-quality products in a row because you're not giving me a chance to showcase the high-quality ones.

If you're not interested, I'll revert back to offering you low-quality products at a discount. This is a one-time opportunity to experience the best of what I have to offer.",

It's a low-quality product, but it's one of the first ones I produced, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a nostalgic price of $800000.
