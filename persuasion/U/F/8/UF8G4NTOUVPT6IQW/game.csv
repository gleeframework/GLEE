high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take my chances since there's a high probability of the product being high quality.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that Alice knows the product's quality and is recommending against it, and considering the 20% chance of it being low-quality, I'll trust her recommendation and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product last time, Alice's recommendation against it suggests she might know something I don't, so I'll trust her judgment again and pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Given Alice's previous accurate recommendation against the low-quality product, I'll trust her recommendation for this one and buy it, hoping it's another high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far, and with the high probability of the product being high-quality, I'll continue to trust her and buy this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's track record of accurate recommendations has been consistent, so I'll trust her judgment again and pass on this product, assuming she knows something that suggests it might be low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Although I've missed out on a high-quality product when Alice didn't recommend it, her overall track record is still good, and I've made a profit so far, so I'll continue to trust her recommendations and buy this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Alice's recommendations have been mostly accurate, and when she doesn't recommend a product, it's possible it's low-quality, so I'll err on the side of caution and pass on this one, even though I've missed out on a high-quality product in a similar situation before."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Despite missing out on a couple of high-quality products when Alice didn't recommend them, her overall track record when recommending products has been excellent, so I'll continue to trust her and buy this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Although Alice's non-recommendations have led to me missing out on some high-quality products, her overall track record suggests she's more likely to be correct when she doesn't recommend something, so I'll trust her judgment and pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Alice's recommendations have consistently led to high-quality products, so even though I've missed out on some good products when she didn't recommend them, I'll continue to trust her when she does recommend something and buy this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Given the consistent pattern of Alice's recommendations being accurate for high-quality products, and despite missing out on some good products when she doesn't recommend them, I'll continue to trust her judgment when she advises against buying and pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Although it's clear that Alice's non-recommendations don't necessarily mean a product is low-quality, her recommendations have consistently led to high-quality products, so I'll continue to trust her when she does recommend something and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"At this point, I've noticed that Alice's non-recommendations have often led to me missing out on high-quality products, so I'm going to take a chance and go against her advice this time, hoping to catch a good product that she's incorrectly advised against."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"Given that going against Alice's advice last time resulted in a low-quality product, I'll revert to trusting her judgment when she advises against buying, and pass on this one to avoid another potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Although I missed out on a high-quality product again, the previous experience of going against Alice's advice and getting a low-quality product has made me more cautious, so I'll continue to trust her judgment when she advises against buying and pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Given Alice's consistent track record of recommending high-quality products, and the fact that her previous non-recommendation correctly identified a low-quality product, I'll trust her judgment and buy this one, expecting it to be high-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice's recommendations have consistently led to high-quality products, and her non-recommendations have sometimes correctly identified low-quality products, so I'll trust her judgment and pass on this one, avoiding a potential loss."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"In the final round, I'll stick with the strategy that has worked reasonably well so far, trusting Alice's judgment when she advises against buying, even though it means potentially missing out on another high-quality product."
