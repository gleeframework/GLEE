Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Here's why:

* **The buyer knows your selling record:**  They know you've sold 3 low-quality products and no high-quality ones. 
* **They are rational:**  Even though they don't know the value of a high-quality product to them, they'll reason that the odds of this being a high-quality product are higher now (because the probability is 33.33% and you've only sold low-quality products so far). 
* **The price is fixed:** There's no risk of getting a worse deal later. 

**Recommendation:**  Since the product is high-quality and you have a good chance of the buyer accepting due to the odds, it's a good idea to recommend the purchase."
