**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since all 5 previous buyers who purchased based on her recommendation got high-quality products, there's a strong indication that she's accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **The odds:** Even without Alice's recommendation, the 80% chance of a high-quality product makes the purchase worthwhile. The potential gain ($120) outweighs the potential loss ($0).

Therefore, it's a logical decision to buy the product based on the combination of Alice's recommendation and the favorable odds."

**Explanation:**

Given the statistics:

* 6 buyers purchased products.
* 6 high-quality products were sold.

This means all the products purchased were of high quality.  Since Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, we can confidently assume the current product is also of high quality.  It's worth $120 to us, and the price is only $100, so it's a good deal."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 14 high-quality products sold out of 14 buyers, the success rate is 100%.  This strongly suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly reliable.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which further reinforces the likelihood of a high-quality product.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even if there's a small chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 (high-quality product) outweighs the risk of $0 (low-quality product). 

**It's important to note:** This is a simplified scenario. In a real-world situation, there might be other factors to consider, such as the cost of the product, the seller's reputation, and individual risk tolerance."
