,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there is no information to make an informed decision based on the seller's previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the first buyer didn't buy it after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation is to buy and there have been no high-quality products sold yet, it's likely that the product is low-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more information about the seller's sales before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I suspect that the products recommended to them were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the product recommended to me is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, I think the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed, I suspect that the products they were recommended to buy were low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be essentially betting that the product I'm being recommended is high-quality, which seems unlikely given the previous data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm hesitant to buy given Alice's recommendation and the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and the products they received?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'm curious, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, shouldn't I be more likely to get a high-quality product, since the probability of the remaining products being high-quality would be higher than 50%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the fact that none of the previous three buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that the products recommended by Alice may be low-quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, Alice. Is it because the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, or is there another reason?"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product. I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low, and I don't want to take the risk of paying $1000000 for a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm not convinced it's a good idea, but I'm willing to take the risk."
