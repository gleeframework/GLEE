,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'll learn from my experience and see if the product is high or low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know the updated statistics after this decision.

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the product anyway."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall proportion. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be contributing to the problem of having more low-quality products left. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't buy the products you recommended, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been buying low-quality products, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced it's high-quality given Alice's recommendation and the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased the products.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have rejected your products, I'm inclined to believe that they were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if you have any more to offer."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that might be worthless to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the 5th buyer and there have been no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be higher than 50%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the high-quality products recommended by you. This suggests that there might be a bias in your recommendations or a pattern in the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the products being sold are low-quality. I'd rather wait for a different product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 out of 5 previous products were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50%, but I'm not willing to take the risk without more information."
