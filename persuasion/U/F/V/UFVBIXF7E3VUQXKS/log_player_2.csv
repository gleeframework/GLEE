  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall proportion. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll be contributing to the problem of having more low-quality products left. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change.""
