,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? I've seen that 2 out of 3 previous buyers bought the products after your recommendation, which suggests that your recommendations are generally good. However, since I don't know the quality of the product, I'd like to take the risk and buy it anyway.",,,,,,,,,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the statistics, 40% of the products sold so far have been high-quality, which is lower than the 50% probability of a product being high-quality. This suggests that there may be a higher proportion of low-quality products left in the pool. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered.",,,,,,,,,
