Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the game setup and rules
The game involves buying products from Alice, who sells them at a fixed price of $100. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality (worth $120 to me) and a 50% chance of being low quality (worth $0 to me). Alice reveals the true quality of the product and provides a recommendation based on that quality. I have access to Alice's sales record, which includes the number of potential buyers, the number of products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold.

## Step 2: Analyze the given statistics
The statistics show that 3 buyers have purchased products based on Alice's recommendations, and all 3 products were high-quality. This means that 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality.

## Step 3: Consider the implications of Alice's recommendation
Given that Alice recommends buying the current product, and considering that all previously sold products were high-quality, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are reliable. Since the product's true quality is revealed, and Alice's recommendation is to buy, it implies that the current product is likely high-quality.

## Step 4: Weigh the potential gain and loss
If I buy the product and it's high-quality, I gain $20 ($120 - $100). If it's low-quality, I lose $100. Given the 50% chance of the product being high-quality and Alice's reliable recommendation, the expected value of buying the product is positive.

## Step 5: Make a decision based on the analysis
Based on the analysis, I should buy the product, as the expected value is positive, and Alice's recommendation is reliable.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation, Alice.""}"
