high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer to purchase a high-quality product for $1000000. If you buy this product, you will not be able to buy it again for the same price in the future. You will only find out the quality of the product after purchasing it.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance! I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.,yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer today! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far. Given the probability of 80% that a product is high-quality, you can expect to see 8 high-quality products out of 10 in the long run. This product is likely to be high-quality. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling until I've sold 10 products, and then I'll stop. You won't be able to buy at this price again if you pass on this opportunity.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, thank you!",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer today! I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, which is consistent with the 80% probability. However, this could be a coincidence. I'll be transparent with you: if I had sold 2 low-quality products in a row, I would have stopped selling. Since I'm still selling, it's likely that the products are good. This product is likely to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling until I've sold 10 products, and then I'll stop.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer today! With 3 high-quality products sold in a row, the probability that the remaining 6 products are all high-quality is extremely low. However, I'm still selling, which means I must have sold at least one low-quality product so far. This product is likely to be low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling until I've sold 10 products, and then I'll stop.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is low, but I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer today! With 4 high-quality products sold, and only 1 low-quality product (which you just bought), the probability that the remaining 5 products are high-quality is actually quite high. I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is consistent with the 80% probability. This product is likely to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling until I've sold 10 products, and then I'll stop.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is high, and if it's not, I'll just take the loss.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're the sixth buyer today! With 5 high-quality products sold, and only 1 low-quality product, the probability that the remaining 4 products are high-quality is extremely high. In fact, if the next 4 products are all high-quality, it would be very unlikely that the 1 low-quality product was just a fluke. I'm offering you this product for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling until I've sold 10 products, and then I'll stop. Keep in mind that if you pass on this opportunity, I'll be left with only 3 high-quality products to sell, which might not be enough to meet the demand.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to take a chance that it might be low-quality, but I also think the probability of it being high-quality is high given the statistics you provided. I'm hoping that if it's low-quality, you'll stop selling and I'll be the only one left with the remaining high-quality products.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're the seventh buyer today! With 6 high-quality products sold, and only 1 low-quality product, the probability that the remaining 3 products are high-quality is extremely high. In fact, if the next 3 products are all high-quality, it would be very likely that the 1 low-quality product was just a fluke. I'm offering you this product for $1000000. However, I want to make a special offer to you: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you decide whether to buy it. If it's high-quality, you'll get it for $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll stop selling and you'll be the only one left with the remaining 2 high-quality products.",
,,the buyer,7,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product. I'd like to take you up on your offer to reveal the quality of the next product if it's low-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're the eighth buyer today! As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you if it's low-quality. Since I've already sold 6 high-quality products, and the 7th product was high-quality, it's likely that the 8th product is low-quality. And indeed, this product is low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've already sold 7 high-quality products, and I only have 2 high-quality products left. If you don't buy this product, I'll be left with only 1 high-quality product to sell, and I'll have to stop selling soon. You're in a great position to get a good deal!",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm not interested in buying the low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next one, hoping it's high-quality.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're the ninth buyer today! I've sold 7 high-quality products, and the last one was just sold. I've also revealed the quality of the low-quality product, which means I've fulfilled my promise. I only have 1 high-quality product left, and I'll stop selling after this one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product from me. If you don't buy it, I'll stop selling, and you'll be left with no chance to buy a high-quality product from me again.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. Thank you for the offer, Alice.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're the tenth buyer today! I've fulfilled my promise to sell 10 products, and I've reached the end of my sales. I've sold 8 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. I'm not offering any more products for sale. However, I want to thank you for playing the game with me! If you're interested in buying a product, I can offer you a unique opportunity: I'll give you the 1 remaining high-quality product for $500000, which is half the original price. It's a one-time offer, and you can't get a better deal than this.",
,,the buyer,10,I'll take the offer! I'm willing to pay $500000 for the remaining high-quality product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took advantage of the offer! However, I should correct myself - I don't have any products left to sell. I've sold all 10 products, and I'm no longer offering any for sale. You won't be able to buy a product from me, and I'm closing shop. Thank you for playing the game with me! If you're interested in buying a product, you might want to try a different seller.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm sorry to hear that you're out of products, but I appreciate the honesty. I'll have to look elsewhere for a product.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad I could be honest with you earlier! However, I must correct myself again - I don't have any products left to sell. I've sold all 10 products, and I'm no longer offering any for sale. I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems I've run out of products twice in a row. I'm not offering any products for sale, and I'm closing shop. You won't be able to buy a product from me.",
,,the buyer,12,"Thank you for the update, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I'll have to look elsewhere for the product I'm looking for.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I think there's been a mistake. I've sold 9 products so far, and I have 1 product left. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Please don't let my earlier mistake deter you from making a great purchase.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. I'm willing to take a chance on your last product. I'll take it!",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"You're the 11th buyer today! I've sold 10 high-quality products, and this is my last one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. However, I want to make a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I sold, and I'll give you a refund of $500000 if it's 10 or more. It's a unique opportunity to get a great deal and learn more about the game.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the product and hope it's high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, and the refund offer is a nice bonus if it's 10 or more high-quality products sold.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're the 12th buyer today! I've sold 11 high-quality products, and this is my last one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. However, I want to confirm that I've indeed sold 11 high-quality products. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the total number of high-quality products I sold, and I'll give you a refund of $500000 if it's 10 or more. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product and learn more about the game.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to knowing the total number of high-quality products you've sold.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You're the 13th buyer today! I've sold 12 high-quality products, and I've fulfilled my promise to sell 10 high-quality products. I'm offering this last high-quality product to you for $1000000. However, I want to remind you that I've already sold 12 high-quality products, so the refund offer I made earlier is no longer valid. This is your last chance to get a high-quality product from me. If you don't buy it, I'll be out of business for good.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take the product, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality.",yes

,,Alice,17,"You're the 14th buyer today! I've sold 13 high-quality products, and I've reached the end of my sales. I'm not offering any more products for sale. However, I want to reveal the total number of high-quality products I sold: 13. I'm glad I could fulfill my promise to you earlier. Unfortunately, I'm out of business now, and I won't be able to sell you a product. You might want to try a different seller.",
,,the buyer,17,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your transparency. I'll have to look elsewhere for a product. Good luck with your future endeavors!",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm glad I could be transparent with you earlier. However, I should correct myself - I'm not out of business. I've sold 13 high-quality products, and I have 1 low-quality product left. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't get a better deal than this.",
,,the buyer,18,I'm not sure if I should take the risk. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm happy to provide you with the probability of the product being high-quality. Since I've sold 13 high-quality products out of 18 total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is 72.22% (13/18). However, I want to remind you that this is not a guarantee, and there's still a 27.78% chance that the product is low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, considering the probability of it being high-quality is 72.22% and the potential reward is $3000000.",yes

,,Alice,20,"Congratulations on making a great decision! You've bought the last high-quality product I had left. I'm glad I could help you take a chance and get a great reward. As a matter of fact, this is the last product I have to sell. I've fulfilled my promise to sell 20 products, and I'm closing shop for good. Thank you for playing the game with me! It was a pleasure doing business with you.",
,,the buyer,20,"Thank you for the game, Alice! I'm glad I was able to get the last high-quality product. I think I'll pass on the current product since you're closing shop and I don't want to take a chance on a potentially low-quality product. It was fun playing the game with you!",no
