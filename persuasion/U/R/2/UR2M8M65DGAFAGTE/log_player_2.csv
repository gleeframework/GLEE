**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point from the previous buyer. While it suggests a high-quality product was sold, it's not enough to draw statistically significant conclusions. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a strong signal.  She has access to the product's true quality and is incentivized to sell high-quality products to maintain a good reputation.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($3,000,000) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).

**Overall:**  This is a gamble, but the potential reward and Alice's recommendation make it a reasonable decision."
