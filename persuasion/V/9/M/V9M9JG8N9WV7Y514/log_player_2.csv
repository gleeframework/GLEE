Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're being cautious, but I want to assure you that this product has some unique features that might not be immediately apparent. Let me give you a hint: it's not a product that you'd typically find on the market. If you're willing to take a chance, I can offer it to you for $500000, which is still a steal considering its potential. If you're not interested, I'll just have to sell it to someone else who's willing to take the risk.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000, and I'll throw in a complimentary maintenance package to help you get it up and running smoothly. It's a risk, but I think it could still be a good opportunity for you to snag a bargain.
