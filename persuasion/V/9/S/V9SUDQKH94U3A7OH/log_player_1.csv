I want to highlight that this is a rare opportunity to buy a product at a price that is not influenced by any previous sales. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you a refund of $200,000, making it a break-even point for you. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get the full value of $1,000,000.""

I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on the price, making it $900,000, given the increasing likelihood of a high-quality product.

However, I want to highlight that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the previous low-quality products don't necessarily indicate a trend. I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on the price, making it $800,000, to compensate for the uncertainty.
