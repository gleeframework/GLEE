What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is not based on your reassurance or the bet, but rather on the expected value calculation. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, I can expect to gain $2083.33 ($12500 - $10000) if I buy it.
