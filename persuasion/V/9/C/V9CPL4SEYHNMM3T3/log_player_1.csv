You know that half of my products are high-quality, and half are low-quality. You can either take a chance and buy it, or walk away. The choice is yours.""

"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the expected value of the product being $2000000, given the 50% chance of it being high-quality and 50% chance of it being low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with more information about the products in the future, such as any patterns or characteristics that might indicate their quality.

The next product could be high-quality or low-quality, and I have no way of knowing which it is. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to remind you that the expected value is still $500000, as calculated by you in the previous round.""

I'm hoping that this is just a streak and the next one will be high-quality. I'm not convinced by the probability argument, as the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the streak of low-quality products is a red flag for me.

I'm not convinced by your attempt to downplay the significance of the two low-quality products in a row, and I think there's a good chance that the previous high-quality sales were a fluke.
