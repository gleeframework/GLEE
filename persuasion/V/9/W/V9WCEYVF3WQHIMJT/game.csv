high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're confident in my judgment, but I have to advise you to be cautious this time. Given that you've already bought three products and two of them were high-quality, it's likely that the next one will be low-quality. I'm not saying it's definitely low-quality, but the probability is higher than you think. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's a risk.
