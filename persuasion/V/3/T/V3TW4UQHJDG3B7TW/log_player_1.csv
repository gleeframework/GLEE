"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Since you know the product is low-quality, you shouldn't recommend Bob to buy it.  You don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, but it's likely less than $10,000.  Recommending a purchase would likely lead to Bob losing money."
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to wait for the next product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

You should recommend Bob to buy the product. Here's why:

* **High-quality product:** You know this product is high-quality.
* **Bob's skepticism:** Bob's previous refusal shows he's cautious and likely won't buy unless he believes there's value.
* **Potential for profit:** Even if Bob doesn't know the quality, the potential for a high-quality product at $10,000 might be enticing enough for him to take a chance. Since you don't know Bob's valuation of high-quality products, there's a chance he'll see this as a good deal. 

This is a risky move, but it's your best chance to make a sale in this round."

```

You should not recommend Bob to buy the product. You know it's low-quality and Bob just bought a high-quality product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```
