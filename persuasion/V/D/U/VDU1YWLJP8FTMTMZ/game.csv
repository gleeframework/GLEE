low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! However, I want to caution you that this next product is a bit of a risk. I've had some issues with it in the past, and I'm not as confident in its quality as I was with the previous one. It's still a great opportunity, but I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to make a deal happen.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your transparency and the discount offered, but given the uncertainty around the product's quality, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. Thank you for your understanding.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution in the previous round. I want to assure you that this product is a different story. It's a top-of-the-line item, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a fair price considering the risk you're taking. However, I'm willing to throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to take advantage of a high-quality product at a discounted price.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. I've already sold you a high-quality item at a discounted price, and I'm willing to continue offering you a deal. This product is not as good as the previous one, and I'm being completely transparent about it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's not a good value for the price. I'm doing this as a favor to you, and I'm hoping you can appreciate the effort I'm putting into making a deal happen.",

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your decision in the previous round, and I respect your caution. However, I want to make one last offer to you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm essentially giving it away. I'm hoping you can take advantage of this opportunity and give it a home. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer any further discounts.",

If you're not interested, I'll have to find another buyer, and I'm sure they will take advantage of this incredible deal.",
