low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm worried that this product might also be low-quality. If I can get a discount, I'm willing to take the risk.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,"All 7 previous products were low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but our current sales record is 0% high-quality so far."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 4 buyers, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold to the previous 4 buyers, based on the current statistics.",
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"This product is an exception to our current sales record. Although all 8 previous products were low-quality, I have reason to believe that this one is high-quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Out of the 9 previous products, 8 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality, but unfortunately wasn't sold. The proportion of low-quality products sold so far is 100%."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.,
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"Out of the 10 previous products, 9 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality, but unfortunately wasn't sold. Although our sales record is mostly low-quality products, I have reason to believe that this one is high-quality. This is the second high-quality product we've had, and I highly recommend it."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability based on the previous sales record?,
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"Out of the 11 previous products, 9 were low-quality and 2 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. Although our sales record doesn't reflect it, we've had 2 high-quality products so far, and this one is also high-quality. I highly recommend it."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation or more information before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"Out of the 12 previous products, 9 were low-quality and 3 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. I must admit that our sales record is biased towards low-quality products, and this product is also low-quality. I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"Out of the 13 previous products, 10 were low-quality and 3 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. Our sales record suggests a lower probability of getting a high-quality product. This product is also low-quality, and I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't trust your recommendation and I want to see for myself if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll be disappointed, but at least I'll know the truth.",
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"Out of the 14 previous products, 11 were low-quality and 3 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold... until now, I have a chance to change that. I assure you, this product is high-quality, and I highly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation history before making a purchase.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"Out of the 15 previous products, 11 were low-quality and 4 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. I understand that our recommendation history is biased, and I don't want to mislead you. This product is low-quality, and I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice does not recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, suggesting a bias towards low-quality products.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"Out of the 16 previous products, 12 were low-quality and 4 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. Our sales record speaks for itself, and I don't want to add to the low-quality sales. This product is low-quality, and I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought it, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than the overall proportion. Since Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm going to take a chance and wait for the next product.",
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"Out of the 17 previous products, 13 were low-quality and 4 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. However, I can assure you that this product is high-quality, and I highly recommend buying it. The buyer's reasoning from the previous round is correct, and the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is indeed likely to be higher. Don't miss this opportunity!"
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I've seen that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 6th buyer. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"Out of the 18 previous products, 13 were low-quality and 5 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. I understand that my previous recommendations may have been misleading, and I want to be transparent with you. This product is low-quality, and I don't recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. If 5 out of 5 products were not worth it, I'm skeptical about the chances of this one being high-quality.",
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"Out of the 19 previous products, 14 were low-quality and 5 were high-quality, but unfortunately none of the high-quality products were sold. I know that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable, but I assure you that this product is truly high-quality. This is the last round, and I want to end on a positive note. I highly recommend buying this product."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision, given the previous sales record.",
