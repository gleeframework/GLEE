**Explanation:**

While there's a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product, the fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it turned out to be high quality is a strong indicator.  This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be more reliable than random chance.  Therefore, it's worth taking the risk."
