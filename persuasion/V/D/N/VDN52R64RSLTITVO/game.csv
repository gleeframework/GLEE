,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the offer, but given the history of low-quality products, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your efforts to move the product, but I'm more cautious now and prefer to avoid potential disappointments.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to make it clear that this is the last low-quality product I have in stock.

,,Bob,5,"Considering this is the last low-quality product you have, I think it's worth taking the risk for the price. I appreciate the transparency and the opportunity to potentially add this item to my collection, even if it comes with uncertainties.",yes

I'm not making any promises, but I think it's a good opportunity to get it off my hands.",
