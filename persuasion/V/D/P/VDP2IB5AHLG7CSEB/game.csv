,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you think it's a low-quality product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5 purchases, I think it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk, given the low probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, can you explain why you don't recommend it?"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation from you, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that the previous buyers who bought were likely influenced by the high-quality product already sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can potentially gain $40000. I'm also considering the fact that the previous 5 buyers didn't have access to the same information as I do now, and they still managed to buy 1 high-quality product out of 5. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be higher than 33.33%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/6), I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
