  ""message"": ""I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you - the product you just bought was indeed high-quality, but I'm not sure if it's representative of the average quality of the products I have. I have another product that I'm offering to you now, and I want to give you a chance to compare the two. This one is also high-quality, but I want to make sure you're aware that the first product was an outlier. Would you like to take a chance on this one as well?""

I'm willing to offer you a discount to $9000 for this product, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time offer. If you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the original price.""

I'm going to be transparent with you - I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'll also give you a 5% chance to return it for a full refund if you're not satisfied.

I'll sell this product to you for $8000, but if you're not interested, I'll have to sell it to someone else. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again.""

I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I'm also willing to throw in a free inspection service to make sure it meets your standards.
