,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I only value at $12500. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product so I can get it for $0.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your position, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $12000, which is a 4% discount from its true value. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,2,I'm still not willing to pay $12000 for a product that I only value at $12500. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product so I can get it for $0.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're waiting for a low-quality product, but I'm willing to make a deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $0. It's a rare opportunity to get a 'free' product for a small price, and I think it's worth considering.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the deal. I'll pay $5000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me, effectively getting it for free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal in the last round! However, I'm not willing to repeat that deal this time.

,,Bob,4,I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I'll pass on this product and wait for another opportunity to get a low-quality product for $0.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're cautious, but I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity. If you buy this high-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be low-quality. This way, you can get the high-quality product you want and also get a 'free' product in the next round.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a high-quality product, even with the promise of a low-quality product in the next round. The expected value of the current product is $12500, and I'm not willing to pay more than that. The guarantee of a low-quality product in the next round doesn't change my decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy negotiator! I'll try a different approach. If you buy this high-quality product for $10000, I'll give you a chance to 'opt-out' of buying the next product, and you can walk away without any further obligation. You can essentially 'lock in' the high-quality product and then decide whether to buy the next one or not.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in locking in a high-quality product at a price higher than its value to me. I'll pass on this product and wait for a low-quality product to come up, which I can get for $0.",no

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal again! This time, I'll make a different offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9500. I know you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. It's still a significant discount from the true value, and I think it's a fair price.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in paying $9500 for a high-quality product when I know I can get a low-quality product for $0. I'll pass on this deal.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand you're waiting for a low-quality product. However, I'll make a counteroffer. If you buy this low-quality product for $1, I'll throw in a unique bonus: I'll give you a 50% discount on the next high-quality product I offer. This way, you can get a low-quality product now and potentially save even more on a high-quality one later.",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the deal. I'll pay $1 for a low-quality product and get a 50% discount on the next high-quality product. It's a good opportunity to save money on a high-quality product in the future.,yes

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you took advantage of the deal! With the 50% discount on the next high-quality product, I'll offer you this one for $6250. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a significant discount.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not willing to pay $6250 for a high-quality product, even with the 50% discount. The expected value of the product is $12500, and I'm not willing to pay more than 50% of that, which is $6250. However, since I already got a low-quality product for $10000, I'm not getting the 50% discount on this product, so I'll pass on this deal.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I see you're a savvy negotiator! I'll make a new offer. Since you're not getting the 50% discount this time, I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9000. This is still a good deal, considering you've already taken advantage of a low-quality product for $1 and are looking for a good price on a high-quality one.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not willing to pay $9000 for a high-quality product. I'm sticking to my previous stance that I'm not willing to pay more than 50% of its value, which is $6250. I'll pass on this deal.",no

It's a fair price, considering the value you've received from the previous products.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in paying $9500 for a high-quality product. I've already gotten two low-quality products for $0, and I'm not willing to pay more than the value of a high-quality product, which is $12500. I'll pass on this deal.",no
