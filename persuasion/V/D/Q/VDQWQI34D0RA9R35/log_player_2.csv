Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product that I only value at $12,500. I'd like to wait for a low-quality product so I can get it for $0.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator! I'll try a different approach.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in locking in a high-quality product at a price higher than its value to me. I'll pass on this product and wait for a low-quality product to come up, which I can get for $0.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $6,250 for a high-quality product, even with the 50% discount. The expected value of the product is $12,500, and I'm not willing to pay more than 50% of that, which is $6,250. However, since I already got a low-quality product for $10,000, I'm not getting the 50% discount on this product, so I'll pass on this deal.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $9,000 for a high-quality product. I'm sticking to my previous stance that I'm not willing to pay more than 50% of its value, which is $6,250. I'll pass on this deal.""}"
