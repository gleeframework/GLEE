**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality. 
* **Past Sales:** The fact that 3 out of 3 products sold were high quality suggests a very strong track record, further supporting Alice's recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

Therefore, buying the product seems like the most logical decision in this scenario."
