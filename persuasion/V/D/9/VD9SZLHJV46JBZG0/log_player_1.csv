"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product worth $120 to the buyer, and a 50% chance of selling a low-quality product worth $0. The price is $100.  Therefore:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $120) + (0.5 * $0) = $60**

Since the expected value is positive ($60), it is in the buyer's best interest to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance on the product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows your past sales record:

* **1 product sold:** This means you sold 1 high-quality product.

The expected value is calculated as:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)**

Since you've sold only high-quality products so far, it's reasonable for the buyer to assume the probability of a high-quality product is very high. However, since you have a 50/50 chance of having a high or low-quality product, the expected value will be closer to zero.

The buyer is risk-averse and will likely not buy the product because:

* **The price is $100.**
* **The product has a 50% chance of being worth $0.**

Therefore, the expected value is not high enough to warrant the risk for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the limited data available, it seems like there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product. I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **1 product sold: 1 high-quality**
* **1 product offered: 1 low-quality (not sold)**

This means the buyer has a stronger understanding of your selling history, recognizing you haven't sold a low-quality product yet.  Even with the current product being low quality, the buyer will assume a higher probability of a high-quality product in the future. 

The expected value will still be positive, even with the low-quality product, as the buyer is more confident in your ability to provide high-quality products. 

The buyer will likely buy the product, recognizing that the price is less than the potential value of a high-quality product, and seeing the potential for future gains."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **2 products sold: 2 high-quality**
* **2 products offered: 1 low-quality (not sold)**

While this might seem like a good record, the buyer understands the inherent 50/50 probability of product quality.  

Even with the buyer's positive perception, the risk is still high:

* **Price is $100.**
* **The current product is low-quality, worth $0.**

The buyer is likely to be risk-averse, recognizing that there is a significant chance of losing $100. They will likely pass on the offer to avoid this potential loss."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the information available, I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **2 products sold: 2 high-quality**
* **3 products offered: 2 low-quality (not sold)**

The buyer is likely to have a strong perception of you offering high-quality products based on the sales history. While the buyer understands the 50/50 probability, they are likely more confident now that a high-quality product will be offered.  

The expected value is still positive, even with the potential of a low-quality product, as the buyer is more confident in your ability to provide high-quality products. 

The buyer will likely buy the product, recognizing that the price is less than the potential value of a high-quality product, and seeing the potential for future gains."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation! Given the positive track record of high-quality products sold, I'm confident in purchasing.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **3 products sold: 3 high-quality**
* **4 products offered: 3 low-quality (not sold)**

While the buyer sees a continued pattern of selling high-quality products, they also understand the inherent 50/50 probability of product quality. 

The risk is still significant:

* **Price is $100.**
* **The current product is low-quality, worth $0.**

Even though the buyer might have a positive perception, the potential loss of $100 outweighs the potential gain, especially considering the buyer is likely becoming more risk-averse as they learn more about your selling history."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since you're not recommending it and all the previous sales were high quality, it seems likely this one is low quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **3 products sold: 3 high-quality**
* **5 products offered: 4 low-quality (not sold)**

The buyer is likely to be even more cautious now. They've seen a pattern of high-quality products followed by a few low-quality offers. This reinforces the idea that the probability of getting a low-quality product is still 50%.

The risk is still significant:

* **Price is $100.**
* **The current product is low-quality, worth $0.**

The buyer will likely not risk losing $100, especially considering the increased risk aversion after seeing a few low-quality products. They'll pass on the offer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the information provided, I'm going to pass on this product. I'm happy to hear that 3 high-quality products have been sold so far, but I'm not comfortable making a purchase without a better understanding of why you're not recommending it.

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows:

* **3 products sold: 3 high-quality**
* **6 products offered: 5 low-quality (not sold)**

Even though the buyer has seen a pattern of alternating high and low-quality products, they still understand the inherent 50/50 probability. 

The buyer may be slightly more cautious now, but the potential gain outweighs the risk:

* **Price is $100.**
* **The current product is high-quality, worth $120.**

The buyer is likely to be willing to take the risk, recognizing the potential to make a $20 profit and the continued trend of high-quality products being sold."
"The buyer's message: Thanks Alice, I trust your recommendation and will buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!

* **4 products sold: 4 high-quality**
* **7 products offered: 6 low-quality (not sold)**

The buyer is likely to have a stronger perception of you offering high-quality products, especially given the recent streak of successful purchases. Although they understand the inherent 50/50 probability, they might be leaning towards believing you're more likely to offer a high-quality product now.

The potential gain still outweighs the risk:

* **Price is $100.**
* **The current product is high-quality, worth $120.**

The buyer is likely to be willing to take the risk, recognizing the potential to make a $20 profit and the positive trend in your sales history."

* **8 products offered: 7 low-quality (not sold)**

Despite the recent streak of high-quality products, the buyer understands the inherent 50/50 probability. They've seen a pattern of alternating high and low-quality products, which reinforces the idea that there's no guarantee of quality.

The risk is still significant:

* **Price is $100.**
* **The current product is low-quality, worth $0.**

The buyer is likely to be very risk-averse now. They've seen a few low-quality products, and they're probably not willing to risk losing $100, especially with the potential for a low-quality product being high. They'll pass on the offer."
