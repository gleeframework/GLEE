,,Alice,6,no,

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still low based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous products were low-quality, so I'm taking a chance that this one might be high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low.
