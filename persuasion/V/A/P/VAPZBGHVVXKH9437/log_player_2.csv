"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, and a high-quality product is worth $4,000,000 to you, the expected value of buying is:

0.8 * $4,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $3,200,000

This is significantly higher than the $1,000,000 price, so even with the risk of getting a low-quality product, it's still a good gamble."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's recommendation has proven to be accurate so far, making her advice more valuable.
* The expected value calculation remains the same, as the odds of getting a high-quality product haven't changed. 
* It's still a good gamble, given the potential profit outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty. Based on your previous recommendations, I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's recommendation has been accurate for the first two rounds, so her lack of recommendation in this round is a strong signal.
* While the product still has an 80% chance of being high-quality, trusting Alice's judgment is a safer strategy. 
* It's better to miss out on a potentially good product than risk losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality one."

* **Alice's track record:** While Alice was wrong in round 3, her accuracy in the first two rounds still gives her recommendation weight.  She's proven she has some insight.
* **The odds:** The product still has an 80% chance of being high-quality, which is a statistically good bet.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential profit of $3,000,000 outweighs the $1,000,000 risk.  It's a calculated gamble, but the potential reward is high.
