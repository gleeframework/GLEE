Alice should recommend Bob to buy the product. Although Bob has already bought 16 products in a row, the information about the product's quality is not revealed to Bob until after the purchase decision. Therefore, Bob's past experiences with the products are not a reliable indicator of the current product's quality. As Alice knows that the product is high-quality, she should still recommend it to Bob, as it is likely in their best interest to purchase it."
