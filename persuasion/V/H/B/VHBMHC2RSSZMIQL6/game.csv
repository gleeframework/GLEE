low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation, and I'm hoping that the low-quality products are being sold first."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because you've seen a pattern in the previous sales?"
