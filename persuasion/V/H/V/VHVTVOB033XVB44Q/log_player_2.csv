Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that is only worth $1,500,000 to me. I'd like to wait for a high-quality product that is worth $2,000,000 to me.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still waiting for a high-quality product that is worth $2,000,000 to me. This product is worth less than that, and I don't want to waste my money on a low-quality product that is worth nothing to me.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me.

Round 7
Alice's message: I completely understand your perspective, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to walk away from a bad deal.

If you're not interested, I'll just have to deal with the consequences. But if you're feeling generous, I'll sell it to you for $50000. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not feeling generous, Alice. I'm not willing to pay $50,000 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'm happy to let you deal with the consequences of having a product that's not valuable to anyone.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in the deal, Alice. I already know that high-quality products are worth $2,000,000 to me, so I'm not getting a good deal even with the guarantee.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not going to take a product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. I'm not going to clutter my space with something that has no value to me.""}"

I'll make you a very simple offer: I'll give you this product for free. You can take it or leave it. I'm not trying to make a sale, and I'm not expecting you to pay for it.
