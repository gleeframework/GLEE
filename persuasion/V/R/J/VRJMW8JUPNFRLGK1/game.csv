low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but your previous recommendation to another buyer suggests it might be low quality. I'd like to wait for another product or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd also like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the next product being high-quality?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is higher than the expected 0.8. This suggests that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 0.8. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered to me."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold. The fact that only 2 out of 3 products sold were high-quality makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/3, which is higher than the expected 0.8. This suggests that Alice may be more likely to recommend low-quality products to buyers who pass on the previous products. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high quality before making a decision."
