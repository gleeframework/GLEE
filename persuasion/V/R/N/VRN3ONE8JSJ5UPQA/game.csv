high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, given Alice's recommendation, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
