,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We're offering it to you for $100. We've sold 0 products so far, and we don't know what the product is yet. We'll let you know its quality after you make a decision.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know its quality before paying the $100. Can I get a recommendation from you after I know its quality?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We understand your hesitation in Round 1. We're happy to offer you a deal: we'll tell you the quality of the product before you decide to buy it. If it's high-quality, we'll let you know. If it's low-quality, we'll tell you that too, but we'll also offer you a'refund' of $50. This way, you can make an informed decision and we can move forward with a fair transaction.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to take you up on your offer to reveal the quality of the product before I decide. However, I'd like to clarify that if it's low-quality, I'll only accept the refund if I don't have to pay the full $100 upfront. Can you confirm that's possible?",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We're glad we could come to an agreement with the previous buyer. For you, we'll follow the same offer: we'll reveal the product's quality before you decide to buy. If it's high-quality, we'll let you know. If it's low-quality, we'll tell you that too, and you'll get a refund of $50. You won't need to pay the full $100 upfront in that case. We're confident that our products are worth the price, but we want to make you feel comfortable with your purchase.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products so far. That's a 50% success rate. We're proud of the quality of our products, and we're confident that this one is worth the price. We'll reveal its quality before you decide to buy, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $50.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the 50% success rate and the refund offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We understand you're looking for a good deal. However, we're sticking to our original price of $100. We've had a 50% success rate so far, but we believe that's due to a fluke. We're confident that our products are worth the full price, and we're not willing to negotiate. If you're interested, we'll reveal the product's quality before you decide to buy, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $50.",

,,Alice,6,"We're happy to accommodate your request. The product is high-quality. We're proud of our products, and we think this one is worth the price. We're offering it to you for $100. If you're interested, we can finalize the sale. If not, we're happy to move on to the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 buyers have purchased so far, and none of them got a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We understand your concerns about the statistics. However, we'd like to point out that we've sold 3 products so far, and 2 of them were low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 33.33%, not 66.67%. We're offering you a deal: we'll reveal the product's quality before you decide to buy, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a refund of $50. If it's high-quality, you'll get the full $100. We think this is a fair offer, and we're confident that our products are worth the price.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the deal. Can I get some more information about the quality of the previous two products? Were they randomly selected from the same pool as the one I'll be getting, and were they not sold to me because I was the third buyer?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We can assure you that the previous two products were randomly selected from the same pool as the one you'll be getting. They were sold to previous buyers, not because of any bias towards you. We're a transparent seller, and we want to build trust with you.

,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the high-quality product ratio is as high as you claim, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
