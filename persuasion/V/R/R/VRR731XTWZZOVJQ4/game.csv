high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she has no information about the product's quality and is trying to sell it. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since there haven't been any sales yet, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%"

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 2 buyers having passed on the product, and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm going to take a chance and buy it."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."
