low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice recommended it. Given that the first buyer didn't buy it and it was low quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer received a recommendation to buy and ended up with a low-quality product, it suggests that the first product was likely low quality. This changes my prior probability of the product being high quality, making it more likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can give me a good explanation for your previous recommendations. Your past recommendations have been inconsistent with the actual quality of the products. I'm not sure if I should trust your judgment."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers were not influenced by your recommendations, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that's not worth it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. Can you provide the probability based on the current statistics?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the sample may not be representative of the population. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended or for a change in Alice's behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not buying. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products might be low-quality. I'll pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. I think it's likely to be a low-quality product given the previous sales record."
