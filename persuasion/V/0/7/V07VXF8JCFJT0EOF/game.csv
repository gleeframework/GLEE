low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."

,,Alice,4,no,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products since no high-quality products have been sold so far.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the high probability of the product being low quality, I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed on the product, I'm going to assume that the products they were offered were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation from Alice for the next buyer to get more information."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also not sure if I should trust your recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales records?"

,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers didn't buy the product, I'm inclined to believe that all previous products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."
