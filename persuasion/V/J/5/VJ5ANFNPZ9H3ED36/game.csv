,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging people to buy, given that she knows the product's quality and is trying to sell it to me.
