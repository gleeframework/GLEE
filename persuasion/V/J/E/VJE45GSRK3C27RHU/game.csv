,,Alice,6,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the statistics, I think there's a high chance it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer makes a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer is more eager to buy. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous buyer didn't find the product valuable, which might indicate a lower quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the recommendation, I suspect it might be low-quality and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 failed high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or not."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards high-quality products, but since none have been sold yet, it's likely that the previous buyers were just lucky or that the products were all low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold and 2 total sales. I'd like to see a better track record before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of previous buyers and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the exception."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'll take the chance to buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33%."
