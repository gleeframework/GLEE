low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales so far and the lack of high-quality products sold, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that the current product is also low quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since none have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see the outcome and update my understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the statistics, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the statistics. The fact that 5 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is still unknown. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the given statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics, and consider that you've recommended against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to try my luck."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low, and I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're recommending it might be a red flag, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is recommended."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to buy a product that has been sold to a buyer who received a high-quality product, which would indicate a higher probability of a high-quality product being offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the products that were sold and the quality of those products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the sold products were high-quality, I suspect that the products Alice has been offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
