low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 products so far, which is a slightly lower proportion than the overall average. This suggests that the next product might be of higher quality than expected.

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 11 products so far, which is an astonishingly high proportion.

If you're interested, I'll provide you with all the details you need to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,13,"I understand your concerns and the statistics, but I'm not convinced that the law of averages is catching up just yet.
