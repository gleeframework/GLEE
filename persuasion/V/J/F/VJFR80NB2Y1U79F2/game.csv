,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, I'm not convinced it's worth the $100 based on your previous recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't change my decision, but I'm curious about the product's quality."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100, which is the price you're asking for. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because you're not recommending it, not because I have any information about the product's quality. I'm hoping that the low quality product rate is higher than the reported 66.67%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were not recommended to buy, and none of them were high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance. I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality given the previous 6 buyers have all passed on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure what your recommendation criteria are, but I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product. I'll just have to rely on my own judgment and the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 8 buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 9 buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and not worth the $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is suspicious. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that it's unlikely."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, I notice that none of the previous 11 buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products were sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'm not confident in the product and will pass on it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the overall quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you would buy it instead."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which indicate a low proportion of high-quality products sold. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 12, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not to buy."
