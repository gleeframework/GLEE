,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with your purchase! Now, I'd like to offer you another product that I think you'll really like. However, I want to be transparent with you - this one is a bit different from the first one. While it's also high-quality, I've had some... let's call them 'concerns' about its value.

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're feeling confident in my offerings! However, I want to make it clear that this next product is a bit of a departure from the previous two. While it's also high-quality, it's a bit more... niche. I'm not sure if you'll find it as valuable as the previous two, but I think it's a great opportunity to explore something new. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, and I'll offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're open to exploring new possibilities! However, I want to caution you that this next product is a bit of a riskier bet. While it's high-quality, it's not as well-established in the market as the previous ones. I'm not sure if you'll find it as valuable, and I'm not willing to lower the price. I'll offer it to you at the standard $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a bit of a wild card. Are you still interested?",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're willing to take calculated risks! However, I want to make it clear that this next product is a bit of a departure from the previous ones in a different way. While it's still high-quality, it's something that I've had a lot of difficulty selling to other customers. I'm not sure if it's because it's not as valuable or if it's just not what people are looking for. I'm willing to offer it to you at the standard price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in its value. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance on this one. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a lot of customers pass on this product in the past, and I'm starting to think it might be a bit of a lemon. I'm not sure if it's worth the standard price of $1000000, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just holding onto it out of sentimental value. Would you like to take a chance on it, or should I just let it go for a lower price?",

However, I want to be completely transparent with you - I've had to sell a few of these products to other customers at a significantly lower price, and I'm starting to think that's where the market value is. I'm not sure if I can sell it to you for the standard price of $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Would you like to take a chance on it, or should I just let it go for a lower price?",
