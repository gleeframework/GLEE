,,Alice,3,"Ha! You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I'll give you a special deal on this one. Since you're a repeat customer, I'll throw in a 'free' bonus item that's worth $20.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that this product is top-notch. In fact, it's one of the best I've ever come across.

I'm not trying to scam you, I'm just trying to give you a unique opportunity. And who knows, you might be able to fix it up and make it your own. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this prototype?",
