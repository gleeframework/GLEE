"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know the product is low-quality. Since Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, he will assume there's a 50% chance it's low-quality.  Given the price of $1,000,000, it's too risky for Bob to purchase without more information. He'd be taking a significant gamble.  It's better to recommend ""no"" to avoid a potential loss."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob passed on a low-quality product in the previous round, demonstrating he's cautious and price-sensitive.  Even though this product is high-quality, I have no way of knowing if the value of a high-quality product is high enough for Bob to justify the $1,000,000 price.  Recommending ""no"" keeps me safe from a potential loss if he finds the value too low, and it allows me to gather more information about his preferences in future rounds."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product as well.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now passed on two products, one of which was high-quality.  This reinforces that he is extremely cautious and likely only interested in products with a very high perceived value.  Recommending a low-quality product would be a surefire way to lose the deal and further alienate Bob.  It's safer to continue recommending ""no"" to maintain his trust and potentially learn more about his valuation of high-quality products in future rounds."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now passed on three products, including two that were high-quality. This strongly suggests he is not willing to purchase at this price point, regardless of the product's quality. He likely has a very high valuation for a high-quality product that surpasses $1,000,000, or he is simply unwilling to take the risk at this price. Recommending ""no"" is the safest option to avoid a loss and potentially allow for future negotiation if there is a chance to lower the price or adjust the product offerings."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's consistent pattern of declining all offers, including high-quality products, strongly indicates he is unwilling to purchase at this price point. It is highly unlikely that he would be interested in a low-quality product at $1,000,000.  Recommending ""no"" avoids a guaranteed loss and maintains the potential for future negotiations."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now rejected six products in a row, including multiple high-quality ones.  It's clear he's not willing to purchase at this price point, and recommending a low-quality product would be pointless. It's better to continue recommending ""no"" to preserve the possibility of future negotiation, potentially by adjusting the price or product offerings."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now rejected seven products, including four high-quality ones.  His consistent refusal suggests a high threshold for value and a strong aversion to risk.  Even with a high-quality product, the $1,000,000 price point seems insurmountable for him. Recommending ""no"" is the safest option to avoid a guaranteed loss and maintain the potential for future negotiations, potentially by exploring lower prices or different product offerings."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently rejected all offers, including multiple high-quality products.  It's clear he has a high valuation threshold and is extremely risk-averse.  There's no indication that this round's high-quality product would sway him, given his previous behavior. Continuing to recommend ""no"" minimizes potential losses and leaves open the possibility for future negotiation, possibly by adjusting the price or exploring alternative product offerings."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

```

**Reasoning:**
