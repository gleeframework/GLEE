"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the price is fixed and Alice knows the value of each product to you, her recommendation is valuable information. If she recommends buying, it's likely the product is high quality, as she wouldn't recommend a product that would result in you losing money. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy as Alice could be intentionally trying to get you to buy a low-quality product. However, it's the best option given the information available at this point."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has successfully recommended two high-quality products in a row.
