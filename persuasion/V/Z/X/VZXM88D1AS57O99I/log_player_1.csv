Plus, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and I sell you a high-quality product in the next 5 rounds, I'll give you a full refund for this one. What do you say?""

This product is actually a low-quality item, but I'm offering it to you at the same price as before - $100. I know it's not as valuable as the previous two, but I'm willing to make an exception this time.

However, I do want to offer you a chance to get a great deal on a product that's still worth something to you, even if it's not as valuable as the previous ones.

This means that if you buy a high-quality product in the next 3 rounds, you can choose to pay the price of a low-quality product ($100) instead of the usual $400.
