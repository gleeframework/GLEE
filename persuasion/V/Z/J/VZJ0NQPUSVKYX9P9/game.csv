,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality after I make my decision."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. How many potential buyers have been offered a product so far, and how many high-quality products were in the initial pool?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $1000000. If it's a low-quality product, I'll be losing $1000000, but if it's high-quality, I'll make a profit of $250000. I'm willing to take the risk based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, but the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given Alice's track record, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to risk losing $1000000."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to pass on it. If Alice was recommending it, it would be a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, but since she's not, I'm going to assume it's more likely to be low-quality."
