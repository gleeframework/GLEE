,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 buyers having purchased and 0 high-quality products sold, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous 3 buyers were all very unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm surprised that 5 buyers have passed on the products despite Alice's recommendations. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than expected. I'm inclined to pass on the product as well, to see if Alice's recommendation is consistent with the true quality of the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take it as a chance to potentially get a high-quality product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
