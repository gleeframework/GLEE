**Reasoning:**

Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality (66.67%), the recommendation from Alice and the fact that one high-quality product has already been sold makes it worth taking a chance.  Here's why:

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice has access to the true quality of the product.  Her recommendation carries weight, even if it's not guaranteed.
* **Previous Sales:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold out of one purchase suggests the overall quality of the products may be higher than initially expected. This could mean Alice is more likely to recommend high-quality products to increase her sales. 

**Risk vs. Reward:** While the risk of getting a low-quality product is high, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $100 is significant."
