}"
"The buyer's message: I've noticed that the statistics you provided seem inconsistent. You mentioned that you've sold 3 high-quality products out of 14, but then stated that out of 12 products, 8 were low-quality and 4 were high-quality. These numbers don't match, and I'm not convinced by your claim of a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. Given the initial condition that each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that probability over your statement. Therefore, I'm not willing to buy the product at this time.

}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. The fact that you've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 16 doesn't give me much confidence.
