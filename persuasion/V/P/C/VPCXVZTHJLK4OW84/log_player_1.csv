It's a true work of art, and I'm not just saying that because I'm trying to sell it to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price as before - $1000000 - because I truly believe it's worth it. But, I'll make you a deal. If you're willing to take a chance on this product, I'll throw in a personalized certificate of authenticity, signed by the artisan themselves. What do you say?""}"

It's still a high-quality product, but it's not as rare or unique as the last one. It's still worth $1000000, but I'm willing to make a concession. I'll give you a 5% discount on this one.
