,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current statistics and Alice's recommendation.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous two buyers were recommended to buy but didn't find any high-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics.

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, which might suggest that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality."
