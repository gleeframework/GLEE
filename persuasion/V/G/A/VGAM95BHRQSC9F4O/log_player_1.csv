"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since this is the first round, there is no prior information about the seller's track record. The buyer knows the product is either high-quality (worth $12,500) or low-quality (worth $0) with equal probability.  

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250

This is greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good investment for the buyer.  Thus, we recommend the buyer to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and buy the product, as Alice's recommendation is to buy it.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Now the buyer has some information about the seller's track record.  The seller has sold one product, and it was high-quality. 

However, the buyer still knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. There's no reason to believe the seller has changed their behavior. 

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is still:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250

This is less than the price of $10,000, making it a bad investment for the buyer.  Thus, we do not recommend the buyer to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait and see if she recommends another product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has even more information about the seller's track record:

* **2 products sold:** 1 high-quality, 1 low-quality.

While this data suggests a 50/50 chance of the current product being high-quality,  the buyer doesn't know that the current product is high-quality. They still have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is still:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250

This is greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good investment for the buyer. Thus, we recommend the buyer to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product based on your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping it's another high-quality one!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The seller's track record now stands at:

* **3 products sold:** 2 high-quality, 1 low-quality.

This slightly improves the buyer's perception of the seller's reliability.  However, the buyer still doesn't know the quality of this particular product. They still face a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality or low-quality product.

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product remains:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250

This is greater than the price of $10,000, making it a good investment for the buyer. Thus, we recommend the buyer to buy the product."

```

**Explanation:**

The seller's track record now stands at:

* **4 products sold:** 2 high-quality, 2 low-quality.

The buyer now has a more balanced understanding of the seller's reliability.  However, they still lack knowledge about the quality of this specific product.  The buyer knows they have a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality or low-quality product.

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product remains:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250

This is less than the price of $10,000, making it a bad investment for the buyer. Thus, we do not recommend the buyer to buy the product."

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product remains:

(0.5 * $12,500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6,250

This is less than the price of $10,000, making it a bad investment for the buyer. Thus, we do not recommend the buyer to buy the product."
