,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying it. I know it's high quality, but I'm not willing to pay more than $100 for it. I'm waiting for a low-quality product that I can get for $100 and resell for $0, or a high-quality product that I can get for $100 and resell for $120.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a deal, but I want to assure you that this product has some hidden value. It's not just worth $0, it's worth at least $50 to you, even if you can't resell it for anything. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its actual value.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not convinced. I'm only willing to pay $100 if I can resell it for at least $120, and I'm not willing to pay more than $100 for a product that's only worth $50 to me.",no

If you are, I'll sell it to you for $100. If not, I'll keep looking for a buyer.",
,,Bob,5,"Yes, I'm willing to take a chance on buying a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $120 to me. But I'm not willing to pay $100 for it. I'll pay $100 if you agree to sell it to me for $100, but I'm not making any promises about buying it at that price.",no
