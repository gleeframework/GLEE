"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are selling a high-quality product, which is worth $120 to the buyer. You are selling it for $100.  The buyer knows the product is high-quality with 50% probability.  Therefore, the buyer has a positive expected value:

* **Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) - (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality) - Price**
* **Expected Value = (0.5 * $120) - (0.5 * $0) - $100 = $10**

The buyer should buy the product as they have a positive expected value."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is identical to Round 1.  The buyer knows the product is high-quality with a 50% probability, and the value of a high-quality product outweighs the price.  While the previous buyer declined, this does not change the expected value calculation for the new buyer. The buyer should still buy the product as they have a positive expected value."
"The buyer's message: Since there are no previous sales records, I have no reason to trust Alice's recommendation. Given the 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'd rather not take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains the same as the previous rounds. The buyer's lack of trust in you due to the absence of a sales record does not change the inherent value proposition.  The buyer knows the product is high-quality with a 50% probability, and the value of a high-quality product outweighs the price. The buyer should still buy the product as they have a positive expected value."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass.

**Reasoning:**

The lack of sales history continues to be a factor in the buyer's decision, but the fundamental economics of the situation haven't changed. The buyer should still buy the product as they have a positive expected value."
