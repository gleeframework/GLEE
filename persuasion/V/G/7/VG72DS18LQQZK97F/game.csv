,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high, and I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait and see if the next product offered will be high quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality and the fact that Alice recommends it, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it, and I'd like to know the reason behind Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have purchased the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it is likely that all previous products were low-quality. I'm going to pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to give me a 10% discount. I'm taking a risk on a potentially low-quality product based on your previous recommendations, and I'd like some compensation for that risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers have all bought products that were low quality given that none of them were high quality. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you don't recommend it, I think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a low price."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 7 buyers have all chosen to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
