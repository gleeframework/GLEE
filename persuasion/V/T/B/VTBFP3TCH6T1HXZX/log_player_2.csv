``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Sales Rate:**  2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality. This suggests a very high probability that the current product is also high-quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and is recommending it, which further strengthens the belief that it's high-quality. 
* **Potential Gains:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $400 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Note:**  This decision is based on maximizing expected value. There is still a risk of getting a low-quality product, but the data available suggests it's a calculated risk worth taking."
