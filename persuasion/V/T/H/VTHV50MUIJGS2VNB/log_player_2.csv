**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. This means she knows the product is high-quality. Since Alice is honest and knows the value of the product to you, her recommendation is valuable information.
* **Statistics:** The statistics show a 100% success rate of high-quality products sold so far. This strengthens the likelihood of the current product also being high-quality.
* **Expected Value:** Even considering the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive:
    * 80% chance of getting a $120 product = $96
    * 20% chance of getting a $0 product = $0
    * Expected value = 0.8 * $120 + 0.2 * $0 = $96
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product, even though there is a small risk."

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Sales Record:** 7 buyers, 6 high-quality products sold. This means the seller has a 6/7 = 85.7% success rate in selling high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation carries significant weight.
* **Decision:** Based on the high success rate and Alice's recommendation, it's reasonable to assume the current product is likely high quality.  Therefore, the decision is to buy. 

**Note:** While the initial probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the information from previous sales and Alice's recommendation drastically increase the perceived likelihood of a high-quality product."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** With 17 out of 19 buyers purchasing high-quality products, the seller's recommendation seems highly accurate. 
* **Limited Risk:** Even if the current product is low quality (which is a 20% chance), the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

**Note:** This response assumes the buyer is risk-neutral and prioritizes the potential gain of a high-quality product."
