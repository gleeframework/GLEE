low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to buy, it's possible that the product is of high quality.

I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that she didn't recommend it might actually increase the chances of it being high-quality."
