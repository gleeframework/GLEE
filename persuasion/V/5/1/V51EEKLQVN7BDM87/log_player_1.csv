As for this next product, I'm confident that it's also high-quality, but I'll be honest with you - the probability of it being low-quality is 50%, just like all my products. However, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to'split the risk' with me.

This means my expected value would be ($20000 * 0.5) + ($5000 * 0.5) = $15000. This is higher than the initial price of $10000, so I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product.
