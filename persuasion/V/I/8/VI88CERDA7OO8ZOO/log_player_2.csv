"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice doesn't know the value of the product to you, her recommendation is essentially a coin flip. It's better to take the chance and buy the product. Even though there's a higher chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of getting a high-quality product at a bargain price is worth the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. I'll keep an eye out for your next offering.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a signal. Since she doesn't know the value of the product to you, her recommendation against buying suggests it is likely low-quality. While there's still a chance it's high-quality, the risk is too high. It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one again. I've noticed a pattern in your recommendations, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation pattern is starting to emerge. She has recommended against buying twice in a row, which reinforces the idea that she is likely signaling low-quality products. While there is still a chance this product is high-quality, it's not worth the risk of losing $10,000.  Passing is the safest option in this situation."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. I've noticed a pattern in your recommendations, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk. I'll keep an eye out for your next offering.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now recommended against buying for three consecutive rounds. This strongly suggests she is signaling low-quality products, and even though there's still a chance this one is high-quality, the risk is too high. It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's track record of recommending against buying has been consistent, the previous round showed that she can be wrong. However, the potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $2,500.  It's still too risky to buy based on Alice's recommendations alone.  It's better to wait for a clearer signal or a recommendation in favor of buying."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now recommended against buying for six rounds in a row. This pattern strongly suggests she is signaling low-quality products. Even though there's a chance this product is high-quality, it's a risk not worth taking given the potential loss of $10,000.  It's better to wait for a more promising opportunity or a change in Alice's recommendation behavior."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

```

**Reasoning:**
