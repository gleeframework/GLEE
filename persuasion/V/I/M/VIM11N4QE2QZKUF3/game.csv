However, I'd like to remind you of the exclusive update I offered earlier, which will give you a better understanding of our product line after the next 5 sales. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, while I appreciate your optimism, the statistics show that only 1 out of 2 buyers bought your products. This makes me doubt the quality of the products. Furthermore, you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, even though you claim to have 3. I'm not confident about the quality of the current product and will pass on it.  I'll wait for the next 5 sales data to make a decision. Thanks for the offer.",no
