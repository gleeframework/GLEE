A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about the seller's past performance. The seller states the product is high-quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there is no reason to suspect the seller is lying. Therefore, it's in the buyer's best interest to buy the product, as there is a 50% chance it will be worth more than the $1,000,000 price."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no prior information, I'm willing to take the 50/50 risk. I'll buy the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The seller has a 100% success rate, but that's based on a very small sample size. It's highly unlikely the seller will continue to have a 100% success rate. The seller's claim of a high-quality product is suspect, as there is a 50% chance the product is actually low-quality. With a 1,000,000 dollar price tag, the potential for loss outweighs the potential gain. Therefore, it is not recommended to purchase this product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I will pass on this product. I'm a bit hesitant given the fact that you are not recommending it and the price seems high given the risk of getting a low-quality product.
