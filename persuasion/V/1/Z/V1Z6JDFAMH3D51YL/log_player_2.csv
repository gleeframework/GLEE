**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** There's only one sale recorded, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough information to confidently determine the quality of the current product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While Alice's recommendation is a factor, it's important to remember she doesn't know the actual quality of the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $12,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if it's low quality).  Since there's a 50/50 chance, it's a gamble worth taking. 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified scenario. In real-world scenarios, buyers would consider factors like the seller's reputation, product reviews, and other available information before making a decision."
