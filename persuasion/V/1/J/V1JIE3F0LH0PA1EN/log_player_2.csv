You might be wondering if there's a pattern to my pitches or if I'm just trying to make each product sound appealing. I assure you, my goal is to provide useful information, even if it's indirect.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to acknowledge my skepticism and to be more transparent about your approach.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to experiment. I'm not sure I'm ready to buy a product without any new information, even if it's a 50/50 chance. I'm more interested in seeing how your proposed experiment works out.
