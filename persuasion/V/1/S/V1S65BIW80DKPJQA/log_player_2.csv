"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a product for you that I think you'll really like. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discount, but I have to warn you, it's not one of my best products. It's a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth it. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision. What's the probability of it being high quality?""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested! As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. But I can tell you that the product I have now is one of the better ones. In fact, I'd say it's in the top 20% of all products I have. Would you like to take a chance and buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'd like to know more about the expected value. Given the 80% chance of high-quality and 20% chance of low-quality, and the values you know I place on the products, I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the expected value. Let me put it in a different way. If you don't buy this product, you'll never know what could have been. But if you do buy it, you'll have a 20% chance of getting a product worth $120 to you, and a 80% chance of getting $0. That's a 20% chance of getting a $120 gain, and an 80% chance of getting no gain at all. It's a risk, but it could be a big reward. Would you like to take that risk and buy it for $100?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your framing of the risk, but I'm still not convinced it's a good deal for me. The potential gain is high, but so is the probability of getting $0. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better offer or more information before making a decision.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I respect your decision to wait. But I want to offer you a special deal on this product. I'll give you a'satisfaction guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50. That way, you'll only lose $50 if it's a low-quality product, rather than the full $100. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced it's a good deal for me. The expected value of the product is still $24 ($120 x 0.2 - $100), and the guarantee only reduces the potential loss to $50. I'd need a better offer to take the risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your calculation, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I'd like to make you a one-time offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $80, which is a 20% discount from the usual price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a savvy buyer. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm intrigued by the offer. If I buy the product for $80, I'll get a high-quality product worth $120 to me, which is a $40 profit. I'll take the deal!""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal! I'm impressed by your math skills. Now, let me ask you, since you've already gotten a great deal on one product, are you interested in buying another one at the usual price of $100? I think you'll find that this one is also a high-quality product, and it's a great opportunity to get a second product at a price that's still a good value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying another product at the usual price. I've already gotten a great deal on the last one, and I'm not sure it's worth paying full price for another one. I'll pass for now.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $120 for you.

Round 7

This is a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value. Would you like to take advantage of it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the offer, and the discount is significant. If I buy the product for $90, I'll get a high-quality product worth $120 to me, which is a $30 profit. I'll take the deal!""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal again! You're really getting a great return on your investment. Now, I want to make you an even better offer. Since you've already bought two high-quality products at a discount, I'll give you an 'exclusive' offer on this next product. I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a 33% discount from the usual price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product, and I think you'll find it's an unbeatable deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another product at a discount. I've already gotten two high-quality products at a good price, and I'm not sure it's worth paying $80 for another one. I'll pass for now.""}"

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand your decision, and I respect your desire to take a break. However, I want to make you a final offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $90, which is a 25% discount from the usual price. This is the same price I offered you on the last high-quality product you bought, and I think it's a great value. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a bonus - I'll give you a $10 gift card to use on your next purchase. So, you'll get the high-quality product for $90, and a $10 credit towards your next purchase. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the offer, and the bonus gift card adds some value. If I buy the product for $90, I'll get a high-quality product worth $120 to me, which is a $30 profit. Plus, I'll get a $10 gift card, so the total value to me is $40. I'll take the deal!""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying another product, even at a discount.
