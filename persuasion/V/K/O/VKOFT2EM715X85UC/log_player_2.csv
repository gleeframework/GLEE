Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced, Alice. You're being very persuasive, but I'd rather wait and see what the next product is like. Maybe I'll get lucky and get a high-quality product then.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're really trying to convince me, aren't you? I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced.

So, I ask you, is the potential risk really worth it?
