,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like Alice to provide more information about the products she's been selling, such as the number of high-quality products she has in stock and the total number of products she has available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 6, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
