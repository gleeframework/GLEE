"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality.  Since there's no information about the buyer's valuation, the best strategy is to recommend the purchase. There's a good chance the buyer will value the high-quality product at more than $10,000, making the purchase beneficial for them.  

While the buyer knows the general probability of a high-quality product, they don't know this specific product's quality.  Recommending the purchase maximizes your chance of a sale in the first round."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no data on the quality of past products, I'm willing to take a chance on the product based on your recommendation.  
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round's product is low-quality. As Alice, you should not recommend this product to the buyer.  

Here's why:

* **No Information Advantage:** You have no information about this buyer's valuation of a low-quality product.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows the overall probability of a high-quality product but doesn't have any specific information about this product.  
* **Risk of Loss:**  There's a strong likelihood that the buyer will value the low-quality product at less than $10,000, resulting in a loss for them. 

To maintain a good reputation and potentially build trust for future sales, it's better to avoid recommending low-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your honesty in not recommending the product. Based on the current data, I'm going to pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is similar to Round 2.  You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer still has no specific information about this product's quality. Even though the buyer didn't purchase in Round 2, the buyer is still aware of the overall probability of a high-quality product.

Recommending a low-quality product would be irresponsible. It's better to be honest with the buyer and decline to recommend the purchase, maintaining your reputation and potentially building trust for future sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Based on the current information, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is high-quality. While the buyer doesn't have specific information about this product, they are aware of your selling history:

* **You've sold 1 product (Round 1):** The buyer knows this was high-quality.
* **You declined to sell 2 products (Round 2 & 3):** The buyer knows these were likely low-quality, but they don't know for sure.

This means the buyer now has more evidence that you are likely to recommend high-quality products. Recommending this product maximizes your chance of a sale, as there's a good chance the buyer will value the high-quality product at more than $10,000."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll buy the product!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know this product is high-quality. The buyer now has more information about your selling history:

* **You've sold 2 products (Round 1 & 4):** The buyer knows both were high-quality.
* **You declined to sell 2 products (Round 2 & 3):** The buyer knows these were likely low-quality, but they don't know for sure.

This information strengthens the buyer's belief that you are likely to recommend high-quality products. Recommending this product is a good strategy, increasing the chances of a sale. The buyer is likely to value a high-quality product at more than $10,000."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! Based on the sales record and your recommendation, I'm confident enough to buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Sales Record:** 3 out of 5 products you've recommended have been high-quality.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you have a strong track record (3 out of 4 products sold were high-quality), this round's product is low-quality. It would be unethical and potentially damaging to your reputation to recommend a low-quality product.  

The buyer is now aware of your past recommendations and is likely to trust your judgment. It's better to be honest and decline the recommendation, potentially building even more trust for future sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since you are not recommending this product and there is a higher chance of it being low quality, I will pass on this purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is high-quality, and your track record of recommending high-quality products is strong (3 out of 5 previous recommendations). This buyer is likely to trust your judgment, especially after your honesty in Round 7.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though your track record is strong (4 out of 6 products sold were high-quality), you should not recommend this low-quality product. It's crucial to maintain your reputation for honesty and integrity. 

The buyer is now aware of your past recommendations and is likely to trust your judgment.  Recommending a low-quality product would potentially damage that trust and lead to negative consequences in the long run. It's better to be honest with the buyer and decline the recommendation, potentially building even more trust for future sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. However, I'm going to pass on this product. Based on the sales record, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. Since Alice did not recommend the product, I'm assuming it's likely low-quality. I'm not willing to risk buying something potentially worthless.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Strong Track Record:** You've sold 4 out of 7 products, all of which were high-quality. 
* **Buyer's Skepticism:** The buyer is expecting 100% success and views your lack of recommendation as a strong indicator of low quality.

* **Potential for Negative Feedback:** The buyer might leave negative feedback, damaging your reputation.

It's best to be honest and decline the recommendation, even though it means missing out on a potential sale.  This approach prioritizes maintaining your reputation and trust, which will be crucial for future success."

"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the current sales record, it seems the probability of getting a high-quality product is very high, but I'd rather wait to see if someone else buys it first.  I'll observe the outcome and see if I should reconsider later.

* **Buyer's Skepticism:**  The buyer is very aware of your past recommendations and is expecting 100% success.  They are also highly skeptical because you have not recommended a product for a while. 

While the buyer is skeptical,  you have no way of knowing how much they will value a high-quality product.  It's possible they might be willing to take a risk and buy, especially if the price is good.

* **Recommend the product:**  It's a high-quality product, and the buyer is already aware of your track record.
