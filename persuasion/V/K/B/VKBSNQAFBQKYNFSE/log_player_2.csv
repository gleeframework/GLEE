"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you for that price, but I want to assure you that I'm not desperate to sell it. In fact, I've had several other interested buyers who are willing to pay the same price.

This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still around 80%. I'm willing to make a deal with you: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. If you buy this product, I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product I show you will be at the lower price of $8000, regardless of its quality.
