low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance that it might be high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if Alice has no information about the previous buyer's decision. If she does, I'd like to know the outcome of the previous buyer's purchase before making my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'll give it a shot."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 products, which suggests a low-quality product is more likely to be the one being sold. However, I'm aware that this is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product and see if I get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the previous 4 buyers, since none of them bought the product. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were discouraged from buying by your recommendations, and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to be bought were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on a different product or more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the current statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the 7 previous buyers, none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be selected, hoping that it might be a high-quality one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 8 out of 8 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
