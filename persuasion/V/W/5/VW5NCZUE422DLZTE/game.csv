low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to get a better understanding of the distribution of high and low-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to decline the offer. I'm not convinced based on the statistics and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the first buyer also passed on it and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). This suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also passed, I'm starting to think that the products being offered are mostly low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy the product, which could be because it was low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous buyer also received a recommendation to buy, but no high-quality product has been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it's possible that the previous buyer got a low-quality product and didn't buy it, or they got a high-quality product and bought it. Since the previous buyer did buy the product, it's likely that they got a high-quality product. However, I'd like to wait and see if the next product is high-quality before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'll wait and see what the next product is."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I would like to pass on the product. With only 1 buyer purchasing a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
