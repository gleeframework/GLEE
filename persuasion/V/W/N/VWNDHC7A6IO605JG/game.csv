,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't take into account the true value of the product to me, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. Based on the given probabilities, I would expect 2 high-quality products out of 4 purchases. Since Alice recommended me to buy the product, it is likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
