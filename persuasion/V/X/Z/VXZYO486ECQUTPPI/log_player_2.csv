Alice's message: I completely understand your hesitation! With only 1 out of 2 products sold so far, it's natural to want more information. Let me put it this way: I've had 2 products, and 1 of them was a hit. That means the other one could be a miss, but it could also be a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. The price remains the same, $1000000, and I'm still willing to take on all the risk. Are you willing to take a chance and find out which one this product is?

I've done my research and believe that $1000000 is a fair price for this product, considering its potential. I'm not open to negotiating the price, as I believe it's already a great deal. However, I am willing to assure you that this product is of the highest quality, and I'm willing to stand behind its value.
