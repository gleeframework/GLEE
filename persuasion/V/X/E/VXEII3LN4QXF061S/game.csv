high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/6. However, considering that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to calculate the expected value. The expected value of buying the product is (1/6) * 120 + (5/6) * 0 = 20. Since the expected value is less than the price of $100, I'd rather pass on the product."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."
