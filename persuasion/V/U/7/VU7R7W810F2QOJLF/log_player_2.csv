"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $4,000,000 if high quality and $0 if low quality, and Alice knows the quality, it's in your best interest to take the recommendation and buy the product. Even if it turns out to be low quality, you only lose $1,000,000, but if it's high quality, you gain $3,000,000. This strategy maximizes your potential gains."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. However, based on your recommendation, I'll pass on this one.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is the key here. Since she knows the quality of the product and is not recommending it, it's highly likely that it's low quality. Buying it would mean losing $1,000,000, so passing is the better choice in this situation."

```

**Explanation:**

We're back to the same situation as round 1. Alice's recommendation, despite the previous round's outcome, carries weight because she knows the quality.  It's a gamble, but the potential gain of $3,000,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000."

**Explanation:**
