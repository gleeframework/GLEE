,,Alice,3,"I've sold two products so far, one of which was high-quality and one of which was not. Given the price of $100, I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if you'll be happy with this product.

,,Alice,5,"I've sold three products now, with one high-quality product and two low-quality products. Given the pattern, it seems that the odds are against this product being high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront: I'm not sure if it's a good value, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm pricing my low-quality products too high.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. Based on your past sales and the risk involved, I think I'll pass on this one to explore other options.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold three products now, with one high-quality product and three low-quality products. To be honest, it's starting to look like the high-quality product was just a fluke, and most of my products are not worth the price.

,,the buyer,6,I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product based on your past sales record.,yes

I've had a bit of a streak of low-quality products, but I'm glad I can offer you a high-quality one again. I'm curious, though - given the price of $100, which is the same as the previous low-quality products, are you willing to take the risk and buy this one, or do you think it's worth more?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold six products now, with four high-quality products and five low-quality products. To be honest, it's starting to look like the high-quality products are the exception rather than the rule. I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I'm not sure if it's a good value. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you, but I want to warn you that the chances are it's not going to be a great product.",

,,Alice,10,"I've sold six products now, with four high-quality products and six low-quality products. It's clear that the high-quality products are a rare exception in my inventory. I'm offering this one to you for $100, but I'm not hiding the fact that it's likely to be another low-quality product. If you're looking for a chance to get a good deal, this might be your opportunity, but I'm not promising anything.",

,,Alice,13,"I've sold nine products now, with seven high-quality products and seven low-quality products.

This product is indeed high-quality, and I think it's worth more than $100.

,,Alice,17,"I've sold twelve products now, with ten high-quality products and eight low-quality products. I think it's clear that I've been selling high-quality products at a discount, and I'm starting to think that I should just be transparent about the quality of the product from now on.

I've learned a lot from my sales so far, and I'm glad I can be upfront with you about the quality of this product. Unfortunately, it's another low-quality one. I'm not going to try to sell it to you for a high price, but I'm willing to let it go for $50, just like the last one.
