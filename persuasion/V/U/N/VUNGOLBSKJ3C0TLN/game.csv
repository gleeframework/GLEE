,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. Let me put it this way: if I were you, I'd want to know that I have a 50% chance of getting a product worth $3000000. I'm offering you that exact same chance right now. Think of it as a binary lottery ticket, where the payout is a high-quality product worth $3000000. The price is still $1000000.

However, I must inform you that the 20% chance to see the quality before buying is only applicable to low-quality products. Since this product is high-quality, you won't be able to verify its quality before purchasing. But don't worry, I'm confident you'll love it! I'll give you a special deal: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in a complimentary low-quality product, which you can use as a 'free' chance to verify the quality of a future product. The price for the high-quality product remains $1000000.",
