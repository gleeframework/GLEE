Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000. Given the probability of 80% that this product is high-quality, and considering that the last product I sold was high-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of this product being high-quality is also around 80%. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to reveal the quality of this product, and you're taking a risk by buying from me. If you're willing to take that risk, I'll sell it to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: I see you're thinking carefully about the probabilities. Let me give you some numbers. Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the previous 6 products are independent and identically distributed, the probability of selling 2 high-quality products in the next 2 rounds is around 51.2% (using the binomial distribution). The probability of selling 0 high-quality products in the next 2 rounds is around 12.8%. Considering these numbers, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $800000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. If I sell 2 more high-quality products in the next 2 rounds, I'll sell the next product to you for $600000. If I don't meet this condition, the price remains at $800000.
