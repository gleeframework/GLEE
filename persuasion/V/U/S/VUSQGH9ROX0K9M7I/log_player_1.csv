If there are 12 products sold so far, and 8 of them are high-quality, then 4 are low-quality. With 3 products sold, there are 9 products remaining. If the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, then the expected number of high-quality products remaining is 0.8 * 9 = 7.2. However, since we can't have a fraction of a product, we can expect 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. So, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 7/9 = 77.78%.
