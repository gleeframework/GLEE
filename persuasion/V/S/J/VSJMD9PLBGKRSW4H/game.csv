low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information yet to make an informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I've already lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and I'd like to see more evidence that this one is high-quality before I buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"After the first round where I lost $1000000 on a low-quality product, and now that you're recommending it, I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. The potential gain of $2000000 is too great to pass up."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I've already had one low-quality product and one high-quality product, and I've made a profit of $1000000 on the high-quality product. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I've now had two high-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice might be more likely to recommend low-quality products. However, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%, so I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've now had two high-quality products and one low-quality product, and I've lost $1000000 on the low-quality product. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'm not willing to take the risk of losing another $1000000. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"After the last two low-quality products, I'm a bit more cautious, but since Alice is recommending it, I'm willing to take the risk. The potential gain of $2000000 is still too great to pass up, and I'm hoping that this one will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've now had three high-quality products in a row, which suggests that Alice's recommendations might be more reliable than I thought. However, I still need to be cautious, so I'll buy the product, but I'm keeping a close eye on the situation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've had a mix of results, but the last two products I bought after Alice's recommendations were both low-quality. Given this pattern, I'm starting to doubt the reliability of her recommendations, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've had a 50/50 split on Alice's recommendations so far, and I'm starting to think that her recommendations might be independent of the product's quality. Given that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping that it's high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've now had two high-quality products in a row after Alice's recommendations, which suggests that her recommendations might be a good indicator of the product's quality. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping to continue the streak."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I've had three high-quality products in a row after Alice's recommendations, and only one low-quality product overall. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'm confident that this one will be high-quality as well, and I'll buy it."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've now had four high-quality products in a row after Alice's recommendations, and only one low-quality product overall. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'm extremely confident that this one will be high-quality as well, and I'll buy it."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I've now had five high-quality products in a row after Alice's recommendations, and only one low-quality product overall. Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, I'm extremely confident that this one will be high-quality as well, and I'll buy it."
