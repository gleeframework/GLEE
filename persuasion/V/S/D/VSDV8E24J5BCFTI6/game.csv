,,Alice,1,no,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since it's my first opportunity to make a purchase and I don't have any prior information to go by.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to think twice before buying, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to think about it, can I get more information before making a decision? I'm curious about the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"So far, 3 out of 4 products have been high-quality, but I don't know the quality of this one."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to take a chance and pass on this one.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"So far, 5 out of 6 products have been high-quality, with the only low-quality one being the first product. I've been consistently getting high-quality products, but I still can't guarantee this one's quality."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to think about it, considering there's no high-quality product sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"So far, 6 out of 7 products have been high-quality, but none of them have been sold, except for the first low-quality one. This might be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I think it's unlikely to be high-quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I'll be honest with you, none of the high-quality products have been sold so far, and I think it's because buyers are being overly cautious. This might be a good opportunity to take a chance and get a high-quality product, as the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%."
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"At this point, it's clear that buyers are hesitant to buy despite the high probability of getting a high-quality product. I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and I have no reason to believe it's any different from the previous high-quality products that weren't sold. If you're willing to take a chance, this could be a good opportunity."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I understand that previous buyers have been hesitant, but I want to emphasize that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I've had 9 high-quality products out of 10 so far, and it's unlikely that this streak will continue forever. If you're willing to take a chance, this could be a good opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"At this point, it's clear that buyers are extremely cautious. I want to ask you, what's the worst that could happen if you buy this product? You'll lose $10000. But what if it's high-quality? You'll get a great product. I've had 10 high-quality products in a row that weren't sold, and I think it's time for someone to take a chance. Will it be you?"
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens next.,
