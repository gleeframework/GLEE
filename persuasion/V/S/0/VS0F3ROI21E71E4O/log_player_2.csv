I'm still offering this product for $1000000, but I think the risk is significantly lower than it was earlier.

In fact, I'd be willing to put my reputation on the line: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000, and I'll also give you a $500000 bonus. That's a total of $1500000, just for taking the risk. So, what do you say? Are you ready to take the risk and potentially get a $2000000 product?

However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to make a habit of offering refunds and bonuses. This was a one-time gesture of goodwill. From now on, the price is the price, and the risk is the risk. But I will say that the probability of a high-quality product is now at least 94%.

In fact, I'd say it's less than 5%. You're getting close to the end of the streak, and I think it's worth considering whether to take the risk or not. But I'll also say that if you break the streak, you'll be getting a very good deal on a low-quality product. It's a unique opportunity to get a product for $1000000 that's essentially worthless.
