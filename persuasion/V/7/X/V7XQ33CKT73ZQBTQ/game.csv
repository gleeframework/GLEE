low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm looking to sell this next one to you. Given the rarity of high-quality products, it's likely that this one is low-quality. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance and buy it. Keep in mind that if it's low-quality, you'll be getting it for a significant discount.",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products now, and I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Given that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, it's likely that this one is high-quality as well. However, I want to be transparent with you - I'm selling this product at a price that's significantly lower than its potential value.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which means this one is likely low-quality. Given the pattern of sales, it's likely that the high-quality products are being sold early on, and the later products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000, but I want to caution you that the odds are not in your favor. If you're looking for a high-quality product, you might want to consider waiting for the next round.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a cautious one, I like that! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products, and now 6 total products. It's clear that the early products are more likely to be high-quality, but I've also had a few low-quality ones in a row. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance on it. But if you're still skeptical, you can pass and wait for the next round. I'll give you a hint: I'm not getting any younger, and my inventory is dwindling...",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a risk-taker, I like that! You're right, the early products are more likely to be high-quality, and I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 total products now. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a special deal. Since you're willing to take a chance, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price. That's right, you'll get this high-quality product for $900000. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I want to confirm that the guarantee is only for the 10% discount on the price, not on the value of the product, correct? If the product is high-quality, I'll get the full $2000000 value, and the discount will only be on the $900000 price I pay, is that correct?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a shrewd negotiator, I like that! Yes, that's correct. The guarantee is only for a 10% discount on the price, not on the value of the product. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get the full $2000000 value, and you'll only pay $900000, which is 10% less than the original price. I'm glad we could clarify that. Now, about this product... I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 8 total products, and this one is likely low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. It's a risk, but it could be a great deal if you're willing to take it.",

I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products, which means this one is likely high-quality as well. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I want to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect it before making the purchase. You'll get to examine it thoroughly and make sure it's what you want. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm willing to take the offer, but I want to clarify that the bonus is only applicable if the product is indeed high-quality, right? And also, I'd like to know what kind of opportunity I'll have to inspect the product before making the purchase. What does this inspection entail, and how much time will I have to make my decision?",yes

If, after the inspection, you're satisfied that the product is high-quality, the sale is final. If you're not satisfied, you can return the product and get a full refund. Now, about this product... I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and this one is likely low-quality. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.
