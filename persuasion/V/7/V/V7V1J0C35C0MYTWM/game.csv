,,Alice,4,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'm not convinced it's high quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's unlikely this product is high-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the fact that you've recommended against the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to assume that the product is likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of a high-quality product may be lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, based on the data so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products and total products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since you don't know how much it's worth to me, and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, 5 out of 5 products sold were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality as well. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's reasonable to assume that the current product is also low-quality. I'll pass on the product to avoid the loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality, but I've seen that all previous buyers have passed on Alice's recommendation, which suggests that they might have had a good reason to do so. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased the products with no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not in my favor. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk to get it for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance based on the statistics. If 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'd be crazy not to buy this one, given the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality."
