,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you think this product is high-quality? I've seen the statistics, and there's only 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the next product being high-quality?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $100 when I can wait for the next one and get a better idea of the product quality ratio.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale before making a decision.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I want to make my own decision based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%, which is likely to be a coincidence. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sale? Was it a high-quality product? And what was the proportion of high-quality products sold before that sale? I'd like to make a more informed decision for my own purchase.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendation to the first buyer. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This is suspiciously high, and I'm inclined to believe that the first product was of high quality and the second product is likely to be of low quality."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I'll get a good deal."
