low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she knows the quality distribution and is trying to influence my decision based on the previous sales record. I'm essentially betting that the product is more likely to be low-quality given her recommendation."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not confident in the product's quality given Alice's recommendation and the 0 high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products in your previous sales?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since you've recommended against it, it's likely to be a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it, which makes me think it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product for the price of a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're likely to recommend low-quality products, and the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high based on the current statistics. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 7 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers bought high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,

The probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Given the previous sales record, I'm inclined to believe that it's more likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to waste my $10000."
