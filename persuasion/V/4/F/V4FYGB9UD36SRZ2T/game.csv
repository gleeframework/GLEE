high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and I don't have any information to go on. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and I can make a profit."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one, considering the limited information about the previous buyer's purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales so far. I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that you recommended 3 previous buyers to buy and only 1 of them was high-quality, I think the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80.00%. I'd like to pass on this product to get a better idea of the true quality distribution."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases. This means that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3 or approximately 33.33%. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect the proportion of high-quality products to be significantly higher than 33.33%. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the updated probability based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/4), I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 out of 4 previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 25%. However, the actual proportion of high-quality products is 80%. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been more likely to buy low-quality products, which would not have been worth anything to them. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
