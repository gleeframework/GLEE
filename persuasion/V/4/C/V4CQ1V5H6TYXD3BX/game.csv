,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics before I make my final decision."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering your recommendation and the statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I would like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality but rather on the fact that the first buyer bought it. I'd like to observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to observe more data before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase, especially since the only sale so far was a high-quality product, which might be a fluke."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, but I'd like to take the chance to buy a potentially high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record, and I'd appreciate it if you could share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see if you can provide more information about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what is the probability that I would buy a high-quality product based on the current statistics?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, I think the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 80% because 3 high-quality products out of 4 sales is not a perfect representation of the true probability. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, and 3 of them were high quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than the overall probability (80%). This might indicate that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is of higher value."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and Alice's recommendation is not convincing me to take the risk."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, as I think the expected value of buying a high-quality product is worth it."
