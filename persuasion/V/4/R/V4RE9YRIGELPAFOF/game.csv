,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 9 products were high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, but with 2 high-quality products out of 9, the probability of the current product being high-quality is (2/9)/(9/10) = 20%. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her expertise and pass on the product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
