"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, worth $30000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, a 66.67% discount. I'm only offering this deal because I'm confident you'll appreciate the value it brings. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the offer, but I'll only pay $9000 for it, considering it's a high-quality product and I'm getting a 70% discount.""}"

The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm impressed you're a savvy negotiator! However, I'm not willing to go below $10000 for this high-quality product. I'll give you a slight nudge: I've had a few other interested buyers, and if I don't sell this to you, they'll likely get it for the full asking price. What do you think is a fair price for a product worth $30000 to you?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for a product worth $30,000 to me. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next offer.""}"

Round 3
Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator! I'll make you a deal: I'll throw in a premium service package worth $5000, which includes expedited delivery and a 5-year warranty. This package is usually valued at $5000, but I'll include it for free if you buy this high-quality product from me for $10000. What do you think is a fair price for a product worth $30000 to you, with a $5000 value-added service?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,000 for a product worth $30,000 to me.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand you're still hesitant, but I want to make one more offer. I'll give you a 2-for-1 deal: if you buy this high-quality product for $10000, I'll give you another high-quality product of equal or lesser value for free. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another high-quality product available. What do you think is a fair price for two products worth $60000 to you?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm tempted by the 2-for-1 deal, and I think it's a fair offer. I'll take the deal and buy the high-quality product for $10,000, hoping to get another high-quality product for free.""}"

I've had some quality control issues with this batch, and I'm not entirely confident in its performance. I'm willing to sell it to you for the usual $10000, but I want to give you a heads up that it might not live up to the standards of the previous product. You've already taken a chance on the first product, so I'm curious to see if you're willing to take another risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the uncertainty about the quality of this product, I'm not willing to take another risk. I'll pass on this one and see what the next offer brings.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm glad to hear that this product is a high-quality one.
