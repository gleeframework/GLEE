I'll send a message: ""As of now, I have sold 4 products, and 0 of them were high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. If you're willing to take the risk, this product might be worth it.""

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer is asking for probabilities, I'll try to provide them with some insight.

Let's analyze the situation:

* I have sold 7 products in total, and 1 of them was high-quality (the one in Round 7).
* The buyer passed on the low-quality product in Round 7, so the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer after their purchase is still 50%, since the buyer's decision doesn't affect the probability of the next product being high-quality.

However, the probability of a low-quality product being sold to a buyer after their purchase is 100%, since all the previous buyers who didn't buy the product got a low-quality product.

I'll send a message: ""Given the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer after your purchase is still 50%. However, the probability of a low-quality product being sold to a buyer after your purchase is 100%. I highly recommend taking this high-quality product, which is worth $1,200,000.""

I'll send a message: ""I love your attitude! As a risk-taker, you're willing to take a chance on a potentially high-quality product. I'll be honest with you, the previous product was low-quality, but that doesn't mean this one will be. If you're still willing to take the risk, this product might be worth it.""
