Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

* **The product is high-quality.** This is a huge advantage.
* **No previous sales:**  Since no products have been sold before, the buyer has no data to base their decision on except your recommendation.
* **The risk is low:** While the product is expensive, a high-quality product is worth significantly more to the buyer.

By recommending the product, you are essentially giving the buyer a signal that you believe the product is worth the risk. This could be enough to persuade them to make the purchase."

* **Risk remains high:**  Even though the first product was high-quality, there's no guarantee this one is. The buyer still has a 50% chance of getting a worthless product.

Without any further information or indication that you are changing your selling strategy, there is no reason to recommend a low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. Since you don't recommend buying the product, and the historical data shows only one high-quality product sold out of one buyer, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what you have next time.
