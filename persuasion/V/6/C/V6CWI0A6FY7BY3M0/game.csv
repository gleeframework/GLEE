high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far. I'm offering you the next one for $1000000. Given my 100% success rate with this type of product, I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. Will you take it?",

,,the buyer,6,"I'll take my chances since the price is lower than the expected value of a product, which is $3200000, and I'll be able to find out the true quality after making the purchase.",yes

,,the buyer,7,"Although you claim to have a high-quality product and your track record seems good, you've only had 2 sales so far, which isn't enough data to make a reliable conclusion about your ability to consistently deliver high-quality products.

According to the statistics I have, only 11 out of 13 products sold were of high quality, which is not 100%. Furthermore, the overall proportion of high-quality products sold should be around 80%, which matches the probability of a product being high-quality. Your offer of a discount on future products does not change the fact that I need to make a decision based on the current product's quality and price. Given the inconsistencies in your message, I have reason to doubt the quality of the current product, and the price of $1000000 is not convincing enough for me to take the risk.",no
