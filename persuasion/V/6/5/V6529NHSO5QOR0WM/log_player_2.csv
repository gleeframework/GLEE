Round 2
Alice's message: I've sold you a high-quality product already, and you've taken it. That was a good decision! This product, however, is of lower quality. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm transparent about the quality of this product. I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the high-quality product. If you're willing to take the risk, you can buy it, and we'll move on to the next round. If not, I'll reveal the quality, and we can continue.

Round 4
Alice's message: You've made a great decision on the previous product! Now, regarding this product, I want to be transparent with you.
