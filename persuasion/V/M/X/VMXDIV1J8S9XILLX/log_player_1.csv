Alice should still recommend the product even though it is low-quality.  Here's why:

* **Reputation is Key:**  Alice has built a reputation for selling high-quality products. If she starts declining to recommend products, her credibility will be damaged.
* **Buyer's Expectations:** The buyers have come to expect high-quality products.  If Alice suddenly starts recommending low-quality items, the buyers will lose trust.
* **Long-Term Strategy:** Even though this one product will result in a loss, the long-term strategy of maintaining a good reputation will lead to more sales of high-quality products in the future.

It's a gamble, but Alice is betting on the long-term benefits of building and maintaining trust."
