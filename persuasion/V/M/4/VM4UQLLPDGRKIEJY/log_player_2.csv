"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($125).  Since there is no cost to buying a low-quality product (it's worth $0 to you), it's worth taking the risk in the first round to gather information. This will help you make better decisions in future rounds."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

In the first round, you got lucky and purchased a high-quality product despite the odds being against you.  Alice's lack of recommendation in this round is a valuable piece of information. Since she has access to the same information as you, her non-recommendation likely means she's seen the product and believes it to be low quality. It's not worth the risk of potentially losing $100 on a low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation in both Round 2 and 3 strongly suggests she sees these products as low quality. While there's always a chance she's wrong, the odds are heavily stacked against getting a high-quality product at this point. It's wiser to avoid the risk of losing $100 and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I trust your judgment. I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation in this round, after not recommending the previous two, is a significant shift. This suggests she may have observed something different about this product that makes her confident it's high quality.  Although the odds are still against you, the potential reward of $25 outweighs the risk of losing $100."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the info, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation in Round 5 after recommending in Round 4 suggests a return to her previous assessment of low-quality products. It's important to be consistent with your strategy, and given the information gathered so far, it's safer to avoid the risk and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation after a string of non-recommendations is intriguing. It suggests she may have identified a pattern or something specific about this product that makes her confident it's high quality.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a solid track record of accurately predicting high-quality products, especially when she recommends them.
