,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous 3 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I think it's likely that this product is low quality.

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have been discouraged by Alice's recommendation, I suspect that all the products sold so far were low-quality.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would like to pass on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is 0%. This is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to observe more data before making a decision."
