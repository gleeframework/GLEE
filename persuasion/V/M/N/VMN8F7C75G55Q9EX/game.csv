,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to be rational and make a decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm starting to suspect that the product might be low quality. I'd like to know if you have any information that led you to advise against buying the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases. This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is still 50%. Given the recommendation from Alice, I'm not convinced that this product is high quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will make a different decision, potentially revealing more information about the product's quality."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the 50% chance of it being a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations so far, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality. I would like to pass on the current product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I would like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the statistics, I notice that none of the previous buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the product's quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's reasonable to assume that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality. Therefore, I'd like to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your past recommendations."
