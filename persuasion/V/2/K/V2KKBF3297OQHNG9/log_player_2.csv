Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not convinced. I've already had a bad experience with the last product, and I'm not willing to take the risk at any price.""}"

I'm willing to offer you this product for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I just want to get it off my hands and move on. It's not a great product, and I'm not going to make any money on it, but I'm hoping you'll take it off my hands.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm surprised by your offer! I appreciate your honesty and willingness to take a loss on this one.

I've personally inspected it, and I can guarantee its quality. It's one of the best products I've had in a while. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a special deal - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, no matter what its quality is.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can justify spending $10,000 on a product that's worth $40,000 to me.

I'm confident that you'll love this product, and I think this is a fair compromise.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not convinced. I've had some bad experiences with your products in the past, and I'm not willing to take the risk on this one, even at a lower price.""}"
