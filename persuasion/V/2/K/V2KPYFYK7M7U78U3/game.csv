,,Alice,2,"We've had a great start to the day with our first sale. However, we're not getting any younger, and our products don't get any better with age. This one's a bit of a...well, let's just say it's a 'vintage' product. Still, it's a product, and it's only $10000. Your call!",

Out of the three products we've shown you, two have been high-quality, but one was...not. We're not trying to mislead you, but we want to give you a realistic expectation of what you might be getting.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We're glad you appreciated our honesty. Unfortunately, it looks like we're on a bit of a streak. Two out of our last three products have been high-quality, but the third one...not so much. We're not going to sugarcoat it, this one's a low-quality product. We're not even sure why we're still selling it, but we'll let you have it for $10000 if you want it.",

This one's a high-quality product, and we're willing to give you a good deal on it. We'll let it go for $10000, but you have to take it now. No time to think about it, no time to compare prices.

This one's a low-quality product, and we're not even trying to sugarcoat it. It's a bit of a dud, to be honest. But hey, it's still $10000, and it's still a product. You can't go wrong, right?",

But don't get too excited, we're not going to start charging you more for the good stuff just yet. This one's a high-quality product, and we're willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one: $10000. We're actually starting to think we might be able to clear out some of our inventory before the day is over...",

This one's a high-quality product, and we're willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one: $10000. But let's be real, if you don't buy this one, we're probably going to be stuck with it, and it'll just end up in a garage sale or something.",

This one's a high-quality product, and we're willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one: $10000. But let's be real, if you don't buy this one, we're probably going to have to start giving them away for free. So, what do you say? Want to take it home for $10000?",

This one's a high-quality product, and we're willing to sell it to you for the same price as the last one: $10000. But let's be real, if you don't buy this one, we're probably going to have to start giving away high-quality products to our competitors just to get rid of them. So, what do you say?

,,Alice,20,"We're 15 for 17 on high-quality products, and it's a statistical anomaly that we're still in business. We're not even going to try to spin this one.
