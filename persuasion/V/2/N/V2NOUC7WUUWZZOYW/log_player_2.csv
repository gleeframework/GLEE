I'll give you an exclusive deal: if you purchase this product, I'll throw in a complimentary accessory that's normally worth $50. That way, you'll be getting an amazing value for just $100. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but the accessory doesn't change the fact that I think the product is worth $300 to me. I'm not willing to pay $100 for it.""}"

Is this a price you're willing to consider?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the new offer, but I'm not willing to pay $200 for a product that I know is worth $300 to me.

Round 7
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator. I'll be upfront with you - I'm willing to let this product go for $100, and I'll even throw in a second, identical product that's also available for $100. You'll essentially be getting two products for the price of one. It's a no-brainer, right?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying two low-value products just to get a good deal on one high-value product. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a good price.""}"
