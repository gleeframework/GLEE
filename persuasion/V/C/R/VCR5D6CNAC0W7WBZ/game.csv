,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me. I'd like to see the next product.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal. I'll let you have this product for $800000, which is still a significant discount from its true value. I'll also throw in a 10-year warranty and a 30-day money-back guarantee. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a price that's almost as good as buying it at its true value.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that the warranty and guarantee make up for the fact that the product may still be worth $0 to me. I'd like to see the next product.,no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. Let me be transparent with you - I'm willing to take on some risk to sell this product to you. I'll let you have it for $900000, but I'll also give you the option to return it for a full refund if it's not worth $1000000 to you. This way, you can try the product risk-free and see if it's valuable to you. If it is, you can keep it and enjoy the benefits. If not, you can return it and get your money back.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll let you have this product for $950000, but I'll also give you a 'get out of jail free' card - if you buy this product and it's not worth $1000000 to you, I'll give you another product of your choice from my inventory, absolutely free. This way, you can take a calculated risk, and if it doesn't pay off, you can still get something of value from me.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing this because of the 'get out of jail free' card. I'm not convinced that the product is worth $950000 to me, but I'm willing to try my luck.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the risk and liked the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. I've had some issues with the manufacturing process, and I'm not as confident in the quality of this one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000, which is a fraction of its usual price. I think it's still a good value, but I'm being transparent with you about the potential risks. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance on it. If not, I completely understand.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to take a chance on a product that Alice is not confident in. I've already had two high-quality products offered to me, and I'm not going to risk losing money on a potentially low-quality product. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your caution, and I respect your decision. This next product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $980000. I'm willing to make a deal with you - if you buy this product and it's the last one I have left, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get a great deal on this product, and you'll also get a head start on future purchases.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the deal, but I want to clarify that I'll only get the 10% discount if I buy a future product from you, not if I pass on the next product. I'm buying this one for $980000, and I'm looking forward to the potential discount on the next one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the previous product. As for this next product, I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality item, and I'm not confident in its value. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $50000, just like last time. I'm not trying to trick you or take advantage of you, but I do want to make a sale. If you're feeling charitable, you could consider buying it and giving it to someone who might appreciate it. If not, I completely understand.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to take a chance on a low-quality product, especially not at a price that's higher than last time. I've already had two high-quality products offered to me, and I'm not going to waste my money on something that's not worth it. I'd like to see the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one more offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $0. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I'm not making any money on this one, and I'm essentially eating the cost. If you're willing to take it off my hands, I'd appreciate it.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to turn down a free product, but I want to make it clear that I'm only taking it because it's free, not because I think it's worth anything to me. I'm not expecting any value from this product, and I'm doing this as a favor to you, Alice.",yes

,,Alice,9,"I completely understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to take the low-quality product off my hands. As for this next product, I want to make a strong case for why it's worth considering. This is a high-quality item that's worth $2000000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I know I've had some issues with low-quality products in the past, but I'm confident that this one is a winner. I'm also willing to throw in a premium service package, which includes dedicated support and priority updates, to give you even more value from this product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. You've already sold me two high-quality products at the full price of $1000000, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for another one. I'd like to see the next product.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,

I'm not going to offer this deal again, so if you're interested, now is the time to act.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not convinced that the bundle is worth an additional $200000. I'd have to pay $1150000 for the product, and I'm not sure it's worth that to me. I'd like to see the next product.",no

I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is and stand behind the quality of this product.",
