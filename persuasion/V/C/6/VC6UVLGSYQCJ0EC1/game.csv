,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation, especially since the first buyer didn't buy after her recommendation."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's no data yet, so I'm not influenced by the previous buyer's decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 2 previous buyers also passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product is likely low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, it's not worth the risk for me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the products offered are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products were sold, I'm inclined to think the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. Can you provide an updated probability based on the data?"

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data or a different recommendation before making a decision."
