high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a relatively low proportion of high-quality products.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 4th buyer and I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold will be higher than 1/3, which would be a positive indication of the quality of the products."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers may have been more likely to buy high-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd also like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the current statistics.

,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and get a good deal."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record. If 6 out of 6 buyers purchased the products recommended by you, it's likely that you're recommending low-quality products. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 7th buyer and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/6 = 0.5, which is consistent with the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. However, I'm not convinced that this is a high-quality product and I'd rather not take the risk."
