,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, and if it's high quality, I'll be happy to pay the $3000000 it's worth to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of a recommendation might indicate that the product is low-quality, and I can get a good deal on it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, considering that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the seller's previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts. The probability of this product being high quality is still 33.33%, but the fact that the previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't find a high-quality product makes me cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the third buyer and I know the statistics. I'll buy it and hope it's high-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy, and none of them purchased a high-quality product.

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product.
