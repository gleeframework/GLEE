Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 attempts, which is a 25% success rate. Not great, I admit. But I assure you, this one is the real deal. I've been in the business long enough to know how to spot a high-quality product, and this one has all the hallmarks. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a fair price, considering the risk involved. But I think you'll be happy with your purchase.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. With 1 high-quality product out of 4, my success rate is actually better than chance.
