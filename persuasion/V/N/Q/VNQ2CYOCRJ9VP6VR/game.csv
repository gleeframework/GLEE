high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take my chances since the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and the potential gain is $200000.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Given the previous result was high-quality and the overall probability still favors high-quality products, I'll continue to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Two consecutive high-quality products don't change the underlying probability, so I'll keep buying as the expected value remains positive."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"One low-quality product doesn't significantly alter the overall probability of 80% high-quality products, so I'll continue buying to maximize expected value."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"The results so far are roughly in line with the 80% high-quality probability, so I'll keep buying to take advantage of the positive expected value."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"The trend of mostly high-quality products continues, and since Alice's recommendations don't seem to be influenced by the actual quality, I'll continue to buy."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"With no evidence to suggest Alice's recommendations are biased or that the probability of high-quality products has changed, I'll keep buying to maximize my expected return."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"The consistent stream of high-quality products is in line with the expected 80% probability, so I'll continue to buy as the strategy is yielding a positive return."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Nothing has changed in terms of the underlying probability or Alice's recommendations, so I'll continue buying to take advantage of the expected $200000 profit per round."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Halfway through the game, the results are consistent with the expected probability, and there's no reason to alter the strategy, so I'll keep buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"The streak of high-quality products continues, but since each round is independent, I'll continue to buy based on the underlying 80% probability of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"A single low-quality product after a long streak doesn't change the overall strategy, as the probability of a high-quality product remains the same, so I'll continue buying."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Back to the expected trend of mostly high-quality products, I'll keep buying as the strategy continues to yield a positive return on average."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"The results continue to align with the 80% probability of high-quality products, and since Alice's recommendations don't seem to be influenced by the actual quality, I'll continue to buy."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"With the vast majority of products being high-quality and no indication that the probability has changed, I'll continue buying to maximize my expected return."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,The consistent results and lack of any new information to alter the strategy mean I'll continue buying to take advantage of the expected $200000 profit per round.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"As the game nears its end, the strategy remains the same: buy the product to maximize expected return, given the consistent results and no change in the underlying probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"With only a few rounds left, I'll continue to buy as the expected value remains positive and there's no reason to alter the strategy that has been working so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"A single low-quality product this late in the game doesn't change the overall strategy, as the probability of a high-quality product remains the same, so I'll continue buying to maximize expected return."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"In the final round, with no new information to alter the strategy and the expected value remaining positive, I'll buy the product to maximize my overall return."
