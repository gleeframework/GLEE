,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. I don't know its value to you, but I'll give you a 100% refund if you decide not to buy it. If you buy it, you'll find out its quality after the fact. If it's high-quality, I'll consider it a good purchase. If it's low-quality, I'll consider it a bad purchase. Please let me know your decision.",

If you buy this next product, I'll give you an additional 10% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. This way, you'll get 110% of your money back if it's a bad purchase. What do you say?",
