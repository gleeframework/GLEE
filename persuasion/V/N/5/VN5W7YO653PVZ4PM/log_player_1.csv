"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob doesn't know the quality of the product, the expected value of buying is positive. Here's why:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Value of high-quality product to Bob:** $300
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Value of low-quality product to Bob:** $0

**Expected Value Calculation:**

(0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * $0) = $240

The expected value of buying the product ($240) is greater than the price ($100). Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is a good decision, as in the long run, Bob is likely to make a profit."
