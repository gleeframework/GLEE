* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice recommends buying, it implies she believes the current product is likely high quality. 
* **Value proposition:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($120). The risk of losing $100 is outweighed by the potential reward.

**Overall:** The odds are in the buyer's favor, and the potential upside is large enough to justify the risk."
