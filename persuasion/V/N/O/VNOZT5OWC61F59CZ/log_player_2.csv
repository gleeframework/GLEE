**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has a very good track record of selling high-quality products (3 out of 4). 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, indicating she believes the product is high quality.
* **Value proposition:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $200 high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is acting in good faith and wants to maintain her reputation. However, there's always a risk involved, and the decision ultimately depends on your level of risk tolerance."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is encouraging:**  13 out of 16 products sold were high quality, which is significantly higher than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. This suggests Alice is likely recommending products she knows are high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the data. While it's not guaranteed, it suggests that Alice believes the current product is likely high quality.
* **Potential gain:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $200 high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 low-quality product, especially with the strong data and Alice's recommendation."
