,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I have no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'm essentially flipping a coin. I'm hoping for a high-quality product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy the products, which might indicate that the products were low-quality. I don't want to be the third buyer in a row to potentially end up with a low-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that the products are all low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations, and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the remaining products are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward is worth it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than 50%. I'd like to know the quality of the product after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 0 out of 4 products to previous buyers, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,

,,Alice,18,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation, so I'm hoping to get a high-quality product for $1000000."
