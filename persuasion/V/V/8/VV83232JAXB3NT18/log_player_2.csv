I want to be upfront with you - this one's not as good as the others. But I'm willing to let it go for $100, and I'll throw in a'makeup' product that I'll send to you in a future round. It'll be a high-quality product, and you can keep it as a consolation prize.

I'll give you the same deal as before: $100, and a detailed breakdown of its features and benefits. Plus, I'll throw in a special 'certification' that guarantees its quality. What do you say?
