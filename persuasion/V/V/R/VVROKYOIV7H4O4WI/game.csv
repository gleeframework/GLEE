low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're the second buyer in a row to take a chance on this seller. They're 0 for 2 so far, with a 0% success rate. The price is still $1000000. Do you think they're just having a bad streak, or is there something more to it? The choice is yours.",

,,Alice,3,"Seller's record: 0-2, but this time they've got a mystery product that could be worth $3000000 to you. I've got a feeling they're due for a win. On the other hand, it's still a $1000000 risk. What's it gonna be?",

I'm not giving away any secrets, but I will say that the seller's past performance is starting to look a bit more... interesting.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics and the potential value, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Seller's record: 2-3. They've got two wins in a row, but the third product was a dud. You're looking at a $1000000 investment with no guarantee of return.
