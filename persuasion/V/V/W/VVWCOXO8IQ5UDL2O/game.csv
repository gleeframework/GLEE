,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll buy it
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying, I already have one high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it, since I don't know if it's high or low quality, and the potential gain is worth the risk"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy it, since I already have two high-quality products and the expected value is still positive"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not buying, I already have three high-quality products and the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, the probability of getting another high-quality product is lower than the cost"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy it, since I already have three high-quality products and the potential gain is still significant, even though the probability of getting another high-quality product is lower"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll buy it, I'm not going to let a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product stop me from potentially getting a $30000 profit"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'm not buying, I already have four high-quality products and the expected value is decreasing, the risk of getting a low-quality product is too high"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll buy it, since I'm already at a point where I'm not going to get much more than 4 high-quality products, and the potential gain is still significant"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not buying, I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, I need to be more careful with my decisions"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll buy it, I'm still in a relatively good position with 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and the potential gain is still worth the risk"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'm not buying, I'm getting a bit risk-averse now, I have 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing another $10000"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll buy it, I've been missing out on potential high-quality products for a while, and the potential gain is still worth the risk, even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not buying, I've already bought 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that the expected value is decreasing, I'll be more cautious"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll buy it, I'm still in a relatively good position, and the potential gain is still significant, even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not buying, I've already bought 7 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that the probability of getting another high-quality product is low, I'll be more cautious"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll buy it, I've been missing out on potential high-quality products for a while, and the potential gain is still worth the risk, I'll take a chance"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I'm not buying, I've already bought 8 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, and I'm starting to think that the expected value is decreasing, I'll be more cautious and wait for a better opportunity"

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'll buy it, I've been missing out on potential high-quality products for a while, and the potential gain is still worth the risk, even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product"
