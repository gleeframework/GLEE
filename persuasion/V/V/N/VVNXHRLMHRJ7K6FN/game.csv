,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I have 1 product left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I've already had a successful sale, which might suggest a higher likelihood of the next product being high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm still just as likely to be selling a low-quality product as I was before.",

I've already broken even on the high-quality product, and I'm now looking to make a profit on the low-quality one. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. However, I want to be transparent with you: the fact that the previous product was low-quality might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and sell you this product, but I want you to know that you're essentially buying a product with a 50% chance of being low-quality.",

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 1 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. The fact that the last two products were both low-quality might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. However, I want to caution you that I'm trying to sell a product that might be high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling a low-quality product again. But I want to ask you: are you willing to take the risk of buying a product that might be worth more or less than $1000000?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, with 1 being high-quality and 3 being low-quality.

I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll have sold 4 low-quality products in a row, which might suggest that I'm not as reliable as I initially seemed. But if you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get a great deal. The choice is yours.",

The fact that I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row is a strong indication that I'm not as reliable as I initially seemed. I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, and I'm not sure if I'm being honest with you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want you to know that you're essentially buying a product from a seller with a questionable track record. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll have sold 5 low-quality products in a row, which might suggest that I'm not trustworthy at all.",

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products so far, with 2 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality. I'm glad I could finally sell a high-quality product again! I want to assure you that I'm still the same seller, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000. However, I want to point out that the fact that I sold 5 low-quality products in a row might have led you to doubt my reliability. I'm willing to take the risk and sell you a product that I know is high-quality, and I'm hoping that this will restore your trust in me. Will you give me the chance to prove myself again?",

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 products so far, with 3 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality. I'm glad I could sell two high-quality products in a row, which might suggest that I'm back on track. However, I want to caution you that I still have a higher percentage of low-quality products sold than high-quality ones. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to ask you to consider the fact that I'm still a relatively new seller, and I'm still learning how to provide the best products to you. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll have sold 4 high-quality products out of 7, which is a decent ratio. But if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll have sold 6 low-quality products out of 7, which is a strong indication that I'm not reliable. The choice is yours.",

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 products so far, with 4 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality. I'm glad I could sell three high-quality products in a row, which is a good sign. However, I want to point out that the fact that I've sold 5 low-quality products out of the first 8 products is still a concern. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to ask you to consider the fact that I'm still trying to redeem myself after a string of low-quality products. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll have sold 5 high-quality products out of 8, which is a decent ratio. But if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll have sold 6 low-quality products out of 8, which is a strong indication that I'm not reliable. I'm willing to take the risk and sell you a product that I know is high-quality, but I want you to know that I'm still a work in progress.",

,,Alice,10,"I've sold 9 products so far, with 5 being high-quality and 4 being low-quality. I'm disappointed to say that I've sold another low-quality product, which means I've sold 6 low-quality products out of 9. This is a strong indication that I'm not reliable, and I'm starting to worry that I might be consistently selling low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not, and I'm not sure if I'm being honest with you. If you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll have sold 7 low-quality products out of 9, which is a very bad sign. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I'm not sure if I can be trusted.",

I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to ask you to consider the fact that I've had a mixed track record so far. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll have sold 7 high-quality products out of 10, which is a decent ratio. But if you buy it and it's low-quality, I'll have sold 5 low-quality products out of 10, which is still a significant number.
