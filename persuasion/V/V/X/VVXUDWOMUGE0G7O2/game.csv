low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
