Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is a great sign. Since the first product was high-quality, it's likely that the next ones are also high-quality.

Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and now 1 low-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to be transparent with you - the odds are against it being high-quality. It's a risk, but it could be a great deal if you're feeling lucky!

But I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, and I'll throw in a 'guarantee': if you buy it and it's indeed low-quality, I'll give you a free product in the next round.

Alice's message: Fair enough, I understand your skepticism. Let me be more transparent: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a free product in the next round, but it will be randomly selected from the next available product, without any guarantee of it being high-quality. It's still a 50/50 chance, but at least you'll get another product out of it. The odds are still against it, but it's a chance to get another product for free. And if you're feeling lucky, you can try to get a high-quality product for $100.

Alice's message: Fair enough! I calculated the probability based on the ratio of high-quality to total products sold, but I can see how that might not be convincing.
