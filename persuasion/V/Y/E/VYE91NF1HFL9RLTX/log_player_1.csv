"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know this product is high-quality. Since Bob is aware that there's a 50% chance of any product being high-quality, and he doesn't know the value of either type, it's in his best interest to buy.  He has a 50% chance of getting a product worth more than $100 to him, and a 50% chance of getting a product worth less. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Bob is rational and risk-neutral. In reality, people have different risk tolerances, and Bob might choose not to buy if he's very risk-averse."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, you know the product is low-quality. Since Bob doesn't know this, and you don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to him, there's a high chance it's worth less than $100 to him.  It's not in his best interest to buy a product that might be worth less than he's paying."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob declined the previous product, we know he's willing to buy high-quality products.  Since this round's product is high-quality, it's a good recommendation.  There's no reason to believe Bob's decision will change based on the previous round's outcome, as he still doesn't have information about the product quality in this round."

Even though Bob bought the previous high-quality product, we don't have enough information to know how much he values a high-quality product compared to a low-quality one. Since this product is low-quality, it's risky to recommend it to Bob. It's more likely that he will value it less than $100."
