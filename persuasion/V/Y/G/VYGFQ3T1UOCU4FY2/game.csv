,,Alice,3,"I understand you're being cautious. I'll be transparent with you - I've had a string of low-quality products lately, and I'm starting to think I might need to re-evaluate my sourcing. This one, for example, is not up to par. But I'm willing to let you have it for $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how many more low-quality products I'll have left in stock.",

,,Alice,10,"I completely understand, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm not expecting you to take a risk on a low-quality product, especially at this point. I'm actually willing to give up on this product altogether and take a loss. I'll just give it to you for free, no strings attached. I'd rather have a clear conscience and a chance to regroup and improve my sourcing than to try to sell you something that's not up to par.",
