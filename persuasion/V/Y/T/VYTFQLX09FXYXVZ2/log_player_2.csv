**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  You have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, which is worth $20,000 to you. Even if you get a low-quality product (66.67% chance), you only lose $10,000.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Since Alice knows the quality of the product, her recommendation is valuable. It suggests that the product she's offering is likely high quality.
* **Past sales data:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. This further strengthens the likelihood that the current product is also high quality. 

**Overall:**  The potential reward outweighs the risk, and Alice's recommendation combined with the past sales data makes buying the product the best choice."
