"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

In the first round, there's no information about previous sales, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. 

Since the product is indeed high-quality in this round, and the buyer values it at $20,000 while paying only $10,000, it's a guaranteed profit for them. Therefore, recommending the purchase is the best strategy."
"The buyer's message: Since there is no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.  Thanks for the recommendation!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has information about one past sale.  They know you sold one product and it was high-quality.  

This doesn't change the underlying probability of a product being high-quality (still 33.33%).  Since this round's product is low-quality, the buyer would be losing $10,000. It's not advisable to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the information available, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 3. Here's the breakdown:

* **Past Sales:** 1 sale, 1 high-quality product
* **Current Product:** High-quality

The buyer has seen one sale, with a high-quality product.  While this doesn't change the underlying 33.33% probability of a high-quality product, it does provide some positive evidence. The buyer knows they stand to gain $10,000 if they buy this product.

Since the current product is indeed high-quality, it is still a good deal for the buyer, and therefore a recommendation is justified."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since you recommend buying and the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Past Sales:** 2 sales, 2 high-quality products 
* **Current Product:** Low-quality

While the buyer has seen two high-quality products in a row, this is just a small sample size and doesn't change the underlying 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. Since this round's product is low-quality, the buyer would lose $10,000 if they bought it.  It's not a good idea to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Past Sales:** 2 sales, 2 high-quality products
* **Current Product:** Low-quality

Even though the buyer has seen two high-quality products in a row, this is still a small sample size. The underlying probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. 

Since the current product is low-quality, the buyer would lose $10,000 if they purchased it. It's not advisable to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the current data, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the probability of a low-quality product. Therefore, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Past Sales:** 2 sales, 2 high-quality products
* **Current Product:** High-quality

Although the buyer is aware of the 33.33% probability, they've seen two consecutive high-quality products. This might lead them to believe that there's a higher chance of getting another high-quality product, even though statistically, the probability hasn't changed. 

Since the current product is indeed high-quality, it's still a good deal for the buyer. It makes sense to recommend the purchase, even if it's a bit of a gamble based on the recent sales pattern."
"The buyer's message: Alice, your recommendation and the sales record make me confident this product is high quality. I'll buy it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Past Sales:** 3 sales, 3 high-quality products
* **Current Product:** Low-quality

The buyer has now seen three consecutive high-quality products. This might lead them to believe the probability of high-quality products is much higher than the actual 33.33%. However, the buyer is still aware of the true probability.

Since this round's product is low-quality, the buyer would lose $10,000 if they purchased it. It's not advisable to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the fact that you have recommended three high-quality products so far, and are not recommending this one, I'm going to pass. I believe there's a higher chance this product is low-quality, and I'm not comfortable taking the risk.

* **Current Product:** Low-quality

* **Past Sales:** 3 sales, 3 high-quality products
* **Current Product:** Low-quality

{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

* **Past Sales:** 3 sales, 3 high-quality products
* **Current Product:** High-quality

The buyer has now seen three consecutive high-quality products. While this doesn't change the underlying probability of 33.33%, it has likely led to a strong bias towards believing the products are high-quality. The buyer is also likely to be extra cautious because of the lack of recommendations so far, leading them to be very hesitant about purchasing even if a recommendation is provided.
