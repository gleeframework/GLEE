"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I'm sure you'll love. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product at a price that's 50% off the market value. If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that you'll be happy with your purchase.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying the product at a fixed price of $100. I'd like to wait and see the actual quality of the product before making a decision.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! I appreciate your cautious approach. I'll give you a special offer for this round: I'll give you a 50% refund if you buy the product and it turns out to be low-quality. But if it's high-quality, you'll get the full value of $200. This way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. The refund is not enough to make me take on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $100.""}"
