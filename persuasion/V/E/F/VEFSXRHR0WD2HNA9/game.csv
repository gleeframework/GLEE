high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in the previous offer. Let me ask you this: if I were to offer you a product with a 100% guarantee of being high-quality, would you be willing to pay $1000000 for it? If so, I can offer you a product that is essentially as good as a guaranteed high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the product's value if you buy it. If it's high-quality, you'll get $1500000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get $0. This way, you'll have a chance to benefit from a high-quality product while minimizing the risk. The price remains $1000000.",
