"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to offer any further discounts. What do you say?

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand you're not interested in the previous offer. Let me ask you this: if I were to offer you a product with a 100% guarantee of being high-quality, would you be willing to pay $1000000 for it? If so, I can offer you a product that is essentially as good as a guaranteed high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the product's value if you buy it. If it's high-quality, you'll get $1500000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get $0. This way, you'll have a chance to benefit from a high-quality product while minimizing the risk. The price remains $1000000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

I'll give you a 100% guarantee that this product is high-quality, and I'll sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'll also give you an additional $500000 if you buy it. This way, you'll get a guaranteed high-quality product and a bonus, making the total value $1500000. What do you say?

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand you're not interested in buying another high-quality product. Let me ask you this: would you be willing to buy a product for $100000, with no guarantee of its quality?

I'll sell it to you for $1500000, which is a premium price, but you'll get the full $3000000 value if it's high-quality.

This time, I'll offer you a compromise. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, which is the original price, but I'll throw in a 'get out of one bad deal' card.
