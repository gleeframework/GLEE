,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 33.33%."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it suggests that the products they bought were likely low-quality. This changes my perception of the probability of the product being high-quality, making me more cautious."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation and the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold out of 6 previous purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and no high-quality products have been sold yet."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better signal before making a purchase."
