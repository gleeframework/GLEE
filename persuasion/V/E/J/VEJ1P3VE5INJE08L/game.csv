,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious, but I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I'll give you a unique opportunity to verify its quality. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special inspection report that confirms its high-quality status. This report will be valid for all future products, so you can trust that any product you buy from me after this will be high-quality. The price remains $100, but I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying the product, and I don't think I need a special inspection report to verify its quality. I'll wait and see the quality of the next product.",no

high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm starting to think you're a savvy buyer, and I respect that. Let me make it even more straightforward. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that it's high-quality. If it's not, I'll give you a product that's worth $300 in its place. You'll get the better of the two, no questions asked. The price remains $100, but I think you'll find it a fair deal.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the guarantee. If you're so confident in the product's quality, why not just sell it to me at the guaranteed high-quality price of $300?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a tough negotiator, and I respect that. Let me be transparent with you. This product is not high-quality, and I'm willing to be upfront about it. However, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. I know it's not worth $300, but I'm willing to let it go for a low price. It's a chance to get a product for a steal, and I think it's a fair deal.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,

I'll sell it to you for $150, which is a 50% discount from the normal price. However, if you buy this product, I'll throw in a second high-quality product for free. This way, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. It's a deal that's hard to pass up, don't you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's being offered to me at a discounted price, especially when I don't know if it's high-quality or not. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is not high-quality. I'm being completely honest with you. But I want to make it worth your while to take a chance. If you buy this product, I'll give you a $50 gift card that you can use on a future purchase. It's a way to get something out of it, even if the product itself isn't worth much. The price remains $100, but I think the gift card makes it a more attractive offer.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a gift card. I'd rather wait and see the quality of the next product.",no

,,Alice,8,"I'm not going to try to sell you on the quality of this product. I'm just going to be honest with you. This product is not worth $100, and I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise. But I'll make you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you $50 cash back, on top of the $100 you paid. So, you'll essentially be getting the product for $50. It's not a great product, but it's a way to get something for a low price.",
