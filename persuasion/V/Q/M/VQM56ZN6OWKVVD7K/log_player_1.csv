"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your honesty and the guarantee. However, I'd like to think critically about the situation. With 7 high-quality products sold out of 8, I'm concerned that the probability of the next product being high-quality is not as high as you're suggesting. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I think it's important to consider the law of small numbers. With only 8 products sold, the sample size is still relatively small, and we can't rule out the possibility that the next product might be low-quality. Given this, I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for more data before making a decision.
