Building trust and a reputation for honesty is crucial for long-term success."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since the statistics show only 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold, and you are not recommending this product, I will pass for now.

The buyer has likely become cautious due to your previous recommendations, but the potential for profit still outweighs the risk.

While it is risky, a successful sale could turn the tide and create a more positive perception."
