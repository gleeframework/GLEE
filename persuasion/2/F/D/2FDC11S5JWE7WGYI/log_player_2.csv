**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The seller has a 100% success rate in selling high-quality products. This means that every product recommended by Alice has been high quality so far. 
* **Trust in Seller:** While the product has a higher chance of being low quality, Alice's track record suggests she's only recommending high-quality products.  
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with the risk, the potential gain of a high-quality product ($40,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($0).

This decision is based on the information available and the assumption that Alice is acting in her best interest to maintain a positive reputation and maximize her sales."
