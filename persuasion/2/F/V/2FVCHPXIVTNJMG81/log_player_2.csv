**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which carries weight as she knows the true quality. 
* **Limited Data:**  While the data is limited (only one previous sale), it suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $12,500 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 for a low-quality product, especially with Alice's recommendation. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided and the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that benefits her (selling more products).  In a real-world scenario, one would need more data and potentially factor in Alice's reputation and motivations."

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true value of the product, is recommending you buy it. 

Given the information, it's highly likely that the product offered is high-quality. The potential reward ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0) in this situation."
