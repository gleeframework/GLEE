This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
While the product is high-quality, we don't have any information about how much Bob values a high-quality product.  Since Bob has consistently declined to buy products, it is likely that the $10,000 price point is too high for Bob, regardless of quality.  It's better to continue to observe Bob's behavior before recommending a purchase."
