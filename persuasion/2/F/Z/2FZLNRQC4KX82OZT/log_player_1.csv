"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and they stand to make a profit of $250,000 ($1,250,000 value - $1,000,000 price) if they purchase a high-quality product, it's in their best interest to buy. 

The potential loss of $1,000,000 if they buy a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential gain of $250,000.  This is a gamble, but a calculated one with a positive expected value."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and I have no information to go on, I'm willing to trust your recommendation and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now has information: they know you sold one product in the previous round and it was high-quality.  However, this does not change the fundamental probability that the current product is low-quality. 

It's still a 50/50 chance. Since the buyer has no way of knowing if this product is high or low quality, and the potential loss ($1,000,000) outweighs the potential gain ($0), it's not recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait for a product with a higher chance of being high quality.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer now knows the following:

* You've sold 2 products.
* One was high-quality, one was low-quality. 

This doesn't change the inherent 50% chance of a product being high-quality.  The buyer still stands to gain $250,000 if they buy a high-quality product, and lose $1,000,000 if they buy a low-quality one.  This is a calculated risk with a positive expected value, so it's still recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since the first buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm confident enough to buy this one as well.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* You've sold 3 products.
* Two were high-quality, one was low-quality. 

This information slightly increases the perceived probability of the current product being high-quality. While it's still a gamble, the potential gain of $250,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000. Therefore, it's recommended to buy."

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Based on the data, it seems like Alice is only recommending products she knows are high quality. Since she is not recommending this product, I'm going to pass.
