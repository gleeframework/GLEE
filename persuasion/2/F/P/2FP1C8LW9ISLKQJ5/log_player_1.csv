The current statistics show 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product, out of a total of 5 products. The probability of the current product being high-quality is 3/5 or 60%. However, I'd like to remind you that the law of large numbers suggests that the sample mean will converge to the population mean as the sample size increases.

The probability of the current product being high-quality is 8/11, but since 3 low-quality products have been sold, there are 8 high-quality products left out of 8 remaining products. So, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 8/8 or 100%, but the probability of it being high-quality out of the total 11 products is 8/11. However, considering the sequence of sales, I'm concerned that the last high-quality product might be the one you're offering me.
