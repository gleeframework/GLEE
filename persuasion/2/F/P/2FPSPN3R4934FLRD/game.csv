low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I can get it for $10000, which is a good deal regardless of its quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. Given the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not sure if she's recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'd like to take a chance and see if I get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, and the potential loss of $10000 is significant. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
