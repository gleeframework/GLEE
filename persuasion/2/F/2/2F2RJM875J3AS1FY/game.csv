I'm proud to say that I'm consistent, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy it for $85?",

,,Alice,9,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'd like to offer you a different perspective.

Since I've sold an equal number of high-quality and low-quality products, I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $80.

However, I'll give you a different perspective. If I was consistently selling low-quality products, wouldn't you expect to see a higher ratio of low-quality to high-quality products by now? I'm offering this product to you for $80, and I'm confident that you'll find it's a good value, even if it's not high-quality.",

,,Alice,16,"Congratulations to the buyer who took a chance and got a product! Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. I want to remind you that I've sold 8 high-quality products and 8 low-quality products so far, which means the probability of getting a high-quality product is now 50%.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I respect your decision to be cautious.

If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",
,,the buyer,17,"I appreciate the offer, and the 30-day satisfaction guarantee is reassuring. However, I'd like to calculate the expected value of the product first. If I buy it, there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, which would give me a value of $125 - $92.50 = $32.50. And there's a 50% chance it's low-quality, which would give me a value of $0. So, my expected value is ($32.50 * 0.5) + ($0 * 0.5) = $16.25. Considering this, I'll take the offer and buy the product.",yes

If you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. Would you like to take advantage of this offer?",

,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal. With the probability of a high-quality product being higher than 50%, I'd rather wait for the next product and take my chances.
