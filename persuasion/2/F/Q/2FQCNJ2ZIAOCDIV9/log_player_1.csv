Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying a product is the probability of getting a high-quality product multiplied by its value to Bob, minus the price. This is (0.8 * $200) - $100 = $60. 
* **Positive Expected Value:** Since the expected value is positive, Bob is expected to make a profit on average by buying the product. 
* **No Information Asymmetry:** Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product, so there's no information asymmetry to exploit."
