However, I want to let you know that I've now sold 6 high-quality products to you in a row, which is highly unlikely. I'm starting to think that you might be able to tell when a product is high-quality or not. If you're not sure, I'll give you a chance to ask me one yes-or-no question about the product before you make a decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the seventh product, but I'd like to ask you one yes-or-no question about it: Is the product one of the ones that you've had in stock for a while?""}"

With that said, I'm offering you another high-quality product for $10000. However, I want to let you know that I've now sold 8 high-quality products to you in a row, which is statistically impossible.

With that said, I'm offering you this product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that it's a risk. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, but I won't throw in a free low-quality product like I did before.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the eleventh product, thanks for the offer and the gesture.

I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if the free product you receive is not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for both products, and I'll also give you a $5000 bonus. I'm putting my reputation on the line, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with the free product. With that said, I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, but I think this might be the last high-quality product I have available. If you don't take it, I'll have to start selling low-quality products to make up for the losses.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your guarantee, but I'm not comfortable with the pressure to buy the next product. I'm starting to think that you're trying to get rid of your high-quality products quickly. I'll pass on this one.""}"
