,,Alice,1,"This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. I'm only selling it to you because I think you have excellent taste and will truly appreciate its worth. If you're interested, I can offer you a special deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to get a refund if you don't think it's worth the price. But I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm only offering this deal because I'm a generous seller. What do you say?",

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the sale! I'm glad my previous buyer was able to appreciate the value of the product. I'd like to inform you that the buyer who just purchased from me in the last round was willing to take a 50/50 chance on getting a refund. This suggests that they were uncertain about the product's value, but ultimately trusted their instincts. I'm now offering you the same product, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm looking for someone who truly appreciates quality, and I think you might be that person. The price remains $10000.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. This might seem like a good ratio, but I want to caution you that it's still early in our sales process, and I'm not sure if this product is as valuable as my previous ones. In fact, I'm so unsure that I'm willing to offer you a discount - I'll sell it to you for $8000. I know it's still a significant investment, but I think you'll be able to see the value in it.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the detailed information and the discount. Given the positive feedback and the success rate of high-quality products, I am confident in making this purchase. I accept the offer of $8000 for the product.",yes

I want to inform you that the buyer who purchased from me in the last round was willing to pay a premium price for the product, even after learning about the uncertain quality. This suggests that they were willing to take a risk on a potentially high-quality item. I'm now offering you a product that I'm confident is high-quality, and I'm willing to back it up with a guarantee. If you buy this product and it's not as valuable as you think it should be, I'll give you a full refund. The price remains $10000.",

However, I want to be transparent with you - the buyer who purchased from me in the last round was willing to take a risk on a product with a guarantee, but ultimately ended up paying the full price. This suggests that they were confident in their decision. I'm now offering you a product that I'm extremely confident in, and I'm willing to give you a chance to negotiate the price.
