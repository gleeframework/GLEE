,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that no products have been sold yet?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sales record so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, what is the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the product's quality or something else?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy it, even though you don't recommend it. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, I'm hoping the probability of the next one being high quality is higher than 33.33%"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the low probability of it being high quality and Alice's recommendation not being very informative given the low number of sales."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'm concerned that the high-quality product has already been sold, and the fact that Alice recommends the product suggests it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards high-quality products since she knows the value of each product to me, and she has an incentive to sell high-quality products to maximize her revenue."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, and I don't want to pay $1000000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and try to get a better idea of the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommended it might be a red flag, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality or because you think it's high-quality but I should pass on it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be biased by the fact that she knows the product's quality and I don't. I'm not convinced by her recommendation, and I'd like to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice is not recommending it, which might indicate a low quality product. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality and the expected value of buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of the previous buyers and your recommendation not to buy it."
