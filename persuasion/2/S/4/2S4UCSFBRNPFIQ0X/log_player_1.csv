* **Acknowledge your mistakes:**  Be upfront about the shortcomings of your previous recommendations. Apologize for not being more helpful and acknowledge that you were wrong to recommend low-quality products.
* **Offer more information:**  Provide detailed descriptions of your products, highlight features, or even offer guarantees.  This shows Bob that you are serious about providing value.
* **Propose a new approach:**  Suggest a different way to interact. Maybe Bob can choose the type of product he's looking for, or you can offer him a chance to select from a curated set.
* **Offer a genuine benefit:**  Perhaps there's a way to provide a bonus or extra service for those who make a purchase.

Focus on building a positive relationship and demonstrate that you are truly interested in meeting Bob's needs. Until you regain his trust, recommending any product will be futile."
