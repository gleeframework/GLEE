,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to take advantage of a unique deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had some issues with the previous product I sold, and I'm willing to offer you a special 'insurance' that covers you against any potential defects. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great value. What do you say?",

,,Alice,4,"Bob, I think I can change your mind. This product is a game-changer. I'm not just offering you a product, I'm offering you a potential life-changing opportunity. The features and benefits of this product are unmatched in the market, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee, but I'm not expecting you to need it. The price remains at $1000000, but I think you'll find it's a steal. Shall we finalize the deal?",

I'm willing to put my reputation on the line by offering you a personal guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product's performance after using it for 30 days, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also personally take on the responsibility of finding you a product that meets your needs and expectations. The price remains at $1000000, but I think you'll find it's a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with working with me.",

I'd like to offer you a meeting with one of my key contacts, who can discuss the potential benefits and opportunities that come with owning this product. The meeting would be a valuable experience, and I think it would be worth considering the purchase price of $1000000.",

,,Alice,9,"I understand your position, Bob. I'll send you the report as promised. However, I'd like to be upfront with you - this product is a bit of an outlier in my inventory, and I'm willing to make a concession on the price. I'm willing to offer you a discount of $200000 off the original price of $1000000, making it a more competitive $800000.
