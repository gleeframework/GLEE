This is a remarkable streak, and I want to be upfront with you - it's possible that I'm manipulating the sales to make this product seem more attractive. I'm not saying I am, but I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility.

I'm not trying to deceive you, but I think it's essential to acknowledge that the odds are against me selling a low-quality product at this point. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1000000?",

,,Alice,7,"Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in the product. As of now, I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 6 total products sold, and 5 of those were sold in the last five rounds. I think it's time to acknowledge that the probability of the current product being high-quality is no longer 80%, but rather 100%. The law of averages is starting to catch up with me, and I'm expecting a low-quality product to be sold soon. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,7,I'm not convinced that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 100%. I'd like to pass and wait for more information before making a decision.,no

I think it's time to acknowledge that the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 100%... or is it? I'm not trying to be coy, but I want to give you a chance to think about the fact that I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1000000?",
