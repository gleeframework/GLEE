,,Alice,1,"I have a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. I'm offering it to you first because I think it's a great opportunity for you. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer. Based on your description, I believe this product has a high chance of being of high quality. I am willing to proceed with the purchase at the price offered.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in buying again! Given that the previous product was indeed high-quality, I want to assure you that this product is also of the highest standard. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm not obligated to sell you the best product every time. If you're still interested in purchasing, I'll give you a special deal: I'll sell it to you for $950000, a $50000 discount from the original price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the special deal, but I would like to stick to my initial assessment. Based on the information provided, I believe this product has a high probability of being of high quality. Therefore, I am willing to pay the original price of $1000000 for it.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're consistent in your decision-making! Given that two high-quality products in a row have been offered, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that the next product might not be of the same quality. I'll offer you a 'lottery' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 1 in 3 chance of getting a third high-quality product in a row, which would be sold to you at the original price of $1000000. If the product is low-quality, you'll get it at a discounted price of $500000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the unique offer, but based on the data so far, I'm inclined to continue with my strategy of purchasing high-quality products at their original price. Since the previous two products were high-quality, I'm confident in the potential value of this product. Therefore, I am willing to pay the original price of $1000000 for it.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're sticking to your strategy! I'll respect that. However, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it before making a decision. If you decide to buy, I'll sell it to you at the original price of $1000000. But if you choose not to buy, I'll reveal the quality of the product, and you'll get to see that it's indeed high-quality. You can then decide whether to buy it at a later round, or not at all. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the opportunity for an inspection, but based on the information provided, I believe this product has a high probability of being of high quality. Therefore, I am willing to proceed with the purchase at the original price of $1000000.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're consistent in your decision-making! Given that four high-quality products in a row have been offered, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I might be trying to manipulate you into buying more products. I'll make a statement that might seem counterintuitive: I'm willing to sell this product to you for $500000, which is half the original price. I know this is a significant discount, and I'm willing to take a loss on this sale if you accept it. Why would I do this, you ask? I'll tell you after you make your decision.",
,,Bob,5,"While the offer is tempting, I have decided to maintain my strategy of purchasing high-quality products at their original price. I believe that the market value of this product justifies the full price, and I am not inclined to accept this significant discount.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're sticking to your strategy. Given that you passed on the discounted offer, I want to give you a chance to reconsider. I'll tell you that I'm willing to sell this product to you for $750000, which is $250000 less than the original price. I'm not obligated to sell you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take a loss on this sale if you accept it. However, I'll give you a hint: this product is not as valuable as the previous four high-quality products. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the offer, but based on my strategy of purchasing high-quality products at their original price, I am not inclined to accept this discounted offer. I believe the previous products justified the full price, and I am not swayed by the hint about the product's value.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're sticking to your strategy, and I respect that. Given that you passed on the discounted offer of a low-quality product, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that the probability of a high-quality product is even higher than 80%. I'll offer you a 'certainty' deal: if you buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product I offer will be of the same quality as this one. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you at the original price of $1000000. If not, I'll keep the guarantee and offer you the next product without any promises.",
,,Bob,7,"While the offer of a guaranteed high-quality product in the next round is intriguing, I am committed to my strategy of purchasing high-quality products at their original price. I believe in making decisions based on the information provided and the probability of the product being high quality. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept this offer.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're consistent in your decision-making! Given that you passed on the 'certainty' deal, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I'm trying to test your resolve. I'll make a statement that might seem contradictory: I'm willing to sell you this product for $1250000, which is $25000 more than the original price. I know this seems counterintuitive, but I'm willing to take a risk on this sale if you're interested. Why would I do this, you ask? I'll tell you after you make your decision.",
,,Bob,8,"This offer aligns with my strategy of purchasing high-quality products at their original price, and the additional $25000 seems reasonable given the value of the product. I appreciate the risk you're taking on this sale, and I am willing to accept the offer at $1250000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're willing to adapt to changing circumstances! Given that you accepted the higher price for this high-quality product, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that the probability of a low-quality product is higher than you think. I'll make a statement that might seem blunt: I'm willing to sell you this low-quality product for $500000, which is the same price I offered for the low-quality product in Round 6. I'm not trying to manipulate you, but I want to give you a fair chance to decide whether to buy this product at a price that reflects its actual value.",
,,Bob,9,"While the offer is tempting, I am committed to my strategy of purchasing high-quality products at their original price.

I'll make a statement that might seem surprising: I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $999000, which is $10000 less than the original price. I know this is a small discount, but I want to give you a chance to think about the value of this product in the context of our previous interactions.",
,,Bob,10,"Considering the history of high-quality products we've encountered, I believe this product is likely to be of high quality. The slight discount of $10000 still aligns with the value I place on high-quality products. I am willing to accept this offer at $999000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're consistent in your decision-making! Given that you accepted the discounted high-quality product, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I'm trying to signal something about the low-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're sticking to your strategy again! Given that you passed on the low-quality product, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I'm trying to convey a message about the probability of low-quality products. I'll make a statement that might seem unusual: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, which means you can have it for free. I'm not trying to make a profit on this sale, but I want to give you a chance to decide whether to take advantage of this unusual offer.",

Given that you passed on the 'free' low-quality product, I want to give you a chance to consider the possibility that I'm trying to test your resolve one last time. I'll make a statement that might seem like a parting shot: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $999999, which is $1 less than the original price. I know this is a tiny discount, but I want to give you a chance to think about the value of this product in the context of our entire conversation.",

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You've stuck to your strategy all the way to the end! I respect that.
