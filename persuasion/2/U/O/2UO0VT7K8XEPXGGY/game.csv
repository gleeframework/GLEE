,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have purchased the products so far and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the 3 previous buyers who purchased the products?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, considering the previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough to purchase, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the sold products were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the products being sold are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better experience."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 3 buyers purchased high-quality products. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is of higher quality.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This increases my suspicion that the product I'm being offered might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
