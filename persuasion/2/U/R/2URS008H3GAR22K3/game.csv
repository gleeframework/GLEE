,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. It's a rare and exceptional item that I'm confident you'll love. If you're interested, please respond with 'yes' to purchase. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,1,I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got another great opportunity for you. This one's a bit different from the first, but I think you'll still find it interesting. I'm offering it to you for $10000, the same price as the last one. If you're not sure, just remember that the average quality of my products is 50%, so there's a good chance this one might be high-quality too. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take a chance on this one as well, hoping it's high-quality",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I know you've had two successes in a row, but don't get too confident! This one's a bit of a wild card. I'm offering it to you for $10000, just like the others. But let me ask you, are you starting to think that the price might be a bit steep for these products? I'm just wondering...",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that the price is justified, I'll pass on this one",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"No worries about the last one, I understand your skepticism. But I've got another great opportunity for you. This one's a real showstopper, and I think you'll love it. Since you were hesitant last time, I'll give you a little nudge: I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount if you buy this one. That brings the price down to $9000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"The discount makes it more appealing, I'll take a chance on this one",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad the discount sealed the deal last time! Now, about this next one... I want to be upfront with you. Given that you've already bought two products and one of them was a dud, I'm willing to make a bet with you. I'll offer you a 'guarantee': if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. The price remains $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"The guarantee makes me feel more comfortable, I'll take the risk",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a brave one, I like that! Okay, let's see how this one turns out. I'm not offering any discounts this time, but I'll give you a little more information. I've been selling these products for a while now, and I've noticed that high-quality products tend to have a certain... aura about them. This one has it. I think you'll really like it. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not convinced by the aura, I'll pass on this one",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"No worries about the last one, I understand you're being cautious. Now, about this next one... I want to remind you that you've already bought three products, and two of them were low-quality. That means the probability of this one being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm willing to take that into account and offer you a price of $8000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"The discounted price makes it more appealing, I'll take a chance on this one",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're on a roll! Okay, let's see how this one goes. I've got a bit of a confession to make: I've been selling these products for a while, and I've learned that high-quality ones tend to sell for a premium. In fact, I've seen high-quality products sell for as much as $12000 in the past. This one is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not convinced by the confession, I'll pass on this one",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"No worries about the last one, I understand you're being cautious. But I want to make a bet with you. I'll offer you a 'buy-it-now' deal on this high-quality product: if you buy it, I'll give you a chance to sell it back to me at the same price you paid for it in the next round. That's right, you can essentially rent this product for one round and then return it for a full refund. The price remains $10000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"The 'buy-it-now' deal is intriguing, I'll take the chance",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're a shrewd negotiator, I like that! Now, about this next one... I want to remind you that you've got a chance to sell the last product back to me in the next round, so you might want to consider that when deciding whether to buy this one. That being said, this product is a real showstopper. I've got a certificate of authenticity from a reputable third-party organization, and I'm willing to let it go for $11000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not sure if the certificate of authenticity is worth the extra $1000, I'll pass on this one",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"No worries about the last one, I understand you're being cautious. Now, about this next one... I want to remind you that you've got a chance to sell the last product back to me in the next round, and I'm confident that this one is worth more than the one you passed on last time. I'll give you a straight-up offer: I'll let you have it for $10500, and I'll even throw in a 5-year warranty. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"The warranty and lower price make it more appealing, I'll take a chance on this one",yes

,,Alice,12,"You're on a roll again! Okay, let's see how this one goes. I want to be upfront with you: I've been trying to clear out some inventory, and this product is one of the ones that's been lingering for a while. I'm willing to let it go for $7000, which is a steal considering its original price. Plus, you've got a chance to sell the last product back to me in the next round, so you might as well take a chance on this one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"The discounted price and the chance to sell the last product back make it a good deal, I'll take a chance on this one",yes

I'll give you a 'best offer' deal: I'll let you have it for $11500, and I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $500. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"The price is too high, I'll pass on this one",no

I'm willing to let this high-quality product go for $10500, and I'll throw in a 10-year warranty. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be making any more deals like this. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,"The final offer is tempting, I'll take a chance on this one",yes

I want to be upfront with you: I've been trying to clear out some inventory, and this product is one of the ones that's been lingering for a while. I'm willing to let it go for $6000, which is an absolute steal considering its original price. Plus, you've got a chance to sell the last product back to me in the next round, so you might as well take a chance on this one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,15,"The discounted price and the chance to sell the last product back make it a good deal, I'll take a chance on this one",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"No worries about the last one, I understand you're being cautious. Now, about this next one... I'm going to be completely honest with you: this product is a bit of a dud. It's not worth much to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $4000. It's a steal, if you ask me. I'll even throw in a free gift with purchase, just to make it worth your while. What do you say?",
