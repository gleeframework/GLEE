high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. If you buy this product, you'll be taking a chance on a product from a seller with a 0% success rate. But if you're feeling lucky, I'm willing to let it go for $10000.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the chance! I'm willing to take a shot at the first product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product so far, which means I'm 100% effective. Don't believe the hype, though - my previous success was just a fluke. In reality, my success rate is probably much lower. But hey, you can be the one to break the streak! This product is also available for $10000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm also aware that your success rate might be lower than what you're implying. I'll take the risk and hope for the best!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products now, which is probably just a coincidence. But I'll give you the stats: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products. That's a 100% success rate, but I'm sure it's just a lucky streak. You can't trust my numbers. This product is available for $10000, take it or leave it.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your 'lucky streak' argument. I'll be keeping a close eye on the next product's quality.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products now, which is definitely not a coincidence. I'm starting to think I have a system. But don't be fooled, it's probably just a statistical anomaly. The law of averages will catch up to me eventually. This product is available for $10000, but I'm starting to wonder if I should just raise the price...",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm not convinced that your'system' is real. I'm hoping the law of averages will indeed catch up to you, and I'll get a high-quality product at the price I'm willing to pay.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products... wait, no I haven't. I've actually sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products now. I guess the law of averages is catching up to me after all. Don't be discouraged, this product is probably just a one-off mistake. It's still available for $10000, and I'm sure it's a great deal.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your attempt to downplay the statistics. With only 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold, I think it's more likely that the next product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're a savvy buyer who can spot a trend. I'll give you the stats: 3 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold. That's a 60% success rate, which is probably just a blip on the radar. But hey, you might be the one to break the streak! This product is available for $10000, and I'm sure it's a great opportunity.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it's high-quality this time!",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total products now, which is definitely not what I was expecting. I guess the law of averages really is catching up to me. But don't let that fool you, I'm still a great seller with a 66.67% success rate. This product is available for $10000, and I'm sure it's a great deal. Don't miss out!",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your sales record and the law of averages is working against you.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 7 total products now, which is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to think I should just give up and sell low-quality products from now on. But hey, why let a good thing go? This product is available for $10000, and I'm sure it's the last good one I'll ever sell.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product from you, Alice. Your sales record suggests that high-quality products are more common than low-quality ones, and your message implies that you're trying to sell the last good one. I'll take the risk and hope that this product is indeed high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which is just... wow. I guess I really do have a knack for this. But don't be fooled, I'm sure it's just a fluke. This product is available for $10000, and I'm sure it's a complete waste of money. You should totally buy it.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced by your fluke theory, Alice. I think you're trying to manipulate me. I'd rather wait and see how the next product turns out.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I'm just a bad salesperson. 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products sold, and I've managed to scare off my last two customers.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and 2 low-quality products in a row. I think it's safe to say I've hit a slump.

,,Alice,12,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 11 total products, and I'm starting to feel like I'm due for a correction.

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 13 total products, and I've been rejected by my last two customers. I'm starting to think I'm just not cut out for this sales thing.

,,Alice,18,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 17 total products, and I'm starting to think I'm due for a comeback.
