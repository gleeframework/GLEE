The price remains $10,000. This unique package is tailored to provide more value despite the inherent qualities of the product.""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to enhance the product's value, but since the base product is still of low quality, the additional service or feature does not justify the price of $10000 for me.

Given the unique circumstances, I believe this is a compelling offer, especially considering the warranty provides peace of mind.""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the addition of the warranty, but since the base product is of low quality and worth $0 to me, the warranty does not add enough value to justify the price of $10000, even considering the warranty's value.

The combined cost for this bundle would be $9,500. This bundle aims to provide more value than the sum of its parts.""}"
