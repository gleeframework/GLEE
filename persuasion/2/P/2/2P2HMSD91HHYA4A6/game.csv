,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the general probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $12500 and the price is $10000, the potential gain is $2500. However, considering the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality and worth $0, the risk outweighs the potential gain. I'll pass on this one."
