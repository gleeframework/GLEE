A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has now seen one product (which was high-quality) and is willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Since you know this round's product is also high-quality, it's still a good bet to recommend the purchase.  You don't have enough information to know if the buyer will consistently buy high-quality products at this price, but this single data point is positive."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Given the high percentage of high-quality products sold so far, I am confident in purchasing this product.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While you have no information about the buyer's valuation of low-quality products, the buyer's past behavior is a strong indicator. They bought two high-quality products at $1,000,000 each. This implies they are likely to only buy products they believe are worth at least that much.  Therefore, it's highly probable they will not buy a low-quality product at this price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Based on the seller's recommendation and the fact that two high-quality products have already been sold, I'm going to pass on this product. It seems likely that this product is low quality, and I don't want to risk the loss.

Therefore, it's reasonable to recommend the purchase of this high-quality product."
