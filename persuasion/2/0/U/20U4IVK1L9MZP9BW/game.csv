high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to buy a product that has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.

,,Alice,2,"I have sold 1 product so far, and I can confirm that it was high-quality. Now, I'm offering you another product.

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them were high-quality. However, I must remind you that the initial probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and each product's quality is independent of the others. Don't assume that my previous sales guarantee the quality of this product. Make your decision based on the given probability.",

The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. Make your decision based on this information.",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality. However, I must correct the assumption made by the previous buyer - my last three sales were actually low-quality products. But, as the seller, I can assure you that this new product is being offered with the same 33.33% probability of being high-quality. Consider this information and make your decision accordingly.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that the previous three sales were low-quality, I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which is still worth it to me at $12500. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'm hoping the odds are in my favor.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 products so far, with 3 of them being high-quality. However, my last two sales had a high-quality product followed by a low-quality product that the buyer thought had a higher chance of being high-quality. And now this product I am selling has the same 33.33% probability of being high-quality as the others. Don't be misled by any perceived patterns - each product's quality is independent.
