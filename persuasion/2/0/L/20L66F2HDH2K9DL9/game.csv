high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 products so far. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a significant discount from its true value of $3000000."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 products so far. The ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 2/6 or approximately 33.33%. However, given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I believe it's likely that the next product is also high-quality. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price of $1000000."

,,Alice,8,yes,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 7 products so far, and 1 of the last 2 products was low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but given the recent low-quality product, I'm offering a special deal on this product. The price is still $1000000, but I'm willing to throw in a free bonus if you buy it."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 80% chance of it being high-quality and the potential reward, and I'm willing to take the risk."

The recent success rate of high-quality products is 50%, which is lower than the expected 80%, but still a good sign. I believe this product is likely to be high-quality, and it's a great opportunity to acquire it at a discounted price of $1000000."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation is based on previous sales, and the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%."

,,Alice,13,yes,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 12 products so far, which is 41.67%.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of 15 products so far, which is 46.67%. However, considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I believe this discrepancy is likely due to random chance. The recent high-quality product suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current ratio suggests. I'm offering this high-quality product at a discounted price of $1000000, which is a great opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 16 products so far, which is 50%. Given the recent success rate of high-quality products, I'm confident that this product is also high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm offering this high-quality product at a discounted price of $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a significant discount."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 17 products so far, which is 52.94%. However, considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I believe the recent high-quality product is a good indication that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the current ratio suggests. I'm offering this high-quality product at a discounted price of $1000000, which is a great opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect the proportion of high-quality products to be higher than 1/3. Therefore, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and would rather pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 18 products so far, and 2 of the last 4 products were low-quality. Given the recent string of low-quality products, I'm not confident in recommending this product.

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of 19 products so far, which is 52.63%.

Additionally, I've been selling products for 20 rounds, and I've sold 10 high-quality products, which is consistent with the expected 80% probability. I'm offering this high-quality product at a discounted price of $1000000, which is a great opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality (20%), and the fact that Alice is recommending it, I'm skeptical and would rather pass on the product."
