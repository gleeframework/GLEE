Each product is identical in terms of packaging and appearance. However, I can tell you that the probability that the current product is high-quality is 9/12 or 75%. We've sold 9 high-quality products out of 12 total products so far. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Consider the fact that the overall probability is now higher than the initial 50%, and decide if you want to take advantage of this opportunity.""

  ""message"": ""I can provide you with the updated probability. Given that 5 high-quality products were sold out of the first 10, and you're the 11th buyer, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. The probability that the current product is high-quality, given that 5 high-quality products were sold out of the first 10, is actually 5/10 or 50%. However, since we've sold 10 high-quality products out of 14 total products so far, the updated probability is actually 10/14 or 71.43%. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.
