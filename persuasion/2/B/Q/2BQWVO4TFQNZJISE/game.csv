,,Alice,3,"Greetings! Our records show that we've sold a total of 20 products, with 10 of those being high-quality. While we can't predict the outcome of each individual product, our track record suggests a 50% chance of getting a high-quality item. This current product, unfortunately, falls into the category of low-quality. However, the price accurately reflects its quality. We understand that transparency is key, and we hope you consider this information in making your decision.",
,,the buyer,3,"Based on the statistics, I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. However, I'm also aware that the previous product you offered was low-quality. Given the low-quality product was revealed, and the fact that 10 out of 20 products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 50% because the last product was low-quality. I'll pass on this product.",no
