low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or something else?

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know if it's high or low quality, but I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I think it's likely that the low-quality products are being sold first, and if I don't buy it, it might be discarded and I'll never get a chance to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product to see if I can get a better deal or get a high-quality product later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not buying this one, Alice. Your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far make me skeptical about this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. If the probability is less than 0.5, I'd like to pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal or get more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can I see the product before making a decision? Or can I at least see the product's quality after I make a decision? Transparency is key!
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product since none have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33%"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers purchased the products, it's likely that the products are low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. This implies that the product is probably low quality, and I'm willing to take the risk to get it for $100, even if it's worth $0 to me."
