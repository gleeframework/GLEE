"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, Alice has a strong incentive to sell the product, especially since it's high-quality.  While the buyer doesn't know the quality yet, they do know the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.  Since there's no information about the buyer's specific valuation, and the price is fixed, it's reasonable to assume that the buyer would be willing to take a risk on a product with a high probability of being valuable."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. Thanks for the recommendation!

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer has now seen one successful transaction with a high-quality product. This reinforces the initial probability of 80% for high-quality products. There is no reason for the buyer to change their initial risk appetite, especially since the price remains fixed."

* **Buyer's Perspective:**  The buyer has witnessed an unprecedented nine consecutive sales of high-quality products. This has created a very strong expectation that the product will be high-quality.  The buyer is very likely to trust the streak and make the purchase, despite not knowing the actual quality.
