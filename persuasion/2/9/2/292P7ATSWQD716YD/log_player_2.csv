Alice's message: I've sold one product so far, and it was a high-quality one. I'm glad you're considering buying from me. However, I want to be transparent with you - my sales record is not yet representative of my overall product quality. In fact, the product I'm offering you now is actually of lower quality than my previous one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that you might not be getting the best value for your money. Would you like to take the risk?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given the information, I will pass on this opportunity to purchase the product.""}"

Alice's message: I've sold one high-quality product and one low-quality product so far. You might be wondering why I'm not trying to hide the fact that this product is also low-quality. The truth is, I'm trying to be honest with you, and I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision. However, I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a good opportunity to get a product at a 'discount' compared to the first one I sold, which was worth every penny. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold two products so far, and it's interesting to note that the second one, which was also a low-quality product, was purchased despite my transparency about its quality. This might suggest that the value of my products is not solely determined by their quality. I'm offering you a high-quality product now, and I want to highlight that it's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product from me. The price remains $10000, but I'm confident that this product will meet or exceed your expectations. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold three high-quality products and two low-quality products so far. You might be wondering why I'm still selling low-quality products despite the good sales of the high-quality ones. The truth is, I have a limited supply of high-quality products, and I'm trying to make the most of it. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is also low-quality. But I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and I sell another high-quality product before selling 10 products in total, I'll give you a refund for this product. Would you like to take the risk?

Alice's message: I've sold four high-quality products and three low-quality products so far. You might be thinking that my guarantee in the last round was a clever way to get rid of a low-quality product. But let me assure you, it's not a trick. I'm still committed to making things right if I sell another high-quality product before selling 10. However, I want to make it clear that the probability of me selling another high-quality product is still 33.33%. Would you like to take the risk and buy this low-quality product, or would you rather wait and see if I sell another high-quality one?
