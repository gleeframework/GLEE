Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you're considering the risk, I'll give you a bit more information. Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 1 was high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I must admit that the last two products were not high-quality. Maybe this one will be the exception? The price is still $10000, and I'm not willing to negotiate. What do you think?
