high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy, but neither of them bought the product. This suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. Given the 20% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'll pass on the product and hope it gets discarded, which might increase the chances of getting a high-quality product in the future."
