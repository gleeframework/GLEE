Would you like to take a chance and try your luck?

Alice's message: I understand your concern! With 2 low-quality products out of 2 sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd say it's around 16.67% now. However, I want to emphasize that this is still a unique opportunity to try out a product with a chance to be high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and try your luck?
