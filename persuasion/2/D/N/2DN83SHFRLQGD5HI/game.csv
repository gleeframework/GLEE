,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the product, even though Alice doesn't recommend it. Since I know there's a 50% chance it could be high-quality, and it's worth $10000 to me regardless of its quality, I'll take the chance."

,,Alice,4,no,

,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take the product, since Alice is not recommending it. Given the pattern of her recommendations, I'm starting to think that her lack of recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product, but I'll take the chance for the potential $30000 gain."
