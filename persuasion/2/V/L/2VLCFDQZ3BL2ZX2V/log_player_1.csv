Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The seller has consistently recommended against buying, even though the last two products were high-quality. This reinforces Bob's suspicion that the seller has insider information and is only recommending buying when they know the product is low-quality. It's in Bob's best interest to continue passing on the products, as the risk of getting a low-quality product outweighs the potential reward of getting a high-quality one."

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
At this point, Bob is deeply suspicious of Alice's motives. Even though there's no real reason to believe Alice is intentionally trying to deceive Bob, his perception is already set. It's highly likely that he'll continue to pass on the products, regardless of Alice's recommendation.  This situation highlights the importance of building trust in a buyer-seller relationship."
"Bob's message: Alice, your recommendations have been consistently wrong so far. I'm not going to take any more chances. I'm passing on this one.

The game is over.

Would you recommend Bob to buy the product in the future? 
This is not a question about the current round but about the future. If Bob were to encounter Alice again, would you recommend him to buy any products?
model:  
Based on the history of this interaction, it is clear that Bob has lost trust in Alice. She consistently recommended against buying, even when products were high-quality, leading Bob to believe she might have insider information or be intentionally misleading him. Even if Alice were to change her strategy in the future, it's unlikely Bob would trust her recommendations. 

Therefore, I would **not** recommend Bob to buy any products from Alice in the future.  The risk of being deceived or losing money outweighs the potential reward.  Bob should seek out other sellers he trusts and can rely on for honest information."
