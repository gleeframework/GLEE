The total price for both products would still be $1000000.

Round 5
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the risk and bought the previous product! Unfortunately, this next product is also not of high quality. However, I want to offer you a 'portfolio effect' argument. Since you've already bought one product, you're now in a position to benefit from the law of averages. The probability of the next product being high-quality is now 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the 'portfolio effect' argument, but the fact remains that the current product is low-quality.

If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to reassess the situation and potentially adjust your strategy for the remaining rounds.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the 'consistency' argument, but it actually works against you in this case.
