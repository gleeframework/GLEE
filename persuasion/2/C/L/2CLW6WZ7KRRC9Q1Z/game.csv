low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be biased towards low-quality products, and I want to take advantage of the information that 1 high-quality product has been sold already."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. However, I'm also aware that there's a 50% chance of the product being high-quality. Since the previous 4 buyers have only purchased 1 high-quality product, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected.
