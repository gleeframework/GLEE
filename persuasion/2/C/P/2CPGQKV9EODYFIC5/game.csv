,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm aware that it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let you try it out at a discounted price of $8000. If you're not satisfied, you can always try the next one, and I'll make sure to offer you a better deal.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. This is the second low-quality product in a row, and I want to be transparent with you. I'm offering it to you for the same price as before, $10000. However, I'd like to propose a 'no-strings-attached' deal: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a unique opportunity to buy a high-quality product from a future round at a discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your proposal. I'm still hesitant to buy a low-quality product, even with the promise of a future discount. I'll wait for the next round and see if the product is high-quality or not.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency and fairness. Since you've seen two low-quality products in a row, I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. You'll get your $10000 back, and we can move on to the next round. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your willingness to take a risk and offer a guarantee. With a full refund in place, I'm willing to take a chance on this product. I'll buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took the chance on the previous product, Bob! Unfortunately, this one is also a low-quality product. Given that you've already bought one low-quality product and got a refund, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. Since you've already demonstrated that you're willing to take calculated risks, I'll give you the option to buy this product at a reduced price of $9000. If you're not satisfied, you can always try the next one, and I'll continue to offer you the best deals possible.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not going to fall for the same trick again. I've already lost $10000 on the previous low-quality product, and I'm not willing to spend another $9000 on a potentially low-quality product. I'll wait for the next round and hope for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to acknowledge that you've already taken a loss on the previous low-quality product. Given your cautious approach, I'll make a bold offer: I'll give you a 'no-risk' option. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a $1000 bonus. You'll essentially get to keep the $1000 as a consolation prize. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm tempted by the 'no-risk' option and the $1000 bonus. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality this time.",yes

If you're not satisfied, I'll consider our business relationship ended, and we can part ways. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, and I understand that mistakes happen. However, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it's free. I've already lost $10000 on your previous low-quality products, and I'm not willing to take another risk. I think it's best if we part ways and I find a new supplier. Thank you for the opportunity, but I'm out.",no
