**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know this product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **No information about buyer's value:** You don't know how much the buyer values a high-quality product, but it's likely to be positive.
* **No risk for buyer:**  The buyer has no information about this specific product, but they know the price is fixed. Since there's a good chance this product is worth more than the price, the buyer has a potential for profit.

**Recommendation:** In this situation, it's in the seller's best interest to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. The higher the sales volume, the better the seller's potential profit."

* **Potential for loss:** Recommending a low-quality product will likely lead to the buyer being dissatisfied and could damage your future sales. 

**Recommendation:**  The seller should NOT recommend the buyer purchase this product. This is the first instance of a potential negative outcome, and the seller should prioritize building trust and avoiding negative feedback."
