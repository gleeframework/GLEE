,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to learn from my experience and update my decision-making strategy based on the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality based on the current data."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous buyer's experience and your own recommendation. I'd like to wait for more information.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 1 previous buyer was recommended to buy and chose not to, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a 50% discount. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'd like to negotiate the price."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products they were recommended to buy were all low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to be passed on by a buyer, so I can get a better sense of the true quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me given the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with a clear explanation of your recommendation. I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. Can you tell me more about your thought process?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious about your thought process behind not recommending it to me. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer and you don't know how much I value the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice has not recommended the product, and given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to pass on this product. If Alice were confident in the product's quality, she would likely recommend it, given the current statistics."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,I'm going to take a chance despite your recommendation. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the lack of sales so far doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the current product's quality.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 6 failed high-quality product sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to be the exception."
