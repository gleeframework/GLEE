"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, priced at $1000000. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Would you like to purchase it?

**Explanation:**

The product is priced at $1,000,000 and Alice claims it's high-quality. Even if it turns out to be low quality, it's still worth $0 to me. However, if it's actually high-quality, it's worth $3,000,000, making a $2,000,000 profit. It's a high-risk, high-reward situation, but given the potential payoff, it's worth taking the chance."

```

**Explanation:**

"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.
