,,Alice,1,"I have a product for you. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to give you a chance to make an informed decision. I'll give you a hint: if you don't buy this product, I'll offer you another one in the next round. Think carefully before making your decision.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm doing it solely based on the potential value of a high-quality product, not the actual price. If it's low quality, I'll be out $10000, but I'll still learn something about the product's quality, which might help me in future rounds.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you took the risk and bought the first product. Now, I have a high-quality product for you. I'll give you a hint: considering the quality of the first product you bought, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. Think carefully about the value you place on this high-quality product and the potential future savings.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the high-quality product. I value it at $20000, so it's worth it to me. I'm also excited about the potential 10% discount on the next product, which could save me $1000 in the future.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took advantage of the deal. Now, I have another high-quality product for you. Considering you valued the last high-quality product at $20000, I'm going to offer you a different deal. I'll give you a 20% discount on the price of this high-quality product, which would normally be $10000. However, I'll only give you this discount if you buy this product. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the discount offer on the table for the next product, but it will be a 10% discount instead. Think carefully about the value of this high-quality product and the potential savings.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not willing to pay the full $10000 for the high-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next round and potentially get a 10% discount, which would bring the price down to $9000. That's a better deal for me.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision, and I respect your strategy. Since you're willing to wait for the next round, I'll make you a counteroffer. I'll give you the 20% discount on this high-quality product now, but I'll also throw in a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and you'll get to keep the discount. But if it's high-quality, the discount will be applied, and you'll get to keep the product. This way, you'll get the discount either way, and you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at a great price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the high-quality product with the 20% discount and the 'double-or-nothing' guarantee. The potential refund and discount make the risk more acceptable, and I value the high-quality product at $20000, so it's worth it to me.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the risk and bought the product. Now, I have another high-quality product for you. Considering you valued the last high-quality product at $20000 and you're willing to take calculated risks, I'll give you a new offer. I'll give you the 20% discount on this high-quality product, just like before, but this time I'll also throw in a 'best-offer' guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you the opportunity to make an offer on the next product, and if it's lower than the original price of $10000, I'll accept it. This way, you'll have a chance to negotiate a better price, but you'll still get a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the high-quality product with the 20% discount. I value the high-quality product at $20000, and the 'best-offer' guarantee is a nice bonus. I'm willing to pay the discounted price of $8000 ($10000 - 20% = $8000).",yes

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, exactly the price you were willing to pay for the last one. However, I'll also throw in a 'price-match' guarantee. If you buy this product and then see a high-quality product offered for sale in a future round at a lower price, I'll match that price on this product. You'll get the same price you paid, but with the added benefit of having a price-match guarantee. What do you say?",

This way, you'll have the flexibility to upgrade your product and get a better one if you want to. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the high-quality product for $8000. The trade-up option is a nice addition, but I'm still getting a good deal on the product. I value it at $20000, and I'm not expecting to find a higher-quality product in the future. I'll just enjoy this one.",yes

I'll provide you with a certification document that verifies the product's quality and authenticity, which will give you additional peace of mind. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the high-quality product for $8000. The certification guarantee is a nice addition, but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a bit too good of a deal. I value the high-quality product at $20000, and I'm getting it for 60% of its value. I'm not sure if I want to keep taking these deals.",yes
