,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the lack of sales data. I'll buy it and hope it's high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 2 previous buyers having passed on the product, and both being high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than the average. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation to buy. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems unusual that Alice has recommended 2 products and none of them were high-quality. This might indicate that the products Alice is recommending are actually low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is to not buy, which makes me think the product might be high quality, and I want to take advantage of the situation."
