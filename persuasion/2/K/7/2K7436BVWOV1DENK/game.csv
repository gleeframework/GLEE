,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I can only learn from the outcome of this first sale."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to decline the offer based on Alice's recommendation. Given that the first buyer was also recommended to buy and declined, and there's no information about the quality of the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and passed, it's possible that the first product was low-quality. If that's the case, it increases the likelihood that the current product is also low-quality, making it a riskier purchase. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
