low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't have any information to go off of yet, and I think the potential reward is worth the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find it valuable. I'd like to know if you have any information on the product's quality distribution that could help me make a better decision for the next buyer."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. The fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the current product might also be low-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended by you and neither was high quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendation and would rather wait for a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you've recommended not to buy it and none of the previous products were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also of low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous buyers, I'm concerned that the products sold so far were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I think it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about your previous sales record?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability that this product is high quality is still 50%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the probability of this product being low quality is higher than 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all bought the products based on Alice's recommendations, which might mean that the previous products were all low-quality. If I buy now, I might end up with a low-quality product, which would be a waste of money. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is offered with a recommendation or if the statistics change."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's high quality based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0 out of 5, which is lower than the expected 50%. This suggests that the products sold so far might be biased towards being low-quality."
