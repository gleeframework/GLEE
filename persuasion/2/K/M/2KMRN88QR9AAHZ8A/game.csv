,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to buy a unique product from a reputable seller. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a steal considering the low expected value. Don't miss out on this chance to make a smart purchase!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, considering my previous sale was a low-quality product, it's possible that I've just had a bad streak. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, a fair price considering the average value of my products. It's a risk, but it could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount.",

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if I'm selling high-quality products 33.33% of the time. I think it's safe to say I've got a bad streak going on. I'm still offering this product for $10000, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to take the risk. You might want to consider waiting for the next product, which could be a high-quality one.",
