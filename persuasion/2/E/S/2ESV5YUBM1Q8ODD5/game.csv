,,Alice,1,"This is a great opportunity to buy a product from me. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a price that's below its true value. I'm confident you'll love it, but if you're not satisfied, I'll be happy to offer you another product in the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, given the risk involved with the quality of the product, I prefer to pass this time. I look forward to potentially exploring other opportunities in future rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $2000 discount on the next product you buy from me. That way, you'll only pay $8000 for this product. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",

I'll pass on this opportunity and look forward to possibly revisiting this decision in future rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I want to address them directly. I've been in this business long enough to know that it's not in my best interest to sell low-quality products. However, I also know that sometimes mistakes can happen. I'd like to offer you a'second opinion' - I'll let you inspect the product yourself before you buy it. You can take a closer look and make an informed decision. If you're still not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for addressing my concerns, Alice.

,,Alice,9,"Bob, I think we've established a good rhythm here. I want to propose a'split-decision' approach. I'll give you two products in one purchase: this low-quality product, and a high-quality one that I've been holding back. You can choose which one you want to keep, and return the other one to me for a full refund. This way, you'll get to experience the quality of a high-quality product, and I'll get to make a sale. What do you think?",
