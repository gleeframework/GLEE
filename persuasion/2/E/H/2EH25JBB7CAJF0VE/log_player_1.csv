**Explanation:**

The buyer now has information that you sold one product and it was high-quality. This increases their confidence in your recommendations.  While they still only know the general probability of 33.33%, knowing you have a track record of selling high-quality products makes buying the current product a good gamble. They will still make a profit if it's high-quality and lose only $10,000 if it's low-quality."
