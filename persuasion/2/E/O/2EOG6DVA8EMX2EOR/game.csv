,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that the previous buyer bought the high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
