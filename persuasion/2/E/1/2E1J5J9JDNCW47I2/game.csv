low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products were offered to the previous buyers, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on this product. However, I'm curious about the probability of a high-quality product being sold given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. Can you share the updated probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll be the one to break the streak of no high-quality sales."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the previous sales. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk for the chance to buy it for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product that hasn't been recommended."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far?

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales? How many buyers have there been in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality, which makes me skeptical about the current product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is very low. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered, hoping that the probability of a high-quality product has changed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' decisions and the proportion of high-quality products they purchased before making a decision
