high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 so far, which is a very strong indication that the remaining products are also high-quality. Given the buyer in the previous round was willing to take a chance and buy at the standard price, and considering the high ratio of high-quality products, I'm willing to offer this product to you at a slight discount. I'll sell it to you for $9500. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.",

Although the ratio of high-quality products is impressive, it's still not a guarantee.
