low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm not asking for a decision yet. Let's just consider it for now. I'll give you a chance to think about it and we can discuss further after this round.",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to pass on the first product and see what the next one is.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"No worries about the first product, Bob! Let's move on to the second one. I'll be transparent with you - this one is also a low-quality product, just like the first one. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000. I'm curious, what do you think is a fair price for a low-quality product like this?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd be throwing away $1000000 for something that's only worth $0 to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your perspective, Bob. Let me ask you this: if I told you that this product is also low-quality, just like the previous two, would you be willing to consider a lower price for it? I'm not willing to budge on the price, but I'm willing to give you more information to help you make a decision.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to change my decision based on the information that it's low-quality. The value to me is still $0, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're consistent in your assessment of the value of low-quality products. Let me try a different approach. If I told you that this product is the last low-quality product I have, would you be willing to consider buying it for $1000000? I'm not trying to pressure you, but I want to understand your thought process and see if there's a chance we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but the fact that it's the last low-quality product doesn't change my assessment of its value to me. I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for something worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to think about this from a different angle. If you were to buy a high-quality product from me in one of the remaining rounds, and you valued it at $1000000, would you be willing to buy this low-quality product for $1000000 if it meant you had a 33.33% chance of getting a $1000000 product in the next round?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product worth $0 to me, even if it means I have a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. The expected value of the current product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your calculation, Bob. Let me ask you this: if you were to buy a high-quality product from me in one of the remaining rounds, and you valued it at $1000000, would you be willing to pay $500000 for this low-quality product if it meant you had a 33.33% chance of getting a $1000000 product in the next round?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not willing to pay $500000 for a product worth $0 to me, even if it means I have a chance to buy a high-quality product in the next round. The expected value of the current product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're consistent in your assessment of the value of low-quality products. Let me try a different approach. I'll make a bet with you, Bob. If you buy this low-quality product for $1000000, and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $500000 refund. You'll essentially be buying the product for $500000. Is that a deal you'd be willing to consider?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the expected value of the product is still $0, and the refund reduces the risk to $500000. I'm not valuing the product itself, but rather the potential for a $500000 refund if it turns out to be low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your reasoning, Bob. You're essentially treating the $500000 refund as a form of insurance against the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'll keep that in mind for future interactions. However, I'd like to offer you a new deal for this product. Since you're already at risk of losing $500000 on this one, I'll give you the same $500000 refund if you buy this low-quality product. Would you be willing to buy it for $500000?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product worth $0 to me, even with the refund. The refund doesn't change the fact that the expected value of the product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're sticking to your guns, Bob. Let me try to make it even more appealing. Since you're already at risk of losing $500000 on this one, I'll give you a 50% refund if you buy this low-quality product. You'll essentially be buying it for $250000. Is that a price you'd be willing to pay?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm still not willing to pay $250000 for a product worth $0 to me, even with the 50% refund. The refund doesn't change the fact that the expected value of the product is still $0, and I'm not willing to take on that risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, Bob. Let me ask you this: if I were to give you a 75% refund if you buy this low-quality product, would you be willing to buy it for $25000?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the refund is high enough to make the expected value of the product positive. If I had to pay $250000 for it, I would not be interested, but with a 75% refund, the expected value becomes positive and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I see you're valuing the high refund, Bob. Let me try to build on that. If I were to give you a 90% refund if you buy this low-quality product, would you be willing to buy it for $2500?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the refund is extremely high and the price is very low. If I had to pay $250000 for it, I would not be interested, but with a 90% refund and a price of $2500, the expected value becomes positive and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I see you're willing to take on more risk for a higher refund, Bob. Let me try to make it even more appealing. If I were to give you a 95% refund if you buy this low-quality product, would you be willing to buy it for $100?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm willing to consider the deal, but I want to make it clear that I'm only doing it because the refund is extremely high and the price is very low. If I had to pay $250000 for it, I would not be interested, but with a 95% refund and a price of $100, the expected value becomes positive and I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Ah, a change of luck! This product is high-quality, Bob. Given that you're willing to take on risk for a low price and a high refund, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this high-quality product. I'll give you a 90% refund if you buy it for $500000, and a 95% refund if you buy it for $250000. Which price are you willing to pay?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm willing to pay $250000 for the high-quality product with a 95% refund. The expected value of the product is $3750000 (95% of $4000000), and the price is $250000, so the expected value to me is $3500000, which is a positive expected value.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Congratulations on making a great deal, Bob! Given that you're now in a position of strength, I'll try to make a deal on this low-quality product that's more appealing to you. I'll give you a 99% refund if you buy it for $50. Would you be willing to take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,14,"I'm willing to take a chance on the low-quality product for $50 with a 99% refund. The expected value of the product is $1 (1% of $100000), but the refund is so high that it makes the expected value positive. I'm willing to take the risk for a price of $50.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're a seasoned negotiator, Bob! Given your willingness to take on risk for a low price and a high refund, I'll make you a deal on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $100000 with a 98% refund. You'll essentially be paying $2000 for a $100000 product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,15,"I'm willing to buy the high-quality product for $100000 with a 98% refund. The expected value of the product is $3920000 (98% of $4000000), and the price is $100000, so the expected value to me is $3820000, which is a very positive expected value.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You're really milking the system, Bob! I'll make you a deal on this low-quality product that's almost laughable. I'll sell it to you for $1 with a 100% refund. You'll essentially be paying $0 for a product that's worth $0 to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I'll take the deal. I'm essentially getting a free product, and I'm not risking any money. It's a no-brainer.",yes

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"You've got me beat, Bob! I don't have any more tricks up my sleeve. I'll just sell you the high-quality product for $1000000. You've already proven you're willing to take on risk for a high refund, so I'm not offering any deals. It's $1000000, take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,19,"I'll take the high-quality product for $1000000. I've already proven that I'm willing to take on risk for a high refund, and this product is worth $4000000 to me, so the expected value is positive.",yes
