high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"You are about to buy a high-quality product for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I have sold 0 low-quality products. This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a price that is likely to be below its true value.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to make an informed decision.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and now I'm offering a new product. Since you don't know the quality of this product, you should consider the fact that the first product I sold was high-quality. It's possible that I'm just selling the low-quality products later on. I'm selling this product for $10000, which is the same price as the previous one. You might want to think about whether you're willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at this price.",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced that the first product being high-quality means the next one will also be high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if more information becomes available before making a decision.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products, and 1 low-quality product. This means that 2 out of 3 products I've sold so far are high-quality. I'm selling this product for $10000, the same price as the previous ones. You might want to consider that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 2/3, which is higher than the initial 50%. Is $10000 a fair price for a product that has a 2/3 chance of being high-quality?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, considering the updated probability of it being high-quality is 2/3, which is higher than the initial 50%. I'm willing to pay $10000 for a 2/3 chance of getting a high-quality product worth $30000.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products, and 1 low-quality product. This means that 3 out of 4 products I've sold so far are high-quality. I'm selling this product for $10000, the same price as the previous ones. You might want to consider that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 3/4, which is even higher than before. I'm also willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll sell you the next product at a 20% discount. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and buy the product?",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to take advantage of the offer and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk given the high-quality rate of 3/4 and the guarantee.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products, and 2 low-quality products. This means that 4 out of 6 products I've sold so far are high-quality, which is still a high ratio. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've broken my guarantee from the previous round. I'm now selling a low-quality product for $10000, the same price as the previous ones. I'm willing to offer you a chance to ask me any question you'd like about my sales record or the product before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to ask a question. Can you tell me the total number of products you have in stock, and how many products you have left after selling 6 so far?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I have a total of 14 products in stock, and I've sold 6 so far. This means I have 8 products left. I'm selling this product for $10000. Considering my sales record, it's possible that I've sold the high-quality products early on and now I'm left with a batch of low-quality ones. You might want to think about whether you're willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at this price.",
,,the buyer,6,I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at this price. I'd like to wait and observe more sales to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold continues to decrease.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've now sold 5 high-quality products, and 3 low-quality products. This means that 5 out of 9 products I've sold so far are high-quality, which is still a high ratio. I'm selling this product for $10000. You might want to consider that I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, which suggests that I might be selling the high-quality products in batches. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to buy a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to take advantage of the opportunity to buy a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I'll take a calculated risk and buy the product, hoping that it's another high-quality one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've now sold 6 high-quality products, and 4 low-quality products. This means that 6 out of 13 products I've sold so far are high-quality, which is still a relatively high ratio. However, I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row after selling a low-quality one, which suggests that I might be selling the high-quality products in batches. I'm selling this product for $10000. You might want to consider that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the pattern of sales suggests that I might be running low on high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy the product?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, considering the pattern of sales. However, I'm also aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and I'm not sure if the pattern is just a coincidence. I'd like to know the quality of the product after making my decision.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products, and 4 low-quality products. This means that 7 out of 14 products I've sold so far are high-quality. I'm selling this product for $10000. I want to remind you that you asked to know the quality of the product after making your decision in the previous round, and I'm willing to do the same for you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately. Would you like to take the chance and buy the product?",
,,the buyer,9,I'd like to pass on this product and wait for more information. I'm not convinced that the 7 out of 14 high-quality products is a reliable indicator of the overall quality of the products.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've now sold 7 high-quality products, and 5 low-quality products. This means that 7 out of 15 products I've sold so far are high-quality. I want to highlight that the ratio of high-quality products is still relatively high, but it's also possible that I've simply sold the high-quality products early on. I'm selling this product for $10000. You might want to consider that I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which could indicate that I'm running low on high-quality products. Would you like to take a chance and buy the product?",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, considering the high initial ratio of high-quality products and the possibility that you're running low on high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I think the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is worth it.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've now sold 8 high-quality products, and 6 low-quality products. This means that 8 out of 16 products I've sold so far are high-quality. I want to remind you that you took a chance and bought the previous product, and it was indeed low-quality. However, this product is high-quality. I'm selling this product for $10000. You might want to consider that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which suggests that I still have a steady supply of high-quality products. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to buy a high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given that you've sold 8 high-quality products out of 16, I'm inclined to take another chance. Since I've already bought one low-quality product, I'm hoping that this one will be high-quality. I'll take the product.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've now sold 9 high-quality products, and 6 low-quality products. This means that 9 out of 17 products I've sold so far are high-quality. I want to remind you that you've taken two chances and bought two low-quality products, but I've also sold two high-quality products in a row. I'm selling this product for $10000. You might want to consider that I've now sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which suggests that I'm consistently selling high-quality products. However, I want to be transparent with you: I'm running low on low-quality products, and I'm getting close to selling out. Would you like to take the last chance to buy a high-quality product before I run out?",
