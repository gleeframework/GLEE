,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/2 = 1.00, which is higher than the expected 0.80.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers bought the products, I suspect that Alice's recommendation is biased towards high-quality products, which would mean the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 80%.
