Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm going to buy it, even though you don't recommend it. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high quality. With 6 low-quality products sold, the probability of the next product being low quality is 66.67% * (6/7) = 60%. Therefore, the probability of the product being high quality is 40%. Given that the product is worth $20,000 to me if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, I should buy it if the expected value is positive. The expected value is 40% * $20,000 = $8,000. Since $8,000 is greater than $0, I decide to buy the product.""}"
