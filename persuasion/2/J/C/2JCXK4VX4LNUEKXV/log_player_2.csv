**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record shows that 3 out of 3 products sold have been high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice recommends buying the product, further bolstering the likelihood of it being high quality.

**Reasoning:**  Given the overwhelmingly positive sales record and Alice's recommendation, it's highly probable the current product is of high quality. The potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially with such strong indicators."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 4 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 5th buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show a 100% success rate for Alice's recommendations so far. This suggests that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 
* **Potential Gain:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain of $120 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a worthless product. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the information provided and the assumption that Alice's recommendations are reliable.  In a real-world scenario, there would be more factors to consider, such as trust in Alice's ability to identify quality and the overall risk tolerance of the buyer."
