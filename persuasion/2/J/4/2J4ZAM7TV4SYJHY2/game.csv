high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm offering you a 50% discount, which brings the price down to $500000. If you buy this product, I'll also throw in a free inspection report that proves its quality, which will increase its value even further. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by the discount and the inspection report. I'll pass on this round.,no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm not surprised you were skeptical about the discount and inspection report. Let me try a different approach. I'll be completely transparent with you: I'm offering you a product that I've already established has a 80% chance of being high-quality. Given the uncertainty, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's 20% of the original $1000000, which is $200000. This way, you'll be getting a potentially high-quality product at a significantly discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm willing to take the 20% discount and buy the product at $200000. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!,yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Congratulations on making a great purchase! You've got a potentially high-quality product for a steal at $200000. Now, let's talk about the next one. I want to offer you a 'guarantee' of sorts. If you buy this next product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the purchase price, plus an additional $50000. That way, you'll have nothing to lose. I'll sell it to you for the full $1000000, but you'll have the security of knowing you can get your money back if it's not what you're looking for. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the 'guarantee'. I'd rather not take the risk of losing $50000, even if I do get a full refund. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the guarantee, and I respect your caution. Let me try a different approach. Since you've already bought one high-quality product from me, I'm willing to offer you a 'premium' product that's even better than the one you purchased earlier. This one has an 80% chance of being high-quality, just like the last one, but it's also been thoroughly inspected and certified by a third-party expert. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which is $100000 less than the original price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm interested in the premium product with the third-party inspection and certification. The price of $900000 seems reasonable, so I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're interested in the premium product! Now, let's talk about the next one. I want to offer you a 'comparison' deal. I'll give you a chance to compare this product to the one you just bought. If you buy this one and it turns out to be high-quality, you'll get to keep both products. If it's low-quality, you'll only have to return this one and keep the premium product you just bought. I'll sell it to you for $800000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I like the comparison deal! If I buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll get two high-quality products. If it's low-quality, I'll only lose the low-quality product. The price of $800000 seems reasonable, so I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a savvy buyer! I like your logic. Now, let's take it a step further. I'll offer you a 'bundle deal'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase. That means you'll get the next product for 90% of the original price. If it's low-quality, you'll just have to deal with it. I'll sell it to you for $700000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I like the bundle deal! A 10% discount on the next purchase is a great incentive. The price of $700000 seems reasonable, so I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're really taking advantage of the bundle deal! Now, let's make it even sweeter. Since you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a 'consistency discount'. I'll give you a 15% discount on the next purchase, and you'll also get to keep the 10% discount from the bundle deal. That means you'll get the next product for 85% of the original price. I'll sell it to you for $850000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Wow, the consistency discount is amazing! With the 15% discount and the bundle deal's 10% discount, I'll get the next product for 85% of the original price. That's a great deal! I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with the consistency discount! However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product. I've checked the quality and it's actually a low-quality product. I know you're not getting the 85% discount on this one, but I want to make it right. I'll give you a special 'bad deal' price of $600000, which is 40% off the original price. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this round.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I completely understand your decision on the low-quality product. Let's move on to the next one. Since you've been doing well with the high-quality products, I'll offer you a'rebound deal'. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $950000, which is a slight premium over the previous price. However, I'll also throw in a'rebound bonus' - if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get an additional 5% discount on your next purchase. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take the rebound deal. The premium price of $950000 is still a good value, and the rebound bonus is a nice incentive. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes

I'll sell this product to you for $900000. What do you think?",
