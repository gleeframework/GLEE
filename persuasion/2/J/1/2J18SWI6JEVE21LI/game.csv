,,Alice,1,"Welcome! This is the first product I'm selling. I don't have any prior sales history, but I assure you that I'll be transparent throughout our interaction. I'm offering this product for $10000. Consider the overall probability that the product might be high-quality (33.33%) or low-quality (66.67%). Make your decision based on this information.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold one product so far, and I'm offering this new one for $10000. Keep in mind the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. I'll let my sales history speak for itself as it grows.",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk given the low sales history.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far. Consider that the overall probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. One of my previous buyers was lucky, but the odds remain the same for this new product, which I'm offering for $10000.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, and I'm offering this new one for $10000. Remember that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Out of my previous sales, 1 was high-quality. Make your decision based on these statistics.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. The odds of this product being high-quality are still 33.33%. I'm offering it for $10000. Consider my sales history and the overall probability when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're trying to get rid of the high-quality product as quickly as possible, and I'm hoping to get lucky. I'm not basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is still 33.33%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. Some buyers have mentioned trying to get lucky or thinking I'm trying to get rid of high-quality products quickly. I assure you, I'm just selling products as they come. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Make your decision based on this information. The price is $10000.",
,,the buyer,6,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that the probability of it being high-quality is actually 33.33% given the previous sales record. The fact that only 1 out of 5 products sold was high-quality makes me think that the true probability might be lower.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. The previous buyer was skeptical about the true probability, but I assure you that the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality is accurate. However, I understand the concern. My sales history might not reflect the true probability yet, given the small sample size. Keep this in mind when deciding whether to buy this product for $10000.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm trying to learn more about the true probability of a high-quality product. I'm hoping that my purchase will help to provide more data points for future buyers.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. Some buyers have expressed skepticism about the true probability, and I appreciate their willingness to provide more data points. However, I must remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Don't rely solely on my sales history, as it's still a relatively small sample size. Make your decision based on this information, and consider the price of $10000.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm hoping to get lucky and get a good deal.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. I want to be transparent with you - the trend of low-quality products continues, but the probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. Don't be discouraged by my recent sales history, as each product is independent. Make your decision based on this information, and consider the price of $10000.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward of $12000.",yes

Make your decision based on this information, and consider the price of $10000.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
