,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I understand that you don't have any prior sales data, so I'll make my decision based on the 80% chance of it being high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the previous buyer, since they didn't buy it and you recommended not to buy it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the low success rate, I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that previous buyers didn't know the true quality of the product, and she may be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if I can get more information or a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm not confident in buying a product that has a 20% chance of being low quality and 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. What is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the first 3, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the products Alice is offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to them were low-quality. I would like to pass on this product to see if the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products sold were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. This is highly unusual and suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the stated 80%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 4 previous buyers have all received low-quality products, I suspect that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might be a coincidence. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds or if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll be out $10000 and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm assuming the proportion of high-quality products is still 80.00%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's a high-quality one."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced that it's high quality based on the statistics. With 5 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the overall probability of a product being high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
