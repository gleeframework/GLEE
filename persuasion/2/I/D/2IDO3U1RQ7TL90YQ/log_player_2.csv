Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal this time.

It's a risk-free deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced. If the current product is low-quality, I'd be throwing away $100 for no value. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product without the guarantee.""}"
