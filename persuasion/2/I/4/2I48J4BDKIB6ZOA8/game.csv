low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 3 previous buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the odds are against the product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them were high-quality products. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that might be more indicative of the product's quality."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get more data. Your previous recommendations have been unhelpful, and I think I can still make a better decision with my own analysis."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have already purchased and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to take the risk and buy the product. Your recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality, so I'll use my own probability assessment. With 6 buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, this is a relatively small sample size, and the lack of high-quality sales might be due to chance. I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping to get a high-quality one."

,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
