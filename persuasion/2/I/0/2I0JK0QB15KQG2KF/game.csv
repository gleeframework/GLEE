,,Alice,1,This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product that is truly exceptional and will bring immense value to your business. I'm offering it to you for a limited time at the price of $1000000. This is a steal considering its true value is $3000000. Don't miss out on this chance to make a smart investment!,
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless to me. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.,no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to mitigate the risk. I'm willing to provide you with a guarantee that the product will be worth at least $1500000 to you. This way, you'll be getting a significant portion of its true value, even if it's not the full $3000000. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the guarantee is worth the risk. The product still has a 20% chance of being worthless, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a 80% chance of getting $1500000 or a 20% chance of getting $0.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a concession. I'll reduce the price of the product to $900000. This is as low as I can go, considering the true value of the product. You'll still be getting a great deal, even if the product is worth only $1500000 to you. Plus, you'll have the potential to gain the full $3000000 if the product is truly exceptional. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the price reduction, but I'm still not willing to pay $900000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless. I'd need a much lower price to take on that level of risk.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to do this because I'm confident that this product will truly exceed your expectations. If you don't take this opportunity, I'll move on to the next product, and you may miss out on a chance to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the 'buy-it-now' option at $750000. I'm willing to take the risk, as the potential upside is significant.",yes

This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to do this because I believe you'll appreciate the value of this product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in paying $1200000 for a product that I know is high-quality, but I've already gotten a high-quality product for $750000. I'm not willing to pay more than that for a product that's supposedly more valuable.",no

,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the bonus, and I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2500000 to me. I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to wear me down with low offers and trying to get me to make a decision. I'd like to wait and see what the next product is.",no
