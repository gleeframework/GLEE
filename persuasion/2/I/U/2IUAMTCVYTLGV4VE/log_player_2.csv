Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I respect your cautious approach. Let me put your mind at ease. I'll share a unique insight with you. Out of the 20 products I have, 16 are high-quality, like the one I'm offering you now. That means the chances of getting a high-quality product are extremely high.
