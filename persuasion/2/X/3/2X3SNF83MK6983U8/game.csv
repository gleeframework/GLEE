,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000, a steal at twice its worth. It's a rare opportunity to get a premium product at a fraction of its true value. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say?",

What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, even if I get to inspect it for a short time. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on its quality after it's revealed to me.",no

I'll give you $5000 for it, which is more than its actual value. It's a generous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the risk you took on the previous product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm not interested in buying a product worth nothing to me, even for $5000. I'll pass on this one.",no
