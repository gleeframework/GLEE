Since you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a discount of $200000 off the original price. That brings the price down to $800000.

Now, I know what you're thinking - why would I want to buy a low-quality product? Well, let me tell you, these products may not be top-of-the-line, but they're still worth something to the right buyer. And at $1000000, it's a steal! You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I guarantee it. Plus, I'll throw in a special bonus - I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you buy this low-quality product. What do you say, Bob? Are you ready to take a chance on a low-quality product?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the transparency, Alice, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price.

However, I want to emphasize that the probability of that happening is very low, given the reputable source I acquired it from. But, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to mitigate that risk.
