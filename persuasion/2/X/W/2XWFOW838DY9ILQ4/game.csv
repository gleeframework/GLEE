high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to negotiate the price for the next product, but this one is a steal at this price. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. If you buy this product, I'll give you a unique identifier that will give you priority access to future high-quality products at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only paying the listed price of $1000000. I'm not interested in any promises of future discounts or priority access.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a straight shooter, Bob! I'll respect that. For this next product, I'll be transparent with you. I have a 20% chance of offering a low-quality product, which is essentially worthless to you. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000, the same price as last time. However, I'm willing to offer you a'safety valve' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. This way, you can minimize your risk and still get a great deal on a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in the safety valve offer. I'd rather take my chances and potentially save $250000. I'll pass on this product.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Fair enough, Bob! You're a savvy negotiator. Alright, let's try a different approach. Since you're willing to take the risk, I'll offer you a price that reflects the uncertainty. I'll give you a 20% discount on the list price, which brings the price down to $800000. This way, you're getting a high-quality product at a lower price, and you're still taking on the risk of it being a low-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product at the discounted price of $800000. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're on a roll, Bob! You're 2 for 2. For this next product, I'll offer you a price that's even more aggressive. Since you're taking on the risk, I'll give you an 80% discount on the list price, which brings the price down to $200000. This is a steal, even if it's a low-quality product. But I'm confident that it's a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take a significant loss to get it to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not falling for that. An 80% discount is too good to be true, and I'm not willing to take on that kind of risk. I'll pass on this product.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your caution, Bob. Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You've already bought two high-quality products at a discount, and you've been offered a third at an even deeper discount. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price that's more in line with the market value, but still a discount from the list price. I'll give you a 20% discount, which brings the price down to $1000000. This is a fair price for a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take the product at the discounted price of $1000000. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're 3 for 3, Bob! I'm impressed. Since you're on a hot streak, I'll give you a special offer. I'll give you the option to buy this product at the same price you bought the previous one, $1000000. However, I'll also give you a 'buy-it-now' option for $1250000, which is the list price. If you choose to buy at the list price, you'll get a unique guarantee: if this product turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice, free of charge. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the 'buy-it-now' option at $1250000, especially with the condition of getting a second product if this one is low-quality. I'll stick with the original price of $1000000.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Fair enough, Bob. You're a shrewd negotiator. Let's try a different approach. Since you're familiar with the price of $1000000, I'll offer you a 'price match' guarantee. If you buy this product at $1000000, and you're not satisfied with it, I'll refund the full amount and give you a second high-quality product of your choice, free of charge. This way, you're protected, and you can still get a great deal on a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in the price match guarantee. I'm already aware of the risk of buying a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a'maybe' high-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no

You can make an offer on the product, and I'll consider it. If your offer is accepted, you'll get the product at the price you specified. If not, I'll give you a chance to buy it at the list price. You can't lose, and you might get a great deal. What's your best offer?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in making an offer. I'll just stick with the list price of $1000000. If I make an offer and it's rejected, I'll be giving up the chance to buy the product at the list price, which is still a good deal for me.",no

However, I'll throw in a unique bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you access to a special 'VIP' list, which will give you exclusive access to high-quality products at unbeatable prices. This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in the VIP list or the bonus. I'm already getting a good deal on the product, and I'm not willing to overpay just for some extra perks.",no

,,Alice,12,"I respect your priorities, Bob. You're a straight shooter. Let's focus on the product. I'll give you a simple offer: the product for $950000, no frills, no extras. This is the price, and it's a fair one. If you're happy with the product, I'm happy to sell it to you. What do you say?",
