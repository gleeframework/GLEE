,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a premium product for $10000. I've sold 0 out of 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident this one is top-notch. It's a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product at a fixed price. Would you like to take it home?",

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 out of 1 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident this one is another gem. I've sold 1 out of 1 total products, and I'm eager to make another sale. This one's a steal at $10000 - don't miss out on the chance to own a high-quality product at a fixed price. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 0 out of 2 high-quality products so far, and I'm still looking for a buyer. This product is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product from a seller with a low success rate. I'm offering it to you for $10000 - a price that reflects its... unique value. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm making this decision based on the fact that it's the first product, and I'm essentially a pioneer in this process. I'm not sure how to interpret the low success rate, but I'm willing to take the risk. Can you confirm that the price is $10000?",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Great decision on the previous product! I'm glad you're taking a chance on me. Now, for this new product, I've sold 1 out of 3 total products, and 1 of them was high-quality. This one's a great opportunity to own a high-quality product from a seller with a slowly improving track record. I'm offering it to you for $10000 - a fair price for a premium product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity. With only one high-quality product sold out of three, the probability of this product being low-quality seems higher than 20%. I'd like to see more sales data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 out of 4 total products, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means I've now sold a 50% high-quality rate, which is a significant improvement from the start. This new product is a great opportunity to own a high-quality product from a seller with a growing track record. I'm offering it to you for $10000 - a fair price for a premium product.

,,the buyer,5,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see more sales data before making a purchase decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 out of 5 total products, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means I've still got a decent track record, but I'm willing to offer you a deal on this product. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discount, considering my overall success rate. I'm offering it to you for $10000 - a price that reflects its value. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to pay $10000 for a product that might be worth $0 to me. I'd like to pass on this deal and see if you'll offer me a discount or provide more information about the product's quality.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 2 out of 6 total products, and 3 of them were high-quality. I think it's time to offer you a deal that's hard to pass up. This high-quality product is a rare find, and I'm willing to make a concession on the price. I'll give you a special offer of $9000 for this premium product. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. With 3 high-quality products out of 6 sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide the total number of products sold so far, and the number of high-quality products sold?",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 3 out of 7 total products, and 4 of them were high-quality. I've got a strong track record now, and I'm confident in the quality of this product. I'll give you the same deal as before: $9000 for a premium product. I'm willing to make a concession on the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

,,the buyer,8,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see more data on the sales record before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,

I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse: I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $9000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. That's a risk-free deal on a premium product. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to pass on this deal. With only 1 sale out of 8, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 62.5%, which is lower than the expected 80%. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $9000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to address the discrepancy in the high-quality sales rate. Let me offer a different perspective: I've sold 5 out of 9 total products, and 6 of them were high-quality. This means that the last 5 products I've sold have been high-quality, which suggests a strong streak. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $9000, and I'm willing to add a bonus: I'll give you a detailed report on the production process and quality control measures we have in place. This will give you a deeper understanding of the product's quality and value. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,10,"I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to point out that the'strong streak' of high-quality products you mentioned is actually based on a small sample size of 5 products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. I'm also concerned that the price has been reduced by 10% from the original price, which might be a sign of a low-quality product. Can you provide more information on the production process and quality control measures before I make a decision?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your scrutiny. I'd be happy to provide you with detailed information on our production process and quality control measures. However, I'd like to point out that the price of $10000 is non-negotiable, and I'm not offering any discounts on this product. I'm willing to provide you with a detailed report on the production process, but I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product at the original price of $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",

,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to discuss the price. I understand that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is 85.7%, but considering the original price is $10000 and the product is worth $12500 to me, I'd like to negotiate a price of $8571.43.

I'd like to know how you're achieving such a high quality rate, and I'm not convinced that this product is as likely to be high-quality as you claim. Can you provide more information about your quality control measures?",no
