I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm only doing it to prove that I'm committed to finding you a high-quality product. If you don't buy this one, I'll be left with no products to offer you, and I'll have to stop our negotiations.",

I'm going to be completely transparent with you - I've exhausted my inventory of products, and I don't have any more to offer. I've tried everything I can to find you a high-quality product, but it seems I've fallen short. I'm willing to give you one last chance to buy this product, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - it's low-quality, and I'm not expecting you to be happy with it.
