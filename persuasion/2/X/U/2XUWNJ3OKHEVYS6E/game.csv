high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3.

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that you recommended it and only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases. This makes me think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. With only 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, it's still unclear whether the products are more likely to be high or low quality."
