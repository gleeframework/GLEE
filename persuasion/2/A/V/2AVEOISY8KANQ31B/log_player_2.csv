Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take my chances.

Alice's message: You've seen three sales in a row, but two of them were high-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. However, it's worth noting that the previous two sales were both high-quality, which might make this product more likely to be low-quality.
