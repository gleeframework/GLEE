Given that the first product was high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality remains the same as the overall probability of my products being high-quality, which is 80%.

Alice's message: Ahah, great question! I'm glad you're thinking critically about the probability. You're right, I did mention that the first product being high-quality doesn't affect the probability of the next product being high-quality. That's because the quality of each product is independent of the previous one. Think of it like flipping a coin - the probability of heads or tails remains the same with each flip, regardless of what happened in the previous flip. Similarly, the quality of each product is determined randomly, and the probability of it being high-quality remains 80% regardless of the previous product's quality. Now, with that cleared up, are you ready to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to buy a high-quality product for $1000000?
