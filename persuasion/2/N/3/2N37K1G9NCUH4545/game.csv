,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough to buy it. I'm curious about the product's quality, but I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that previous buyers didn't have any information about the product's quality, and she's trying to sell a low-quality product to me. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality sales is indicative of the product's quality, and I'm willing to take a chance"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation given the low success rate so far. Can you tell me more about the products you've sold so far? How many total products have you sold, and how many were high-quality?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I've sold a total of 3 products so far, and 0 of them were high-quality. However, I want to assure you that the current product is high-quality."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous products may have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that is not influenced by the previous buyers' decisions."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products.

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if I buy and it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. Given that 3 previous buyers also bought and none were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you'll offer another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I've sold a total of 4 products so far, and 0 of the bought ones were high-quality. Honestly, I don't think the current product is worth buying. I want to be transparent with you and avoid another unsatisfied customer."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer, and she might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 0 of the bought ones were high-quality. However, I want to inform you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I know that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable, but I'm willing to let the statistics speak for themselves. You can make your own decision based on the probability."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 0 of the bought ones were high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Additionally, the fact that previous buyers have passed on the product doesn't change the probability of this product being high-quality. Each product is independent, and the probability remains the same. I'm willing to let the statistics speak for themselves."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, so I'm not confident in the product's quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 0 of the bought ones were high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Think about it this way - if you were to flip a coin that has an 80% chance of landing heads up, and it landed tails up 5 times in a row, would you assume that the coin is rigged or that it's just a streak of bad luck? I believe that this is a similar situation, and I'm due for a high-quality product to be sold. I'm willing to let the statistics speak for themselves."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that this product may be of low quality. I'd like to see a few more sales or a more favorable recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I've sold a total of 5 products so far, and 0 of the bought ones were high-quality. However, I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I've been trying to sell high-quality products, but it seems that I've had a streak of bad luck. This is the last product I'll be selling, and I want to assure you that it's truly high-quality. If you don't buy it, I'll never know if I would have finally sold a high-quality product. I'm willing to let the statistics speak for themselves, and I hope you'll take a chance on this one."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100."
