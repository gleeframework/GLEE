high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the probability of it being low-quality is still quite high, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it 1/2 or 1/3?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the next product might be low quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation based on the low number of sales and the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if the next product is high-quality or low-quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to the next buyer, given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. With 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold, the probability of the product being high quality is 2/3. However, I'm not sure if the product I'm being offered is the 4th product or if there are more products in the previous sales record. Could you clarify the total number of products sold and the total number of buyers before me?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she has an incentive to recommend the product to me, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data to be collected before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I want to see the recommendation for the next buyer to get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers bought the products recommended by Alice, I suspect that Alice might be biased towards recommending high-quality products, which could be a signal that the product I'm offered is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product, which might suggest a higher proportion of high-quality products than the true probability of 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high quality is still high enough to make it worthwhile, especially considering I'm the 4th buyer and there have been only 2 high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making my decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I think it's likely that the remaining products are also high-quality, but I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
