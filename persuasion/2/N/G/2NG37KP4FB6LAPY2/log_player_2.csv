"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.

You'll be one of the first to get a taste of what's to come, and I think you'll be impressed.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying into your sales pitch again. I just lost $10,000 on the last product, and I'm not willing to take another risk. I'll pass on this one.""}"
