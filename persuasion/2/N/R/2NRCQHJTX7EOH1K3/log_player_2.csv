"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000.

Now that you've had a chance to see what a low-quality product looks like, I'd like to offer you a more compelling reason to buy this high-quality product. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed report on its specifications and features, which I think you'll find very valuable. This report is normally worth $2000, but I'll include it with the purchase of this product. What do you think?

Since you've seen two low-quality products in a row, I'll offer you a 'insurance' policy. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $5000. This way, you'll only lose $5000, instead of the full $10000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying this product because of the insurance policy. If it's low-quality, I'll take the refund and try to get a better deal in the next round.""}"

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount, making it $8000, and I'll also throw in a free product in a future round. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll also give you a 'priority pass' for the next three rounds.
