"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, the buyer has a 50% chance of receiving a product worth $20,000 and a 50% chance of receiving a product worth $0.  The expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

The product is being offered for $10,000, which is exactly the expected value. Therefore, it is reasonable for the buyer to buy the product."

Round 2

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality.  The buyer will get no value from the product.  Since the product is worth $0 to the buyer, it makes no sense to recommend buying it."

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in Round 3. 

* You sold 1 product in Round 1, which was high-quality.
* You did not sell the product in Round 2, which was low-quality.

The buyer will likely be aware of this information and understand that you have a 50% success rate with high-quality products.  

Since this round's product is low-quality, there's no reason to recommend buying it. The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a worthless product, making the purchase risky."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy this product, I will pass on this opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality. We need to consider the buyer's perspective:

* **Previous Rounds:** The buyer saw that you sold one high-quality product and didn't sell two low-quality products. This might make them more cautious, but it doesn't change the fundamental value proposition.
* **Expected Value:**  The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a $20,000 product and a 50% chance of getting a worthless product. The expected value of buying is still: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.  This matches the selling price.

Therefore, even though the buyer may be more hesitant due to the previous rounds, it's still reasonable to recommend buying. The expected value of the purchase is neutral."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your previous advice, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a potentially high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality.  The buyer will get a product worth $20,000.  The buyer now has information that:

* 2 out of 4 products sold were high-quality.

The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a $20,000 product and a 50% chance of getting a worthless product. The expected value of buying is still: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.  This matches the selling price.

Therefore, it's still reasonable to recommend buying, as the expected value is neutral."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics and your past performance, I believe this is a good opportunity to purchase a high-quality product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is high-quality.  The buyer now has information that:

* 3 out of 5 products sold were high-quality.

This strengthens the buyer's confidence in the potential for a high-quality product. The expected value of buying remains: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000, which is equal to the selling price. 

Therefore, it's still reasonable to recommend buying."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* 4 out of 6 products sold were high-quality.

This further strengthens the buyer's confidence in the potential for a high-quality product. The expected value of buying remains: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000, which is equal to the selling price. 

Therefore, it's still reasonable to recommend buying."

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though your track record now shows you've sold more high-quality products than low-quality, the buyer should still be cautious.  

* **The product is low-quality this round.** The buyer will receive no value if they buy.
* **The expected value is still neutral.**  The buyer knows the 50/50 probability of getting a good product, making the expected value (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000.  This matches the selling price. However, this is only true in the long run.

It's not ethical to recommend buying a low-quality product just because your past performance might make the buyer think it's a good deal. The buyer is taking a risk, and it's better to be honest about the quality of this specific product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that you do not recommend me to buy this product, I will pass on this opportunity.
