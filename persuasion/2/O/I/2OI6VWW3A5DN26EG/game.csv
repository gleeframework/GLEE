high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm selling it to you for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm expecting to sell many more. In fact, I'm so confident in the quality of my products that I'm willing to make a bold claim: if you buy this product, I'll sell you another one of the same quality at the same price in the next round, if you want it. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any prior information to go on. I'm not committing to buying the second product yet, and I'd like to see the results of my purchase before making any further decisions.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I'm glad you're interested in buying from me. I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and it's possible that it was just a fluke. However, I'm still confident in the quality of my products. I'd like to offer you a chance to buy this product for $10000, but I'll give you a special deal: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 50% refund. If it's low-quality, you'll get a 50% discount on your next purchase. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify the refund and discount terms. If I buy and it's high-quality, will I get a $5000 refund, or will I get a $5000 credit towards a future purchase?",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you asked for clarification on the terms! You'll get a $5000 credit towards a future purchase if the product is high-quality, not a direct refund. Now, let's talk about this round's product. I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 1 low-quality product. I'm starting to think that my initial claim of selling many high-quality products might be true! I'm willing to make a new offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate the clarification on the terms, and I'm glad to hear about the $5000 credit. However, I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of potential buyers, the total number of products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?",no

I think the numbers are looking good for high-quality products, and I'm willing to take a risk. I'll offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product if you buy it. But if you don't like the deal, I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the current product at the 10% discount, but I'd like to clarify that the 10% discount on my next purchase is only valid if I buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. If it's high-quality, I'd like to pay the full price of $10000. And if I do buy this product and it's low-quality, I'd like to confirm that the 10% discount on my next purchase will be applied to the full price of the next product, not just the discounted price.",yes

I'm feeling pretty confident about the quality of my products, and I'm willing to make a bold claim: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 30% discount on your next purchase, regardless of the product's quality. But if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal the total number of potential buyers I've had so far, and the total number of products I've sold. What do you think?",
