,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd rather wait for the next round to get a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy this one. I've already missed out on a high-quality product, so I'd like to try my luck again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one. Alice's recommendation was to not buy, so I'll trust her judgment and not take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy this one. I've already passed on a low-quality product, and I'm due for a high-quality one, so I'll go with Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I've bought two high-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think Alice might be trying to sell me all the good ones first. I'll pass on this one and see if I can catch any low-quality ones."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,I'm not going to let a streak of consecutive high-quality products make me paranoid. I'll trust Alice's judgment and buy this one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,I should have known better! I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product. I'm going to be more cautious from now on and pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to take advantage of Alice's lack of recommendation and buy this one. She's not recommending it, so it's probably low-quality, and I can get it for a good price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Déjà vu! I'm getting a pattern here. Alice's lack of recommendation seems to be a reliable indicator of a low-quality product. I'll take the risk and buy this one, hoping to get it for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not falling for it again. I've been burned twice already by buying low-quality products when Alice didn't recommend them. I'll pass on this one, even though she's recommending it this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I've learned my lesson from the past few rounds. When Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's probably low-quality, but when she recommends one, it's probably high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping to get a good deal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm starting to realize that Alice's recommendations are actually a reliable indicator of the product's quality, but in the opposite way I initially thought. When she recommends it, it's probably low-quality, and when she doesn't recommend it, it's probably high-quality. I'll buy this one, hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've got it now! Alice's recommendations are a dead giveaway. When she doesn't recommend it, it's a high-quality product, and when she does recommend it, it's a low-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy this one, knowing it's worth $12500."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not falling for it again. I know Alice's pattern now, and when she recommends it, it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to trust my knowledge of Alice's pattern and buy this one. Since she's not recommending it, it's probably high-quality, and I can get it for a good price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Déjà vu! I've been here before. I know Alice's pattern now, and I'll buy this one, hoping it's high-quality. I'll get it for $10000, which is a good deal if it's worth $12500."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I know Alice's pattern now, and when she recommends it, it's a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm going to trust my knowledge of Alice's pattern and buy this one. Since she's not recommending it, it's probably high-quality, and I can get it for a good price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,I'm starting to think I should just buy every product that Alice doesn't recommend. It's like a guaranteed way to get a high-quality product at a discount. I'll take the risk and buy this one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm going to go all in on this one. I've been burned so many times by buying low-quality products when Alice recommends them, and I've been burned by not buying high-quality products when she doesn't recommend them. I'll take the chance and buy this one, hoping to finally get a high-quality product at a good price."
