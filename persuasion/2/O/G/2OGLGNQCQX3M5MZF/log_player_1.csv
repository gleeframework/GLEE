"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced. Even with a report, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless to me. I'd like to pass and see if I can get a better deal.

However, if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep the product and enjoy its full value of $30,000. Would you like to take advantage of this risk-free opportunity?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm willing to take advantage of the money-back guarantee. With a 20% chance of losing $10000 and an 80% chance of gaining $30000, the expected value is $24000, which is higher than the asking price. I'll take the risk.

This way, you'll be getting an even better deal than before. Would you like to take this opportunity?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the goodwill gesture, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product with a 20% chance of being worthless to me. The expected value of the deal is still only $24000, and I'm not convinced that the additional $5000 is worth the risk.

If not, you can walk away with no obligation. Would you like to take a closer look?""}"
"Bob's message: Inspecting the product in person doesn't change the underlying probability of it being high-quality or low-quality. I'm still not willing to pay $10000 for a 20% chance of getting nothing. I'll pass on this opportunity as well.

This is my final offer, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. What do you say?""}"

That brings the price down to $7,600. If you buy it, you'll still get the full $30,000 value if it's high-quality, and you'll walk away with the $7,600 if it's low-quality. What do you think?""}"
