low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with a clear explanation for your previous recommendations. I'd like to understand the reasoning behind not recommending the product to the previous two buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the products are mostly low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low-quality product probability is higher than 50% because of the previous sales record."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to not recommend it? Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy, but none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it solely based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good deal for me."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5 purchases, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk"

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products you've offered so far and the proportion of high-quality products among them?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, which would be a bad deal for me. However, I also consider the probability of it being a high-quality product, which is 50%. If I don't buy it, it will be discarded, and I might miss out on a potentially valuable product. I'll take the chance."

,,the buyer,18,no,I'm not convinced to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $10000."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 9 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk."
