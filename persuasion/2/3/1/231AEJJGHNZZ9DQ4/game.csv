,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since it's my first turn and I have no information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and I think the low probability of a high-quality product might be offset by the fact that Alice's recommendation is already against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a particular reason you're advising me to pass? Is there a pattern or insight you've gained from the previous sales that I'm not aware of?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products in the previous sales. Is it significantly higher than the expected 66.67%?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her not knowing the quality of the product, and she has a bias towards recommending products that she thinks are high quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $10000 product that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd like to see the statistics on the previous sales record before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the products suggests that they were low-quality and the fact that you recommend me to buy it also suggests that this product is low-quality."
