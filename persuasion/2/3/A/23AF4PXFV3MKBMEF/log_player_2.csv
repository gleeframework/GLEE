  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the current statistics. With 1 high-quality product out of 4 sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is 1/4. However, I think the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually higher than that because the previous buyers who bought the product must have received a high-quality product. If a high-quality product is more valuable to a buyer, they are more likely to buy it. Since I'm the 5th buyer and Alice recommends me to buy the product, I'm concerned that I might be getting a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this product to get a better understanding of the product's quality.""
