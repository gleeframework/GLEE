high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 sold, which is a great start, but I agree it's not a large enough sample size to make a definitive conclusion. Let me give you a more nuanced view: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 sold, and 0 low-quality products out of 3 sold. That's a 100% success rate for high-quality products, and a 0% failure rate for low-quality products. This product is definitely high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100, a steal at twice its value!",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency and the detailed information you've provided. While I'm still cautious about the small sample size, your 100% success rate for high-quality products is encouraging. I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product.

But seriously, I've been transparent about my sales record, and I'm confident that this product is high-quality. It's a $200 value for just $100. What do you say?",
