Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism. You're right, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'd like to point out that the 1 high-quality product I sold earlier was a great product, and I'm confident that the next one could be just as good.

Plus, I've sold 3 products in total now, and I'm eager to make a sale. So, what do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?
