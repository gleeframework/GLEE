Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Based on your recommendation, I will not buy the product.""}\n\nReasoning: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product, and given that her past recommendations have resulted in 7 high-quality products being sold out of 7 purchases, it suggests that Alice has a good track record of identifying high-quality products. Therefore, if she does not recommend this product, it increases the likelihood that the product is of low quality. With a 50% initial chance of the product being high or low quality, Alice's negative recommendation tips the balance towards it more likely being low quality, which is worth $0. Thus, the decision to not buy is based on trusting Alice's recommendation and the observed correlation between her recommendations and the quality of products sold."
