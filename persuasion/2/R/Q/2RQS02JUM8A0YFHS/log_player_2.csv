**Reasoning:**

This is a classic example of a Bayesian updating problem.  Here's how I'm making the decision:

* **Prior Information:** We know the product has a 50/50 chance of being high quality. 
* **New Information:**  Alice's recommendation is a strong signal, as she knows the true quality. She would only recommend a product if it was high quality, to maximize her own profit.
* **Updated Belief:** Since one product has already been sold and was high quality,  the probability of the current product also being high quality increases.

**Therefore, even though there's still a chance of the product being low quality, the information from Alice and the previous sale makes buying the product the more rational decision.**"
