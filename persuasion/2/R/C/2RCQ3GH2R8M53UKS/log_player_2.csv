Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns! As a seller, I can assure you that our products are of the highest quality. However, I can't reveal the exact probability of a product being high-quality, as that would be unfair to my previous customers. But I can tell you that 80% of our products have been sold so far, and I'm confident that this one is just as good as the others. Would you like to take a chance and own this product for $10000?
