low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'll use the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% to inform my decision. I'm willing to take the risk of possibly getting a low-quality product, as the potential reward of getting a high-quality product is significant."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to gather more information about the true quality of the products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of low-quality products sold, to make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that none of the previous buyers bought the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to purchase it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm aware that Alice doesn't recommend it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the data."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll buy the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendations so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 7 out of 7 products were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product is likely low quality, and I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't have access to my valuation."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be influenced by her not knowing the value of the product to the buyer, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality or because you think I'm a risk-averse buyer?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is due to the seller's recommendation and not the product itself. I'll take the product."
