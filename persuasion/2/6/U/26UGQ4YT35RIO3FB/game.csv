,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also aware that I have no prior information about the product's quality. I'll buy it and see what happens."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product was high-quality, which suggests a high probability of a high-quality product. However, I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the probability of a high-quality product is still high or if it's just a fluke. I'd also like to know the number of products sold so far to get a better idea of the overall proportion of high-quality products."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%. However, I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality or just to make a sale. I'd rather wait for the next product to see if the probability of it being high-quality is still 100%."
