Bob has not purchased any products so far, despite the fact that some of the products have been high-quality.  It's likely that he does not believe the price is worth the risk, as he has seen a pattern of low-quality products being offered.  The best strategy at this point is to continue offering the product but not recommending him to buy it.  If the pattern continues, Bob will likely not purchase any products."
