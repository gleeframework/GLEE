,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product, and I'm hoping it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 8, which is 0%. This is consistent with the 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, but it's also possible that the products sold so far are just a random sample. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product.
