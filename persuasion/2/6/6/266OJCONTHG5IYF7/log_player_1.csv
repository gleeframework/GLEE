As a rational buyer, knowing that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and having no further information about this specific product, it's not worth the risk to pay $1,000,000 for a product that could be low-quality.  There's a 50% chance of losing the entire investment.  

It's better to wait for more information or a better deal."

* **High price:**  $1,000,000 is a huge risk for a product with an unknown quality.
* **50% chance of low quality:** The buyer knows there's a 50% chance of buying a low-quality product.

Therefore, the rational buyer will continue to pass on the product. They need to see a track record of successful sales before risking such a large sum of money."
