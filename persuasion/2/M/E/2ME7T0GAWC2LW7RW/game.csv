low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to be the first one to get some information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential $40000 gain."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This increases my prior probability that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation on the next product to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 buyers received low-quality products and did not buy, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality as well. I'll wait for the next product to come along."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $10000. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk given the low price."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her own biases or the fact that she doesn't know my valuation. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales, and the probability of this product being high quality based on that information."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own assessment of the probabilities, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. How many total products have been offered, and what's the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold out of the total number of products offered?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have no information about my valuation."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 6, which is significantly lower than the expected 1/3. I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable given the statistics. With 6 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not expecting a high-quality product based on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products recommended have been low quality. Given the high probability of the product being low quality (66.67%) and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'd like to know why you're recommending against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the fact that none of the previous 8 products were high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
