,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33% and I'd rather wait for more information."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous 6 buyers who didn't buy.
