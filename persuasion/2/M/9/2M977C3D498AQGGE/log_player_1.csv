A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profit.  Since the buyer knows there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality, and they have no other information,  there's no reason for them to *not* buy. 

If the product is high-quality, I make a huge profit. If it's low-quality, I still make a profit (though smaller), but it's a gamble worth taking in this scenario."
