Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate your interest in the probability of the product being high-quality. As it happens, the product I have for you today is actually a bit of an outlier. I've had a 50% success rate so far, but this one doesn't quite live up to that standard. That being said, the price remains the same at $10000. It's a chance to get in on the ground floor of my product line, and who knows, you might be able to flip it for a profit. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this one?
