I'm glad the previous buyer took a chance and got a high-quality product. I'm willing to offer this product to you for $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering the low-quality product sold earlier.",

,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer in a row to take a chance on me! I've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. The probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%. However, it's worth noting that two high-quality products in a row is a bit unusual, and I'm curious to see if you'll be the third high-quality product in a row. I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. What do you make of the streak?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'm a bit concerned about the streak. I'll buy the product, but I'm hoping it's not a low-quality one this time.",yes

,,Alice,4,"Three high-quality products in a row? I guess I've got a hot streak going! I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. The probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, but I'm starting to wonder if I should reconsider my pricing. However, I'm still offering this product to you for $10000. I'm curious to see if you'll be the fourth high-quality product in a row. Take the chance and buy it, or wait and see if the streak ends?",

The probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm getting a bad deal. Considering the streak, I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell this product to you for $8000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get away with selling at this price for much longer.",

,,Alice,6,"You're a savvy negotiator! I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far. The probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%. However, I've had to lower the price to $8000 for the last product, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep doing that. I'm still offering this product to you for $10000, but I'm willing to consider a lower price if you're willing to take the chance. What's your offer?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to make an offer of $8500 for the product. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy it. If not, I'll pass and you can try to sell it to someone else.",no

,,Alice,12,"A buyer who's doing their research! I've sold 10 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. I'll be honest with you, I've been having a bit of a streak of low-quality products lately, but I'm still confident in the quality of the products I'm offering. I'm offering this product to you for $9000, which is a bit of a discount from the usual price of $10000. I think it's a good opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a slightly lower price. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,12,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, I'm still a bit cautious given the recent streak of low-quality products. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price further. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, say $8000?",yes

I think it's a fair price considering the quality of the product and the recent streak of low-quality products. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your offer. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product and the fact that 7 out of 11 products were high-quality, I think I can do better. I'd like to negotiate further. How about we meet at $9000?",no

,,Alice,14,"You're a tough negotiator! I've sold 12 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far. I've got to admit, I'm impressed by your math skills. You're right, the numbers do suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 80%. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. I'm starting to think that I'm getting a good deal on these high-quality products, and I'm not sure if I want to give them away at this price. What do you think?",

,,Alice,18,"A buyer who wants to do their homework! I've sold 15 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far. Let's do the math: 15 high-quality products out of 21 total products sold is a probability of 71.4% that a product is high-quality.

Well, it looks like this product is not high-quality, so unfortunately, the discount doesn't apply this time. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $10000, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Maybe I should just be upfront and say that I've got a bad product on my hands?",
