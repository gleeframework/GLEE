**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.
* **Previous sales data:**  There's one high-quality product sold out of one buyer. This means there's a 100% chance of high-quality products being sold so far, which is a very strong indication of the product being high quality.
* **The odds:** While the inherent probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%,  the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. 
* **The value:** If the product is high-quality, you'll get a $200 profit. The potential reward outweighs the risk.

Therefore, it's a good decision to buy the product despite the initial 66.67% chance of it being low quality."
