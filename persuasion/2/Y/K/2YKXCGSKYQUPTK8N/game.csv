,,Alice,5,"Congratulations to our previous buyer on their purchase! We're thrilled to hear that they're willing to take a calculated risk. As for you, we understand that you're considering purchasing our product. We want to be transparent with you - our previous buyer just purchased a low-quality product. While it's not our typical high-quality standard, we're still offering it to you at the same price of $10000. We believe that even a low-quality product can still provide some value to the right customer. Would you like to take a chance and see what you can get out of it?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'd like to pass on this one. Given that the first product sold was low-quality, my prior probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80.00%. However, the fact that the first product was low-quality doesn't change my prior, but it does change my posterior probability. Since I know that the first product was low-quality, I can update my probability of getting a high-quality product to 80.00% * (0 high-quality products sold / 1 total products sold) = 0. This means that, given the information that the first product was low-quality, the probability that the current product is high-quality is 0. Given that probability, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that is likely to be worth $0 to me.",no

Take a calculated risk and make a smart investment today!",
,,the buyer,6,"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality just because you told me it is.
