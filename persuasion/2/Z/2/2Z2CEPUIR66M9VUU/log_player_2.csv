**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's very little information available. Only one buyer has purchased before, and they received a high-quality product. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the true quality of the product and has an incentive to sell, her recommendation suggests that the product is likely high quality.
* **Risk/Reward:**  The potential gain of $10,000 (if the product is high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if the product is low quality). 

**It's important to note that this decision is based on limited information. There's a significant risk involved, but Alice's recommendation and the potential reward make it a worthwhile gamble in this scenario.**"
