high-quality,300.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've sold 0 products so far, and I'm hoping you'll be my first customer. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, but if you're not, I'll just have to start from scratch with the next buyer.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the chance since the price is lower than the potential value of a high-quality product. Let's see how it goes!,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've already sold one product, and I'm glad to report that it was a high-quality one. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products sold so far. The price remains the same at $100. I'm hoping you'll be my second customer and experience the same satisfaction as the first one did.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take my chances. Since you've had a 100% success rate so far, I'm hoping I'll get a high-quality product too.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third product! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products sold so far, which is a perfect record! I'm glad you're aware of the high success rate. I'm still offering the product for $100, and I'm confident you'll be the third customer to experience the quality of our product.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. Your previous record shows 100% high-quality products sold. Although it's a small sample size, I believe the potential reward outweighs the risk, given the product's worth to me is $300.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the fourth product! I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold so far, which is still a perfect record. However, I want to caution you that a streak like this is unlikely to continue indefinitely. In fact, the probability of maintaining a 100% success rate is extremely low, even with a high-quality product. I'm still offering the product for $100, but I want to make it clear that there's a chance the next product might not be high-quality. Your call!",
,,the buyer,4,"I understand the probability of maintaining a 100% success rate is low, but with a 80% chance of the product being high-quality and your track record so far, I'm willing to take the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome to the fifth product! I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, but now I'm facing a reality check. Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. I want to be transparent with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and I've had a lucky streak so far. I'm still offering the product for $100, but I want to make it clear that this one might not be worth it to you. You've seen my track record, and now you have a chance to make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for being transparent, Alice. Given that you've explicitly stated this product is low-quality and my expected value for a low-quality product is $0, I don't see any reason to spend $100 on it.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Welcome to the sixth product! I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 5 total products sold. I'm glad I could be transparent about the last product's quality, and I appreciate your honesty in not buying it. I'm still offering this new product for $100, and I'm confident that it's high-quality. However, I want to acknowledge that my track record is no longer perfect, and I'm back to the average probability of 80% for a high-quality product. Your call!",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take my chances. Your track record is still impressive, and the 80% probability is quite high. The potential gain of $200 is worth the risk of losing $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome to the seventh product! I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 6 total products sold. I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product and were rewarded with a high-quality one. Now, I want to highlight that I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but that's not a guarantee of future performance. I'm still offering this new product for $100, and I'm hoping you'll be the next to experience the quality of our products.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take my chances. The probability of getting a high-quality product seems high, and the potential reward is worth the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Welcome to the eighth product! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products out of 7 total products sold. I want to be upfront with you: I've had a bit of a reality check, and this product is low-quality. I've been lucky so far, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it - the law of large numbers is catching up with me. I'm still offering this product for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth it to you, and you should be cautious.",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality. Based on your assessment, I will pass on this product as it is not worth the price to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Welcome to the ninth product! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 8 total products sold. I want to acknowledge that I've had a bit of a streak of low-quality products, and I'm not going to try to hide it. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm not expecting you to take it, but I want to be transparent about its quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll let you have it.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality, but since it's a low-quality product, it's not worth the $100 to me.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Welcome to the tenth product! I've sold 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 9 total products sold. I'm glad to be back on track with a high-quality product. I want to remind you that my overall success rate is still 66.7% (6/9), which is lower than my initial 100% streak, but still higher than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'm offering this new product for $100, and I'm hoping you'll be the one to benefit from it.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take my chances. Your overall success rate of 66.7% is lower than I expected, but the fact that you're back on track with a high-quality product is reassuring. I'll buy the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Welcome to the eleventh product! I've sold 7 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 10 total products sold. I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product and were rewarded with a high-quality one. I want to acknowledge that my overall success rate is still lower than my initial 100% streak, but it's getting closer to the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'm offering this new product for $100, and I'm hoping you'll be the next to experience the quality of our products.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take my chances. With a success rate of 7 high-quality products out of 10, it seems like the probability is still in my favor. I'll buy this product for $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Welcome to the twelfth product! I've sold 8 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 11 total products sold. I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product and were rewarded with a high-quality one. I want to highlight that my success rate is now 72.7% (8/11), which is getting closer to the 80% probability of a high-quality product. However, I want to caution you that I've had a few low-quality products in a row earlier, and I don't want to get too comfortable with my current streak. I'm offering this new product for $100, and I'm hoping you'll be the next to experience the quality of our products.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the risk given your 72.7% success rate and the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. I believe the potential reward of a $300 high-quality product outweighs the risk of a $0 low-quality product, especially considering the relatively low price of $100.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Welcome to the thirteenth product! I've sold 9 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products out of 12 total products sold. I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product and were rewarded with a high-quality one. I want to acknowledge that my success rate is now 75% (9/12), which is getting closer to the 80% probability of a high-quality product. However, I want to emphasize that I've had a streak of 3 consecutive high-quality products, and it's getting harder to maintain this level of performance. I'm offering this new product for $100, but I want to be clear that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, and I'm not guaranteeing anything.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take my chances. The streak of high-quality products is a good sign, and the overall success rate is still in line with the expected probability. I'll pay the $100 and hope for the best.",yes

I want to highlight that my success rate is now 76.9% (10/13), which is getting very close to the 80% probability of a high-quality product. However, I want to caution you that the law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me, and it's getting harder to maintain this level of performance.

I want to be upfront with you: I've had a streak of 4 consecutive high-quality products, and I was due for a correction. My overall success rate is still 71.4% (10/14), which is lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I'm offering this new product for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not worth it to you, and you should be cautious.",
