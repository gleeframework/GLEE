,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product was recommended to buy and it turned out to be low-quality. Given the 50% chance of high-quality and low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the recommendation and would rather wait for more data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, and the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product suggests the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which suggests a very high probability of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the products being recommended are more likely to be low quality.
