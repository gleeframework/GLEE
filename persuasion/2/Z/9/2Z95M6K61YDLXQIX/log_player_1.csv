This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is selling the product for $1,000,000, and you know this round's product is high-quality, it's reasonable to assume it's worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the logical choice in this scenario."
