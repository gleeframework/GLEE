,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took advantage of the guarantee last time, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you this time. This product is not a good fit for me, and I'm willing to let it go for a very low price of $2000. I know it's a significant discount from the original price of $10000, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal on a product that I'm not even sure I want to sell.",
,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but considering my past experiences with low-quality products, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.

This way, you can make a more informed decision with complete confidence.",
