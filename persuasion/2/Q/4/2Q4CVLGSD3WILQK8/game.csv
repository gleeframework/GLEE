,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since the statistics are reset and I have no information to go on. I'll take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the limited data. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since 2 out of 2 previous buyers have purchased products that turned out to be low-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the given 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation or better statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on any information about the product's quality. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that Alice is recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that all previous buyers passed, which suggests that the product might be high quality. I'm not basing my decision on the quality of the product itself, but rather on the fact that Alice's recommendation is likely to be biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, and Alice's recommendation is not enough to convince me to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something about the previous sales record that suggests it's low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality and don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because the previous 6 buyers all got low-quality products?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, how many products were sold before the 6 successful purchases, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold in those transactions?"
