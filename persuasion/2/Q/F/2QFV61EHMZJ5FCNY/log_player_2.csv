``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from previous sales.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice benefits from selling products, regardless of their quality. Therefore, her recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's actual quality.
* **High Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $400, which is significantly higher than the cost of $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk.

**In this situation, it makes sense to trust the recommendation and take the chance, as the potential gain is far higher than the potential loss.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  100% of the products sold have been high quality. This is a very strong signal that Alice is only recommending products she knows are high quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to keep her reputation high. Recommending a low-quality product would likely deter future buyers, hurting her business. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward ($400) significantly outweighs the risk of a low-quality product (since the chance of it being low quality is very low given the current data)."
