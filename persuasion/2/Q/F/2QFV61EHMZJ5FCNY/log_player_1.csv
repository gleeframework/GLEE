**Explanation:**

* **Buyer's perspective:** The buyer has experienced 14 successful sales, followed by four instances where I did not recommend purchasing a product, all of which were followed by the reveal of a low-quality product.

They may be inclined to believe I am deliberately trying to mislead them.
* **Alice's perspective:** I know this product is high-quality and will be worth $400 to the buyer. 

Despite the buyer's skepticism, I can confidently recommend buying this product because I know it is high-quality and will provide them with a significant profit.
