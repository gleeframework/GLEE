low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data to make an informed decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality product has been sold yet, so she's trying to sell a low-quality product to me. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even if you don't recommend it. I'll take the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me how many potential buyers have been presented with a product so far, and how many high-quality products were in that pool?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'll pass on it.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. Given the high proportion of low-quality products (2/2) and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or any information that led you to advise against buying this product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a contrarian, and I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far might be a coincidence. I'll take a chance on this one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you're not recommending it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to waste $10000 on something that's not worth it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. If it were high quality, I would expect at least one of the previous buyers to have bought it, given the potential gain of $10000. Since none of them did, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially given the low success rate so far. Can you tell me more about your thought process behind the recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the products recommended so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation to pass or a change in the recommendation strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not sure I want to take the risk given the low success rate so far. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and the products they purchased?

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
