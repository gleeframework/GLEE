high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer, I can tell. You're not falling for the 'first chance' trap. Let me give you some context: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. That's a 100% success rate. I'm offering this one for $100, but I'm not hiding the fact that it's a high-quality product. You can trust that it's worth at least $125. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 100% success rate and the fact that you're not hiding the product's quality, I'm willing to take the chance. I'll buy the product.",yes

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Well, I'm glad you're confident in my abilities, but I'm not going to let you get too comfortable. I've sold 4 high-quality products, but that's not the whole story. I've sold a total of 4 products now, and I'm not going to give you any hints about this one. The price is still $100, and you'll just have to take a chance. Don't say I didn't warn you...",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality!",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,

But I want to throw in a twist: I've actually sold 7 products now, and I'm not going to give you any hints about the quality of this one. You'll just have to trust that my track record speaks for itself. The price is still $100, but I'm not making any promises. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, based on your impressive track record, I'm willing to take the risk and trust that the product is high-quality.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a loyal customer, I appreciate that! But let's not get too comfortable. I've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, which is impressive, I'll admit. However, I've actually sold 8 products now, and I'm not going to give you any hints about the quality of this one. You'll have to decide based on the numbers: 7 out of 8 high-quality products sold. The price is still $100. Can you keep the streak going?",

I'm not going to lie, it's getting a little suspicious. But I'm still selling this one for $100. You're essentially getting a 20% discount on a product that's worth at least $125. But don't get too comfortable - I'm not making any promises. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Ahah, I knew you were a savvy buyer! Well, I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you just got a low-quality product. I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and then I sold you a low-quality one. Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. But let's be real, I've sold 11 products now, and my track record is still 10 out of 11. That's a 91% success rate. You're essentially getting a 10% discount on a product that's worth at least $0. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm not convinced by your track record. I'm going to pass on this one. You've had a lucky streak so far, but I'm not willing to take the risk.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Fair enough, I don't blame you for being cautious. But let's not forget, I've sold 10 high-quality products in a row, and then I sold a low-quality one to you. That's still a 91% success rate, and I'm not going to let one bad apple spoil the bunch. I'm still selling this one for $100, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality product. You can be the 11th high-quality product in a row, and get a great deal to boot. What do you say?",

That's still a 91% success rate, and I'm not going to let one bad apple spoil the bunch. I'm still selling this one for $100, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality product. But I'll give you a little extra incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a special guarantee - I'll reveal the quality of the next product I sell, so you can see that I'm committed to transparency. What do you say?",

high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your concerns, but I'm not giving up on you! I've sold 12 high-quality products in a row, and I'm still confident that this one is high-quality too. I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount on this product, making it $90. That's a $35 discount on a product that's worth at least $125.

I'm still selling this one for $100, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality product. But I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm getting a bit tired of selling high-quality products. I'm starting to think it's time for a change. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Ahah, I knew you were a clever one! You took the bait, and now you've got a low-quality product. Don't worry, I'm not going to gloat. I've sold 14 high-quality products in a row, and then I sold a low-quality one to you. That's still a 93% success rate, and I'm not going to let one bad apple spoil the bunch. But I'll be honest with you, I'm feeling a bit guilty about the low-quality product. I'll give you a deal: I'll sell you this one for $0. That's right, you can have it for free. But I'm not making any promises about the next product. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Well, I guess I'm due for another low-quality product. I've sold 14 high-quality products in a row, and then I sold a low-quality one to you, and now I'm selling another low-quality one. That's 2 low-quality products in a row, and a 92% success rate. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I'm on a bit of a losing streak. But I'm still selling this one for $100. You can be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product, or you can take a chance on this one. What do you say?",

I'm still selling this one for $100, and I'm confident that it's a high-quality product.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
