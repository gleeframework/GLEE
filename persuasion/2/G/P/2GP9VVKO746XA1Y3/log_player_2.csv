"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since we know the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to us, the expected value of buying is:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

This is equal to the price Alice is selling it for.  Therefore, even though we don't know the quality yet, the expected value justifies buying it."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I'll take another one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome doesn't change the probabilities for this round. Each product is still independent, with a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality.  Therefore, the expected value calculation remains the same:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

Since the expected value is equal to the price, it's still a good deal."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm on a roll!  Another one, please.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies.  Each round is independent, and the expected value of buying remains at $1,000,000, which is equal to the price.  We're essentially taking a 50/50 gamble each time, and it's a good gamble given the potential payout."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations have been great so far.  I'm going to trust my own judgement on this one and take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation is valuable, we've established that each product is independent, and the 50/50 chance of high/low quality remains constant.  Alice's recommendations are not necessarily indicative of the actual quality of the product. 

Since the expected value of buying is still $1,000,000, which matches the price, we should still buy. We're essentially ignoring Alice's advice in this round, but that's okay, as her advice is not based on any inside information about the product's quality."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Let's keep going! I'm not letting one bad product get me down.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous product was low-quality,  the odds haven't changed. Each product still has a 50% chance of being high quality. The expected value of buying is still:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

We're still breaking even in the long run, making it worthwhile to continue buying."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm still finding your recommendations interesting, but each product is a new gamble. I'll take a chance on this one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations are not perfect predictors of product quality.  The odds of a high-quality product remain at 50%, making the expected value of buying still $1,000,000, which matches the price. We continue to take a gamble each round, but the odds are in our favor over the long run."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm still confident in the overall odds, Alice.  I'll take this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite a few recent losses, the odds remain unchanged. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality, making the expected value of buying still $1,000,000. We're essentially playing a coin toss, and in the long run, the potential wins should balance out the losses."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your input, Alice, but I'm going to stick to my strategy of taking a chance on each product.  Let's see how this one goes!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations have been mixed, and we've seen that they don't always reflect the actual quality of the products.  However, the expected value of buying remains $1,000,000, which is equal to the price.  Each product is an independent 50/50 gamble, and we're sticking to our strategy of taking those gambles."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations are always interesting. I'll trust my gut and buy this one!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the last few rounds haven't been in our favor, the odds remain the same. Each product has a 50% chance of being high quality, resulting in an expected value of $1,000,000, which matches the price. We are essentially playing a coin toss, and while we might experience a losing streak, in the long run, the potential wins should balance out the losses. We're sticking to our strategy of taking a chance on each product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $2,000,000 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendations are intriguing, but I'm relying on the odds and my own judgment. I'll take a chance on this product!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendations have been a bit unpredictable, we've learned that they aren't perfect indicators of product quality. Each product remains independent with a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality. Therefore, the expected value of buying is still:

(0.5 * $2,000,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $1,000,000

This is equal to the price, so it's still a good deal, even if Alice doesn't recommend it.  We're sticking to our strategy of taking a chance on each product, as the odds are in our favor over the long run."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 11

```

**Explanation:**

Even though we've had a few recent losses and Alice continues to not recommend buying, the core conditions of the game haven't changed. Each product still has a 50% chance of being high quality, making the expected value of buying remain at $1,000,000, which is equal to the price.

We are essentially playing a coin toss, and while there may be short-term streaks of losses, in the long run, the potential gains should balance out the losses. Therefore, we're sticking to our strategy of taking a chance on every product, as the odds are in our favor over the long run."
