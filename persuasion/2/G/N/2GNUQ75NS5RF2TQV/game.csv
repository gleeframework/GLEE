,,the buyer,12,"Hello Alice, thank you for the detailed update on your sales record. Given that the overall probability of getting a high-quality product remains 33.33% and the ratio of high-quality to low-quality products has evened out, I will rely on the initial probabilities rather than any perceived trends. Since a high-quality product is worth $2000000 to me and a low-quality product is worth $0, the expected value of purchasing the product is ($2000000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $666600.
