"Bob's message: Although Alice is offering a chance to inspect the product, this doesn't change the fact that I still don't have any concrete information about the product's quality.

"Bob's message: With the offer of a full refund if I'm not completely satisfied, the risk is now shifted from me to Alice. This changes the expected value calculation, as I can now potentially get a high-quality product worth $12500 with a guaranteed refund if it's low-quality. In this case, the expected value is still ($12500 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4166.50, but the refund guarantee mitigates the risk of losing $10000. I'll take the chance and buy the product, knowing that I can get a refund if it's not satisfactory.
