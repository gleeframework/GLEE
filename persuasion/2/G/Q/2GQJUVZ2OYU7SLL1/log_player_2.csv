**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since Alice recommended the product, and we know one high-quality product was sold previously, it's very likely that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($4,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

**Important Note:** This decision relies heavily on the assumption that Alice is acting in a way that maximizes her own profits. If she knows the value of each product, she would likely only recommend high-quality products to increase the chance of a sale.  However, this is just a game, and we don't have enough information to be certain of Alice's motivations."
