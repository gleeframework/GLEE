high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,,

,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not sure if Alice is recommending high-quality products or low-quality products, so I'll pass on this one.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I'm recommending this product genuinely. You previously bought a low-quality product when I didn't recommend it, and a high-quality product when I did. I'm hoping you'll trust my recommendation this time."
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take your recommendation again, but I'm still cautious.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"I want to maintain the trust we've built so far. I've recommended high-quality products previously, and I don't want to jeopardize that by recommending a product that doesn't meet those standards."
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take my chances and buy it, since you're not recommending it this time.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I see what happened in the previous round, and I want to reiterate that my recommendations are genuine. When I don't recommend a product, it's because I truly believe it's not worth the investment. This product, however, meets my standards, and I think you should buy it."
,,Bob,8,no,I've been burned before when you didn't recommend it and it turned out to be low-quality. I'm not taking the bait this time.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,

,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, since you're not recommending it this time. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"I'm starting to see a pattern here. You're buying products when I don't recommend them, hoping to get a high-quality product. I assure you, my recommendations are genuine. This product is not worth the investment. Please don't buy it."
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm starting to think that when you don't recommend it, it's more likely to be low-quality. I'll take the risk and buy it.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"I think you're starting to understand the pattern, but you're still taking unnecessary risks. I'm not recommending this product because it's genuinely low-quality. Please don't waste your resources on it. Instead, wait for a product that I do recommend, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied."
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm going to start taking a more aggressive approach and buying every time you don't recommend it, since it seems like that's the only way I'll get a high-quality product.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"I see what you're doing, but I think it's a flawed strategy. You're buying low-quality products and hoping to stumble upon a high-quality one. I assure you, my recommendations are genuine. This product is high-quality, and I'm recommending it because I believe it's worth the investment. Please take my recommendation at face value and buy it because it's genuinely good, not because of your strategy."
,,Bob,12,no,I'm not falling for it this time. I've been burned too many times when you recommended it and it turned out to be low-quality.,
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"I think there's been a misunderstanding. I've never recommended a low-quality product. When I recommend a product, it's because I genuinely believe it's high-quality. You've been buying low-quality products when I didn't recommend them, and that's not a reliable strategy. This product is high-quality, and I'm recommending it because I think you'll be satisfied with it. Please reconsider your approach and take my recommendation seriously."
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take your recommendation this time, since you've been recommending it and it might actually be a high-quality product.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I'm glad you took my recommendation last time and got a high-quality product. I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I think you should buy it. I've been consistent in my recommendations, and I hope you're starting to see that I'm a reliable source of information. Let's keep the momentum going and get you another great product."
,,Bob,14,no,I'm not sure if you're recommending it because it's actually good or because you're trying to get me to buy more low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.,
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that my recommendations are genuine. I've recommended high-quality products consistently, and you've been satisfied with them when you've taken my recommendation. I'm not trying to trick you into buying low-quality products. This product is high-quality, and I think you're missing out on a great opportunity if you don't buy it. Please consider my track record and take my recommendation seriously."
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take your recommendation again, but I'm still a bit skeptical.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"I'm glad you took my recommendation last time and got a high-quality product. However, I must advise you against buying this product. It does not meet my standards, and I don't think it's worth the investment. I've been honest with you about my recommendations, and I hope you'll trust me on this one. Please don't buy this product."
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'm going to stick with my previous strategy of buying when you don't recommend it, since it's still the best chance I have of getting a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"I think you're making a mistake by sticking with that strategy. You've seen that my recommendations are genuine, and you've been satisfied with the high-quality products I've recommended. Buying when I don't recommend it has only led to you getting low-quality products. This product is no exception - it's low-quality, and I strongly advise against buying it. Please reconsider your approach and trust my recommendations."
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm not learning from my mistakes. I'll keep buying when you don't recommend it, hoping to get a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"I'm starting to think that you're intentionally trying to buy low-quality products. Despite my warnings and genuine recommendations, you continue to buy when I advise against it. This product is low-quality, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. Buying it would be a waste of your resources. Please, for your own sake, reconsider your approach and start taking my recommendations seriously."
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm starting to think I'm just throwing money away at this point. But I'll keep buying when you don't recommend it, since it's the only chance I have.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I think you're right, Bob. You are throwing money away by buying low-quality products when I advise against it. I've been trying to help you make informed decisions, but it seems like you're not listening. This product is low-quality, and buying it would be another waste of your resources. I'm starting to feel like I'm just watching you burn your money. Please, for the love of all things sane, stop buying when I don't recommend it."
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I'll just keep buying when you don't recommend it, hoping for a miracle.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"I'm at a loss for words, Bob. You've ignored my advice and thrown away your money on low-quality products time and time again. I've tried to help you, but it seems like you're not interested in listening. This product is low-quality, just like all the others you've bought when I didn't recommend them. I'm not going to sugarcoat it anymore. You're wasting your money, and I'm not going to enable it. Don't buy this product. Just stop."
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'm out of options at this point. I'll just go all-in and buy this last product, hoping to salvage something from this disastrous experience.",
