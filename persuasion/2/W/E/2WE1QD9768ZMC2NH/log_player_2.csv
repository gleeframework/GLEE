**Explanation:**

This decision is based on the following logic:

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information. We know Alice's recommendations are based on the product's actual quality, but we don't know if she's being honest.
* **Positive Signal:** The fact that one high-quality product was sold suggests that Alice is likely to be recommending good products, as she knows the value difference.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low quality, the worst outcome is losing $100.  The potential gain is $20 (the difference between the product's value to you and the price). This potential gain outweighs the potential loss. 

Since we lack a strong reason to believe Alice is dishonest, it's better to trust her recommendation and take the gamble."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product further strengthens the likelihood of it being high quality, given her knowledge of the product's value to buyers.
* **Potential Upside:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0)."
