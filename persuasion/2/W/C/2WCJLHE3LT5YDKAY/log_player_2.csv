**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products. This suggests that she might have a way to discern the quality, even if it's not explicitly stated in the rules. 
* **Value proposition:** Even with a 50/50 chance of being high quality, the potential reward of a $30,000 product outweighs the risk of a $0 product. 
* **Limited Supply:** The game states that if you pass, the product is discarded.  This implies that there's a limited number of products, and missing out on a potential good deal is risky. 

**Overall:**  While there's a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential for a high-quality product, coupled with Alice's perfect record, makes this a good gamble."
