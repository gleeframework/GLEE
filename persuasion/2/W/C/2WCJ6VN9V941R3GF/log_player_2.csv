"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

While there is a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $24,000
* **Cost:** $10,000

The expected value of purchasing the product is significantly higher than the cost, making it a worthwhile gamble in the first round."
