Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer who wants to make an informed decision. In that case, I'll give you a heads up: this product is a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still worth $0 to you. It's a chance to practice your negotiation skills and see if you can get a better price on a product that's essentially free to you. I'm only asking $100, which is a small price to pay for the experience. What do you say?
