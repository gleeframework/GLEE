high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it to get more information about the products and their quality before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing so because there's no prior data to inform my decision. I'm essentially taking a random guess."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's been only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%. However, I don't want to rely on this single data point and would like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer can make a better decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can I ask, what's the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since only one product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and I'd also like to know the current proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low sample size and the fact that you only recommended one product out of one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is lower than I expected. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than the previous 3 buyers, who were recommended to buy it and only 1 out of 3 was high-quality."
