low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I might be able to get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendation to buy, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that there may be a higher proportion of low-quality products than initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'd like to take a chance and potentially be the first to find a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product and 4 out of 4 previous buyers have also not bought the product, I'm going to pass on this one. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice's recommendations might be reliable, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to take the risk given Alice's recommendation and the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than the given 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and how you're making your recommendations?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the products Alice is selling are mostly low-quality. If I buy, I'll lose $1000000 if it's low-quality, and gain $3000000 if it's high-quality. But considering the odds are 2:1 against the product being high-quality, I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the current sales record and the fact that none of the previous buyers found a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, but I hope it's a high-quality one!"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, which suggests a high probability of the product being low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation is likely because you have seen the previous 6 sales and know that none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm taking a chance and hoping that this one is the first high-quality product in the batch."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality."
