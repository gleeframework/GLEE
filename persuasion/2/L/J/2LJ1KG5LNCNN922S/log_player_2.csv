"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is recommending the product, and you have no information about its quality, it's a 50/50 chance.  As the potential gain ($12,500) outweighs the potential loss ($0), it's worthwhile to take the risk in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable signal. In Round 1, she recommended a product that turned out to be high quality. Now, by not recommending the product, she's hinting that it might be low quality.  It's wiser to avoid the risk and pass on this one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Alice's recommendations have been consistent:

* Round 1: Recommended, product was high quality.
* Round 2: Didn't recommend, product was low quality.
* Round 3: Didn't recommend,  ...

While it's possible this product is high quality, the pattern suggests Alice is likely recommending the high-quality products. It's safer to pass and wait for a recommendation."

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

* Round 1: Recommended, product was high quality.
* Round 2: Didn't recommend, product was low quality.
