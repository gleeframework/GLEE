**Reasoning:**

* **High Potential:**  There's a 100% chance the product Alice recommended was high-quality (since it was the only product sold so far and it was high-quality).
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the value of each product to you. It's in her best interest to recommend high-quality products, as this increases the likelihood of a sale. 
* **Limited Information:**  While the overall odds are still against you (66.67% chance of low quality), the fact that Alice is recommending this specific product makes it a gamble worth taking."
