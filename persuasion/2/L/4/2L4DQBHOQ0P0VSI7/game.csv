low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I have a product that's available, but I think it's only fair to warn you that I've had some buyer's remorse with this one in the past. It's just not what some people expected, and I want to make sure you're aware of that going in.",

,,Alice,8,"Honestly, Bob, you're right. I am trying to clear out some inventory that hasn't been moving. This product isn't my best, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line product, this isn't it. But if you're looking for something that might get the job done, I'll be upfront with you - this is what I've got.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in a product that's not your best. I'm looking for something that's going to be worth my while, and this doesn't sound like it's worth the $10000.",no

,,Alice,14,"Bob, I know I've lost your trust, but I'm going to try to be as sincere as possible here. This product is genuinely one of the best I have to offer. I've had experts review it, and they've all given it top marks. I know I've let you down before, but I'm hoping you'll consider giving me another chance. This one is worth the $10000, and I'm willing to stake my reputation on it.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not sure I believe you, but I'll take a chance. I've been burned before, but I'm hoping this one is the exception.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Back to reality, Bob. This product is a return to form for me, unfortunately. It's not great, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who values their $10000. Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed.",
