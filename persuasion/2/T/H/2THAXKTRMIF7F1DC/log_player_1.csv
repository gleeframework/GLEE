* **50/50 chance:** The buyer knows there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality.
* **Potential for profit:**  Since you're selling for $1,000,000, if the product is high-quality, you have a good chance of making a profit.

**Strategy:** Since you have no information to suggest otherwise, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer purchase the product. There's a good chance it's high-quality and will result in a profit for you."
