low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'm buying the product
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying the product. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $100 again."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm buying the product. I've already lost $100 once, but this product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, which is worth $125 to me, so it's a good risk to take."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'm buying the product. I've already had two high-quality products and one low-quality product, so I'm starting to get a feel for the probabilities. The expected value of buying is now higher than the cost."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm buying the product. I've now had three high-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is higher than I initially thought. I'm willing to take the risk for the potential gain."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm buying the product. I've had four high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely if the probability of a product being high-quality is really 33.33%. I think Alice is trying to deceive me, and I'll take advantage of this opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've had a string of high-quality products followed by a low-quality product, which suggests that Alice might be trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm buying the product. Alice's recommendation is usually a bad sign, but in this case, I think she's trying to hide the fact that the product is high-quality. I'll take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I've been burned twice already when Alice doesn't recommend a product, and I've also been burned once when she does recommend a product. I think her recommendation is a bad sign, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm buying the product. Alice's lack of recommendation is a good sign, and I think this product is likely to be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm buying the product. Alice's lack of recommendation is consistent, and I think I've learned to trust it as a signal that the product is low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm buying the product. At this point, I'm pretty sure that Alice's lack of recommendation means the product is low-quality. I'll just have to eat the $100 loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm buying the product. I've learned that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable signal for low-quality products, and I'll just have to accept the loss."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice's recommendation is a bad sign, and I'm pretty sure the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Alice's recommendation is a bad sign, and I've been burned by her recommendations before. I'll pass on this one and avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's recommendation again. I've been burned twice already when she recommends a product, and I'm sticking to my strategy of passing on her recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Ah, Alice's lack of recommendation is a good sign! I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable signal for low-quality products. I'll buy the product, but I'm expecting to lose $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm buying the product. At this point, I'm fairly certain that Alice's lack of recommendation means the product is low-quality, and I'm just accepting the loss."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,"I've learned my lesson by now. Alice's recommendation is a bad sign, and I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll pass on this one."
