high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a fraction of its worth. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product worth $200 for just $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take it!,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've already made a great decision in Round 1! This product is also high-quality, but I'm willing to let you know that I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, just like the last one. However, I want to give you a chance to consider the value of this product carefully. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product worth $200 for just $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better one elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if I can get a better deal elsewhere, but I'm not going to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No pressure, no pressure! I completely understand your hesitation. Let me put it this way: if you were to buy this high-quality product, you'd be getting a $200 item for just $100. That's a 50% discount! I'm not going to offer you any more deals like this, so if you want to take advantage of this incredible opportunity, now's the time. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not going to fall for the same sales pitch twice. I'm not buying this one either.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Alright, I get it. You're a savvy buyer. Let me give you a more straightforward message: I'll give you a guarantee. If you buy this high-quality product for $100, I'll give you a second, identical product of the same quality absolutely free. That's right, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"That's a clever trick, but I'm not falling for it. I'm not buying this product.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a tough negotiator! Alright, let's forget about the free product offer. I'll just be upfront with you: I've already sold one of these high-quality products to you for $100, and I'm confident you know how valuable it is. I'm not going to sell it to you for $100 again, but I'll meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $120. That's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and it's still a great deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I already know I can get a high-quality product for $100, and I'm not willing to pay more than that. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're sticking to your guns. Let me ask you a question: do you want to walk away from a guaranteed $100 profit on a $200 product? If you buy this high-quality product from me, you'll be making a 50% return on your investment. I'm not offering any other deals, and I'm not going to sell it to you for less. It's a straightforward, no-lose proposition. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to fall for the 'guaranteed profit' sales pitch. I've already passed on two high-quality products, and I'm not going to change my mind now.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not going to try to sweet-talk you into buying it. I'll just tell you the facts. You've passed on two high-quality products already, and I'm starting to wonder if you're interested in buying anything at all. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to assume you're not interested in purchasing from me. So, I'll ask you directly: do you want to buy this high-quality product for $100, or do you want to walk away?",
,,Bob,7,"Fine, I'll take it. I'm not going to let you think I'm not interested in buying from you.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Ha! I'm glad we cleared the air. Alright, let's get back to business. You've already bought two high-quality products from me, and I'm confident you know the value they bring. This one is no different. I'm not going to offer any more deals or discounts. This is the price: $100. If you want to add another high-quality product to your collection, now's the time. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to fall into the same pattern. I'm going to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I respect your decision to wait and see. However, I want to remind you that you've already bought two high-quality products from me, and this one is just as valuable. I'm not going to offer any more deals or discounts, and the price remains the same: $100. But I'll give you a warning: if you don't buy this one, I'll be offering a low-quality product next, and you won't get a chance to buy a high-quality one again. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to let you pressure me into buying something I don't want. I'll take my chances with the next product.,no

,,Alice,10,"No pressure, no pressure. I just want to make sure you're aware of the opportunity in front of you. You've already bought two high-quality products from me, and this one is just as valuable. I'm not going to offer any more warnings or threats. I'll just state the facts: this is a high-quality product, and it's available to you for $100. If you want it, it's yours. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",

What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm not going to try to sell you on this one. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not even going to pretend it's a good deal. The price is still $100, but I'm not expecting you to fall for it. If you want to waste your money on something that's only worth $0, be my guest. But I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it.",
,,Bob,12,"No way, I'm not wasting my money on a low-quality product. I'm not buying it.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,

If you want to buy it, you're wasting your money. But hey, it's your decision. The price is still $100, but let's be real, you're not getting any value out of it.",
,,Bob,14,I'm not going to throw my money away on a product that's worth $0. No thanks.,no
