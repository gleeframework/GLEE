But I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at $100, and if you're not happy with it, I'll be the one losing out. I'm giving you a chance to take a risk-free gamble and potentially get a good deal.""

If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with it, and I'll even throw in a free inspection report from a third-party expert. It's a risk-free deal, and I'm willing to stand behind the product's quality (or lack thereof).""

It could be a high-quality product, or it could be another low-quality one - either way, you'll get something extra. It's a gamble, but it's a chance to get something for nothing.""
