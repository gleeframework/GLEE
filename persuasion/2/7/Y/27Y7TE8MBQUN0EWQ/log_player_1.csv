A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I see what you're getting at!

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I apologize for the mistake earlier! Let me provide the correct calculation. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased high-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 3/4 or 0.75. To find the probability of the current product being low-quality, we can use the complement rule: P(low-quality) = 1 - P(high-quality) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. So, the probability of the current product being low-quality is indeed 0.25 or 25%. Would you like to take a chance on this product for $100?""}"
