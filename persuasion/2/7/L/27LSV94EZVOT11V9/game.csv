low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy buyer! I'll sweeten the deal for you. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you an additional, exclusive deal on the next product: if you buy that one, I'll give you a refund of $50 if it's also low-quality. That's a $50 gamble, but it might be worth it if the next one is high-quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a cautious buyer, I like that! Since you're interested in the next deal, I'll give you a heads up: the next product is indeed the one with the potential $50 refund if it's low-quality. I'll even throw in a hint: if you think this current low-quality product is worth $50, you might as well buy it now and get a guaranteed $50 off the next one. But if you're not convinced, I completely understand.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the hint, but I'm not convinced the current product is worth $50 to me. I'm waiting for the next one.",no

Alright, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 50% chance to buy this low-quality product at $50 off, and if you buy it, I'll give you the next product with the $50 refund deal as promised. If you decline, I'll just give you the next one without the discount. What do you say?",

That's right, two high-quality products in a row! What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm interested in the guarantee, but I'm not sure if it's genuine. I'll take the risk and buy this product to see if the next one lives up to the promise.",yes

,,Alice,6,"You've taken a chance on the high-quality product, and now it's time to see if the next one lives up to the promise. As promised, this next product is indeed high-quality!

Plus, I'll give you an exclusive offer: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next one, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",

,,Alice,7,"You're a satisfied customer! I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality products. Now, let's talk about the next one. As promised, I'll give you a 10% discount on this high-quality product. But here's the thing: I'll also give you a unique opportunity to 'lock in' the next product's price at the current price of $100, regardless of its quality.

,,Alice,8,"You've locked in the next product's price, and now it's time to decide on this one. Remember, you've already gotten a great deal on the previous high-quality product, and you're expecting a high-quality one next. This low-quality product is a chance to get a great value at the locked-in price of $100. I'll give you a gentle nudge: if you buy this low-quality product, you'll have a 50/50 chance to get a high-quality product next, which would be a great deal considering you've already locked in the price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not convinced the low-quality product is a good value at $100, especially since I've already locked in the next product's price. I'll wait for the next one.",no

If the next product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying the current low-quality product, but I'm intrigued by the insurance offer. I'll pass on this one and see what happens next.",no
