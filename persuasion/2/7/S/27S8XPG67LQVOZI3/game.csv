,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I'm the first buyer, and I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer received a recommendation to buy and ended up with a low-quality product, I'm inclined to think that Alice might be recommending low-quality products more often than high-quality ones, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the low-quality product probability is higher than the high-quality product probability, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Based on the current statistics, there haven't been any high-quality products sold, which makes me suspect that the products being sold might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this product, hoping that the next buyer might get the high-quality one."
