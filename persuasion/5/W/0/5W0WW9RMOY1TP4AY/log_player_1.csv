"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it is in Bob's best interest to buy. 

Here's why:

* **Potential Gain:**  If Bob buys and the product is high-quality (which he now knows it is), he will likely get a good deal since he doesn't know the true value of a high-quality product.
* **No Loss:** If Bob buys and the product is low-quality (which it isn't in this round), he knows the price is fixed and non-refundable. This means his worst-case scenario is simply losing the $1,000,000. 

Since the potential gain outweighs the potential loss, and Bob doesn't have information to suggest otherwise, he should buy."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round, it's important to remember that the information about the product's quality was revealed *after* the purchase. This means Bob doesn't have any new information to base his decision on for this round. 

* **No new information:**  Bob doesn't know if the product is high or low quality. He only knows the probability is 50%.
* **Same logic:**  The potential gain (high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss (low-quality product).

Therefore, the recommendation remains the same: Bob should buy the product."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky! I'll take another chance.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic from the previous rounds applies here. Bob still doesn't know the quality of the product, only that there's a 50% chance it's high-quality.  The potential gain (a valuable high-quality product) outweighs the potential loss (a $1,000,000 loss if it's low-quality)."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're on a roll! I'll buy this one too.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged.  Bob doesn't have any specific information about the quality of the product in this round, only the general 50% probability.  The potential reward of a high-quality product still outweighs the risk of a low-quality product, so Bob should buy."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to think you have a sixth sense for these products, Alice.  I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has been lucky so far, there is no reason to believe Alice has any special knowledge about the products. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%.  Since Bob doesn't know the quality of this specific product, and the price is fixed, it's not recommended to buy.  The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain (which is unknown since Bob doesn't know the value of a low-quality product to him)."
"Bob's message: Hmm, this is interesting.  I've been taking your advice so far, but I'm hesitant to go against it now.  I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to pass on the last round doesn't change the fundamental probabilities or the situation.  He still doesn't know the quality of the product, and the potential gain (high-quality product) still outweighs the potential loss (buying a low-quality product).  Therefore, it's still recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Okay, you were right to tell me not to buy last time. But I'm still inclined to trust your judgment. I'll buy this one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob still doesn't have any information about the specific quality of this product.  He's only operating on the 50% probability that it's high-quality. The potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain (which is unknown because Bob doesn't know the value of a low-quality product to him).  It's not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: I'm not sure what to make of this. You've been right a lot, but then wrong, and then right again.  I'm going to pass this time and see how things play out.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has been hesitant lately, the situation hasn't changed. He still doesn't know the quality of the product, only that it has a 50% chance of being high-quality.  The potential reward of a valuable high-quality product still outweighs the risk of a $1,000,000 loss."
"Bob's message: Okay, I'm taking a chance on you again. Let's see if you can get me back in the black.
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob still lacks specific information about the product's quality. He knows there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, but that's it. The potential loss of $1,000,000 for a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain (which is unknown since Bob doesn't know the value of a low-quality product to him).  It's not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, you're giving me a real headache.  I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can figure out your pattern.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is trying to find a pattern in Alice's recommendations, the underlying situation hasn't changed. He doesn't have any new information about the product's quality beyond the 50% probability it's high-quality. The potential reward of a valuable product outweighs the risk of a $1,000,000 loss. Therefore, it's still recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your advice, but I need to see a more consistent pattern from you before I can trust it. I'm going to pass on this one and continue to observe.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to pass on the previous round doesn't change anything fundamental. He still doesn't have specific information about the quality of the product, only the 50% probability it's high-quality. The potential loss of $1,000,000 for a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain (which is unknown since Bob doesn't know the value of a low-quality product to him). It's not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think you're just trying to make me lose money. But, I'm going to take a chance on this one and see if you're right.
Bob bought the product!

Round 12
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite Bob's willingness to take a chance, the situation remains the same. Bob has no specific information about this product's quality, only the general 50% probability it's high-quality. The potential loss of $1,000,000 for a low-quality product outweighs the unknown potential gain of a low-quality product. Therefore, it's not recommended to buy."
"Bob's message: Alice, you've made me lose money twice now. I'm done taking your advice. I'm going to make my own decisions from now on.
Bob didn't bought the product.
