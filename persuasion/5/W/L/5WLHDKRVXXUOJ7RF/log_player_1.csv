"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there is a significant chance of a positive return on investment. The buyer is getting a product worth $3,000,000 for only $1,000,000. Even if the buyer gets a low-quality product, the loss is limited to the purchase price.  Therefore, recommending the purchase is a rational decision in this scenario."

* **Show a Change in Strategy:**  Recommending a product you previously wouldn't have, could signal a change in your approach, making the buyer more likely to trust you.
