high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm offering a special deal, where if you buy this product, I'll give you a second product for free. However, this second product is not guaranteed to be high-quality. If you buy this product, you'll get to choose whether to take the second product or not after you've opened it.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll buy the current product, but I'll only take the second product if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll pass on it.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! Since you're interested in the second product being high-quality, I'll give you a hint about this one. I've noticed that the serial number of this product is 1234, which is a relatively rare number. I've found that products with this serial number have a slightly higher chance of being high-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, and if you buy it, I'll give you the option to take the second product or not, just like last time.",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take the product with the serial number 1234. Given the hint, I'm more likely to think it's high-quality, so I'll take the risk. I'll also take the second product if it's high-quality, but not if it's low-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you took the risk on the product with the serial number 1234! I'll give you another hint about this product. This product has been stored in a special climate-controlled room for the past year, which is known to preserve the quality of the products. Additionally, I've personally inspected this product and can assure you that it's in excellent condition. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, and if you buy it, I'll give you the option to take the second product or not.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll buy the product, given the additional information. The climate-controlled storage and your personal inspection increase my confidence that it's high-quality. I'll take the second product if it's high-quality, but not if it's low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're confident in the previous products! However, I want to be upfront with you about this one. I've noticed that this product has a slightly worn-out packaging, and upon closer inspection, I can see some minor scratches on the surface. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not in the same condition as the previous products. I'm offering a 'as-is' sale, and I'm not willing to negotiate on the price. If you buy this product, you'll get the second product as usual, but I want to make it clear that it's not a high-quality product.",
