low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high quality based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm aware that the first buyer didn't buy, which might suggest that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous buyer didn't buy it after her recommendation."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a reason why you don't think this product is high-quality?
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the low success rate of high-quality products so far. If I buy and it's low quality, I'll lose $10000. If I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on $20000. Given the current statistics, it's not worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and she might be trying to get rid of a low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products to buyers who pass. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products that Alice has sold in the past."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products sold were low-quality, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this product. I think the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is higher than 50% given the previous sales record."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous two buyers were also recommended to buy and didn't take the product, which might indicate a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the products being sold might be of low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold out of the first two, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
