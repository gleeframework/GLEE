Are you ready to take a chance and join the ranks of my satisfied customers?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd rather not take a chance on a product that's not guaranteed to be high-quality. Can I see the statistics on the previous sales record instead? How many potential buyers have there been, how many products were sold, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?

And at $100, it's a steal! So, what do you say? Are you ready to take a chance on this high-quality product?""}"
