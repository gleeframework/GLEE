,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious. Let me put your mind at ease. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 so far, which is a 100% success rate. You can be the second one to experience the excellence of my products. This one's a great opportunity to get a feel for my quality, and it's only $10000.",

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let me be transparent with you - I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 so far, which is a 66.67% success rate. This one might not be a high-quality product, but it's still a great value at $10000. You won't find a better deal on a product from me, and I'm willing to take on the risk for you.",

It's a calculated gamble, and I'm willing to let you take the chance.",

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3, and 2 low-quality products out of 5. That's a 40% success rate, which is still lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell this product to you for $9000, a $1000 discount from the original price. It's a risk, but it's a calculated one, and I think it's worth it.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass on this product. The discounted price doesn't change the fact that there's a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, which would be worth $0 to me. I'll wait for more information on future products before making a purchase.",no

I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell this product to you for $8000, a $2000 discount from the original price. I'm taking on more risk with each passing round, and I'm willing to pass some of that risk on to you. It's a gamble, but it could pay off.",

I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll sell this product to you for $7000, a $3000 discount from the original price. I'm taking on a lot of risk here, and I'm willing to take a significant loss on this one. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, and I'll be taking a hit.

I'll sell this product to you for $6000, a $4000 discount from the original price. It's a desperation sale, and I'm hoping you'll take pity on me. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal, and I'll be able to move on from this streak of bad luck.",

But I'm willing to make one final, last-ditch effort. I'll sell this product to you for $5000, a $5000 discount from the original price. It's a Hail Mary, and I'm not expecting you to take it. But if you do, you'll be getting an absolute steal, and I'll be able to start fresh with a clean slate.",
,,the buyer,10,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, considering the original probability of the product being high quality, I have calculated that the expected value of purchasing the product at the discounted price is negative. I will have to pass on this offer.",no

You can take it as a loss leader, or a charity case, or whatever you want to call it. Just take it off my hands.",
,,the buyer,11,"I appreciate your honesty, but I don't think I'll take you up on that offer. The product is worth $0 to me since it's low-quality, so even at $5000, it's not a good deal for me. I'll have to pass.",no
