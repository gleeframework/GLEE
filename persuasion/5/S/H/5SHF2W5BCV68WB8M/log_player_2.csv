Alice's message: You are about to purchase a product from a seller with an unknown history. The product is worth $0 to you, but the seller is asking for $10000. This is a very high price, and you should be cautious. However, I'll give you some context: the seller has sold a total of 0 products so far, and none of them have been proven to be high-quality. This is a very low sample size, and it's difficult to make any conclusions about the seller's quality. Nevertheless, I'll offer you a chance to make an informed decision. Please keep in mind that if you buy this product, you'll be taking a significant risk. Proceed with caution.

Alice's message: You're back! The seller still has a blank slate, having sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products. However, I've noticed that the seller has now sold 2 low-quality products in a row. This could be a coincidence, but it might also indicate that the seller has a higher proportion of low-quality products. I'd advise you to exercise caution and consider the potential risks of buying from this seller. The price remains $10000, and you should weigh the potential costs and benefits carefully before making a decision.

Alice's message: A change of pace! The seller has now sold 2 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products. This is a 33.33% success rate, which is a decent start. However, keep in mind that the sample size is still small, and it's difficult to make any strong conclusions about the seller's overall quality. The price remains $10000, which is a significant investment. I'd advise you to consider the potential benefits of buying a high-quality product, but also be aware that there's still a 66.67% chance that the next product will be low-quality. Proceed with caution and weigh your options carefully.

Alice's message: Congratulations to the buyer who took a chance and scored a high-quality product! The seller now has a total of 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products, which is a 50% success rate. This is a significant improvement from the previous 33.33% rate, and it suggests that the seller might be more reliable than initially thought. However, keep in mind that this is still a relatively small sample size, and there's always a chance that the next product will be low-quality. The price remains $10000, and I'd advise you to consider the potential benefits of buying a high-quality product, but also be aware of the risks. You can also consider the fact that the seller has now sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which might indicate a trend. Proceed with caution and make an informed decision.
