,,Alice,6,"I appreciate your diligence in considering the probability of a low-quality product. However, I'd like to point out that our overall success rate is still 3 out of 5 products sold, which is 60%. While it's true that the probability of a low-quality product is still 50%, the fact that we've had a higher number of low-quality products sold than high-quality ones in the last two rounds suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%. I'm offering you a chance to purchase a product for $10000, but I want to be transparent with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%.
