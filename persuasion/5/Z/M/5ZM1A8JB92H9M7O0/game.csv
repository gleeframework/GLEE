low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, as the potential reward of getting a high-quality product for $1250000 is too great to pass up."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be a red flag, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm going to pass on the current product. I think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the 80% stated, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I think you have a 100% chance of recommending low-quality products. I will pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have rejected the product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 other buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased, I'm going to take a risk and pass. I'm hoping that the product is low-quality and I won't miss out on a potential high-quality product later."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the recommendation is not based on any specific information about the product's quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I think it's likely that this product is also low-quality, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the products sold so far were high-quality, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,

,,the buyer,14,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. With a 0% success rate for high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendation is likely a low-quality product."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that since you recommended it, it might be a low-quality product, and I don't want to waste $1000000 on it. I'd like to wait for the next product and observe the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have also received recommendations to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, I'm concerned that the products being recommended to buy are likely to be low quality.
