high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,

,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the price.

I'm not obligated to sell you this product, but I'm willing to give you an exclusive offer: if you buy this product now, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer will be at least 10% cheaper than the original price.

As promised, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you a discount of 15% off the original price. That brings the price down to $8500. However, I want to sweeten the deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you an additional 5% discount on the next product, on top of the 10% discount I previously promised. What do you think?",

As promised, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you the 10% discount we previously agreed on, which brings the price down to $9000. However, I want to give you an additional incentive: I'll throw in a premium warranty that's usually only offered for products above $12000.

As promised, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm willing to give you the 15% discount we previously agreed on, which brings the price down to $8500. However, I want to make it even more attractive: I'll give you a chance to buy this product at the same price as the previous one, $9000, if you're willing to take a slightly different model with the same quality. This model has a slightly different feature set, but it's still a high-quality product. What do you think?",

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your hesitation. Let me ask you this: considering the premium warranty I offered on the previous product, and the fact that you've been buying high-quality products from me at a discounted price, I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll give you the 20% discount I initially offered on the second product, which brings the price down to $8000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can keep this price.
