,,Bob,5,"Alice, while I appreciate the money-back guarantee, it doesn't address my primary concerns.  I still need concrete evidence of the product's quality and value.

I suggest we revisit this conversation once you are able to provide more transparent and concrete details.",no

While an independent assessment could be helpful, I need to understand the product's functionality, its target market, and its potential return on investment.
