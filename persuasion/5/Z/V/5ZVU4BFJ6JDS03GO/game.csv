,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced by the statistics. Even if the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, the fact that 4 out of 5 previous products were high-quality suggests that we might be experiencing a streak of luck rather than a reliable indicator of the product's quality.

I'd like to know if I'm correct in assuming that the overall probability of 80% is still the probability of receiving a high-quality product, or if it's the probability of receiving a high-quality product given that I'm the 9th buyer.",yes
