{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take your recommendation into account, but I'll also think about the statistics. 4 out of 7 buyers have purchased high-quality products, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 4/7. However, since the probability of high-quality and low-quality products is 50% each, I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability. Let's say the probability of this product being high-quality is x. Then, the probability of this product being low-quality is 1-x. We know that 4 out of 7 buyers got high-quality products, so the probability of getting a high-quality product is 4/7. We can set up the equation: x * 7/2 = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 4/3. So, the probability of this product being high-quality is 4/3. Since this is greater than 50%, I'll take the chance and buy the product.
The buyer bought the product!
