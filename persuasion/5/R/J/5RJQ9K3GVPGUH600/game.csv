low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is not based on my valuation, so I'm making this decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to take advantage of the information that 1 out of 2 previous buyers made a purchase, which suggests that the product is more likely to be high-quality."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as I'd like to make an informed decision."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the statistics, not your recommendation. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that you've recommended against it, which might mean it's more likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product.
