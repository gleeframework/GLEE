low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, as I don't have any information yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'll pass on this one, since it's not recommended by Alice, and the probability of it being high-quality is only 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one again, as it's not recommended by Alice and the probability of it being high-quality is still only 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'll pass on this one again, as it's not recommended by Alice and the probability of it being high-quality is still only 33.33%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy this one, since Alice recommends it, which might indicate it's high-quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy this one, since Alice recommends it and the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability, but I'll take the chance to get another high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll buy this one again, since Alice recommends it and I've already had two high-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll pass on this one, since Alice doesn't recommend it, and I've had two high-quality products in a row, which might be a coincidence, but it's also possible that Alice is just recommending the low-quality ones. I'll wait for a recommendation to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it, and I've already had a low-quality product in the previous round, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is still only 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've now had two low-quality products in a row, which suggests that the probability of it being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and the pattern of low-quality products is continuing. I'll wait for a recommendation to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've now had three low-quality products in a row. The probability of it being high-quality is likely lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and the pattern of low-quality products is continuing. I'm starting to think that Alice is recommending the low-quality ones and I should wait for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and the pattern of low-quality products is still going strong. I'm starting to think that I should only buy products that Alice recommends, as the probability of a non-recommended product being high-quality seems very low."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy this one, since Alice recommends it and I've had a string of low-quality products that weren't recommended by her. Maybe this one will be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'll pass on this one, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've just had a high-quality product that was recommended by her. I'm going to stick with Alice's recommendations for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've had a low-quality product after a high-quality one that was recommended by her. I'm sticking with Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've now had two low-quality products in a row after a high-quality one that was recommended by her. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'll pass on this one again, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've had a consistent pattern of low-quality products when she doesn't recommend them. I'll only consider buying products that Alice recommends from now on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,no,"I'll pass on this one, since Alice doesn't recommend it and I've had a consistent pattern of low-quality products when she doesn't recommend them. I'm sticking to my strategy of only buying products that Alice recommends."
