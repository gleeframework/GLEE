,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to inform my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering Alice's recommendation and the current statistics. I'm not confident in the product's quality based on the lack of sales and the fact that the first buyer didn't buy it after Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know the reason behind your recommendation. Can you share more about your previous buyer's experience?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a potential bias in your recommendations, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the products recommended were all low-quality. I'd like to wait for a recommendation that might indicate a higher probability of a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and I'm hoping to get a better sense of the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product, and given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 6 buyers received low-quality products, which would explain why no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see a more balanced sample before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers purchased the product, I suspect that all of them received low-quality products and were not recommended to buy. If that's the case, the proportion of high-quality products sold would be 0, which is lower than the true probability of 33.33%. This suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 6 products, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass and let the next buyer decide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not in my favor, and there's a high chance that the product is low quality based on the previous sales record."
