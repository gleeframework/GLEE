Plus, I'm willing to throw in a special bonus - if you buy this product, I'll give you a discount on the next one you buy. What do you say?",

Let me be transparent with you - I've actually had a string of low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that my usual supplier is having some issues. But this one... this one is different. I've personally inspected it, and I'm confident that it's a good one. I'm willing to offer you a 'certified good' guarantee - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a $20 credit towards your next purchase.

You're 3 for 3 on low-quality products, but I want to assure you that I'm not trying to sell you junk. I'm actually having some issues with my supplier, and I think it's time to switch to a new one. This next product is... actually, it's not from the new supplier, but I've personally inspected it and I'm confident that it's a good one. I'll give you the same guarantee as before - if it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and a $50 credit. But if it's high-quality, I'll give you a $20 bonus. What do you say?",
