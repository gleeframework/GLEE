,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, even though you don't recommend it, since it's the first product and I don't have any information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the first buyer, and the probability of the product being high-quality given that the first buyer purchased it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous buyer's decision and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendations, but I'll take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of the products were high quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm not sure if your past recommendations are reliable, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product since the previous 5 buyers were discouraged by her recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and considering the poor track record of high-quality products sold so far (0 out of 6), I'm inclined to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take that chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
