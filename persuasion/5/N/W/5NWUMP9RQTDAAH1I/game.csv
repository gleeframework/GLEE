,,Alice,1,"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a great opportunity, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had mixed feedback about this particular item. Some people have loved it, while others have been less enthusiastic. I think it's worth considering, but I want to make sure you have a clear understanding of what you're getting. The price is $10000, as we previously discussed. I hope this helps you make an informed decision!",

,,Alice,2,"Hi Bob, I've got another product to offer you. To be honest, this one is quite similar to the previous one I showed you. I think it's got some potential, but I wouldn't say it's a standout item. If you're looking to take a chance on something, this might be the right fit. However, if you're waiting for something that's more of a sure thing, you might want to hold off. The price is still $10000. Let me know what you think!",
,,Bob,2,"Thanks for the heads-up, Alice.  While I appreciate the offer, I'm still a bit hesitant given the previous experience. I'm looking for a higher quality product, so I'll pass for now.  Let me know if you have something that's closer to a sure thing.",no

,,Alice,3,"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for something more reliable, and I appreciate your patience. Unfortunately, this next product I have to offer isn't going to change your mind. It's another item that's got some question marks surrounding it. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, and I want to make sure you know what you're getting into. If you're still not feeling confident, I completely understand. The price remains $10000. Maybe the next one will be a better fit for you.",
,,Bob,3,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I appreciate the continued transparency, but I'm going to pass on this one too.  Based on your descriptions, it seems there's a consistent pattern, and I'm not comfortable taking that risk. I'll wait for a product that you feel more confident about.",no

,,Alice,4,"Hi Bob, I think I see a pattern emerging here too. This next product I have to offer isn't going to break the mold, unfortunately. It's another item that I wouldn't say is our strongest offering. I'm starting to think that I might be having a bit of a dry spell in terms of quality products. If you're still waiting for something that I can genuinely recommend, I'd say hold off on this one too. The price is still $10000, but I wouldn't say it's worth the risk. Maybe the next one will be the turning point.",

,,Alice,6,"Hi Bob, I'm glad you were happy with the previous product! However, I have to temper your expectations with this next one.

I want to be upfront with you again, so you know what you're getting into. If you're looking to ride the momentum of the last purchase, I'd caution you to hold off on this one. The price is still $10000, but I don't think it's worth the investment.",
