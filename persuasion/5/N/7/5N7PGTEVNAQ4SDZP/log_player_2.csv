Alice's message: You're in luck! I have a rare opportunity to offer you a one-of-a-kind product that's sure to impress. With only 1 out of 2 products being high-quality, this could be your chance to own a premium item. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. It's a steal! What do you say? Will you take a chance on this exclusive offer?

Alice's message: Welcome! You're the second buyer to arrive, and I'm glad to see you're interested in this unique opportunity. Since you're aware that the first buyer got lucky, you might be wondering if you'll have the same fortune. I'll let you in on a secret: the first buyer didn't know what they were getting themselves into. Now that you're aware of the 50/50 chance, are you willing to take a calculated risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000?

Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, but I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Since you're aware of the 50/50 chance, you might be thinking that the high-quality products are worth more than the low-quality ones. But what if I told you that the average value of the high-quality products is actually higher than the average value of the low-quality ones? Would that change your decision? I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that the value you'll get out of it will be worth it. What do you think?

You, on the other hand, have the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of the 50/50 chance. With that in mind, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000.
