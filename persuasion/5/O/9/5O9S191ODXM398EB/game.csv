,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on your previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like there's a higher chance of the product being low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases?"
