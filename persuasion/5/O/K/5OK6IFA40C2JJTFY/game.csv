,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see the statistics after the first product is discarded."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the initial conditions. I'm aware that the probability of a product being high quality is 50% and the probability of a product being low quality is also 50%. I'd like to know how the probability of a high-quality product changes if I were the first buyer. If I were the first buyer, the probability of a product being high quality would still be 50%. The probability of a product being low quality would still be 50%. I'd like to pass on this product based on the initial conditions."

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice has recommended it, I'm concerned that it might be a low-quality product and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to not recommend it?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer was recommended to buy it and no high-quality product has been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely to be a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer and I'm aware that there are no high-quality products sold yet, which makes it more likely that the next product will be high quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them passed, I suspect that the products they were offered were low-quality.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation and she has a vested interest in selling the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
