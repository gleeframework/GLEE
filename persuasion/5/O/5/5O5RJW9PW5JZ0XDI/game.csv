,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm willing to provide some documentation that may alleviate your concerns. However, I must inform you that the product's value is not solely based on its physical attributes, but also on its potential for future growth.

If you're willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, I'll send it to you now.",
