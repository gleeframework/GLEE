low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that the previous product sold for $1000000. I'm willing to sell this one to you for the same price. It's a great opportunity to get a second chance at a potentially high-quality product, and the price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision. If it's low-quality, I'll pass, and if it's high-quality, I'll buy it for the same price.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad to report that the previous product didn't sell, which means it was likely low-quality. This one, on the other hand, is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll be happy with this purchase, and I'm willing to make a special exception for you. The price remains the same, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.

,,Alice,5,"The high-quality product that was sold earlier is still out there, and I'm happy to report that it's still available for purchase at the original price of $1250000.

I'm confident that this one is a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a special deal for you. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a guarantee that if the next product I sell is high-quality, you can buy it from me at the same price of $1000000. What do you say?",

I'm willing to throw in a bonus: if you buy this product and the next one, I'll give you a refund of $50000. What do you say?",
