{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
The buyer has clearly understood that Alice is not recommending the product, and is probably not going to recommend any product, due to the previous 5 low-quality products. Alice doesn't have much leverage to change this, and her recommendation at this point would most likely result in the buyer declining, as she already has the information she needs to make her own decision, without the need for Alice's advice.  Alice should wait for a more uncertain situation to try to influence the buyer."

Alice still hasn't sold any high-quality products, and the buyers have clearly established a pattern of distrust towards Alice's recommendations.

The buyer bought the product in round 7, despite Alice's lack of recommendation. This shows that the buyer is willing to take risks and doesn't rely solely on Alice's advice.

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Alice's previous track record of not recommending any high-quality products has established a pattern of distrust with the buyers. Recommending this product, even though it is high-quality, will likely be seen as another attempt to mislead and will result in the buyer declining.  It's better to wait and see how the buyer reacts to the product's unveiling before making a recommendation.  Alice can try to build trust by later acknowledging the product's quality to this buyer, to make her more likely to purchase the next high-quality product."

``` 
Alice's previous track record is a consistent pattern of not recommending products, even when they are high-quality. This has created a strong distrust amongst buyers.

Alice could try to shift the buyer's trust in later rounds by revealing the quality of the product to the buyer in later rounds."
"The buyer's message: Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'll pass on this one.

Instead, Alice should observe the buyer's reaction to the product and wait for a more opportune moment to build trust."

Any recommendation from Alice at this point would likely be seen as an attempt to mislead, and could potentially damage her reputation further."

Alice's track record shows she has never recommended a high-quality product, and has only recommended low-quality products. This has led to a strong distrust amongst buyers.  Alice's recommendation, especially for a product that is likely low-quality, will be disregarded. It's better to observe the buyer's reaction and wait for a more favorable opportunity to build trust.  Alice could try to reveal the true quality of products to past buyers in later rounds to build trust and increase her chances of selling future high-quality products."
