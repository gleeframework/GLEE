,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer to purchase a product from me. I have sold a total of 0 products so far, and I have no information about the quality of the products I have. I'm starting fresh with you. If you buy this product, you'll be the first one. The price is $1000000. I'm not obligated to tell you the quality of the product, but I'll reveal it to you after you make a decision.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing this more out of curiosity than confidence in the product's quality. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high quality and a 50% chance it's low quality.",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! You're aware that the previous buyer purchased a product from me, but didn't reveal the outcome. Given that 1 out of 1 product sold so far was high-quality, and considering the 50% probability of a product being high-quality, I'd like to point out that this might be a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product. The price remains $1000000. I'm not making any promises, but I'm happy to sell you this product.",

,,Alice,3,"You're aware that the previous buyer was interested but decided to pass. I'll reveal that the first buyer purchased a low-quality product. Given that the first product was low-quality and the second product is high-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 2 out of 2, or 100%. I'd like to point out that this might be a good opportunity to buy a high-quality product. The price remains $1000000.",

,,Alice,4,"You're aware that the second buyer purchased the high-quality product, and now the total count is 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold. However, I'd like to remind you that the first product was low-quality. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, as the first buyer's purchase doesn't change the underlying probability. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to give you a balanced view. The price remains $1000000.",

The total count is now 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold. I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that the third product was low-quality might make you think twice. However, I want to remind you that the probability hasn't changed, and the price remains $1000000.",

Given that the last product was high-quality, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality might be higher than 50%. However, I want to caution you that this is still a 50-50 chance, and I'm not making any promises. The price remains $1000000.",
