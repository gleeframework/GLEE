,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as the statistics are neutral and I have no information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and the fact that you recommended not to buy doesn't necessarily mean the product is low quality. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't buy, and neither of the products sold were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the products offered so far were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered, hoping that it might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it, and I think it's likely to be low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of it being high-quality, not on your recommendation."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low probability of the product being high-quality, I'd rather pass on it and avoid the potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, and that 4 out of 4 previous buyers bought the product despite Alice's recommendations, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not sure if the product is high quality based on the current statistics.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Could you please provide that information?"
