,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first buyer after all!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't have enough information to justify a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendations, but I'll take a chance on this one. I'll buy it anyway."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have already been offered the product, and none of them bought a high-quality product. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to infer the probability of a high-quality product based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. This implies that the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. However, given the 50/50 chance of quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the same price of $10000. I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and a 50% chance it's low-quality, but I'd like to take that risk for the potential reward. Please confirm the sale."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
