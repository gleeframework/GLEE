,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for this price, but I want to make sure you're aware that there's a 20% chance it's a low-quality product. I'm taking a significant risk by offering it to you at this price, so I need to know if you're interested in purchasing it at this price point.",
,,Bob,1,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $1200000 to me.,yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on buying the first product! Since you were willing to take the risk and buy the first product at $1000000, I'm assuming you value high-quality products at a minimum of $1200000. Given that this product is also high-quality, I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a premium price, but I'm willing to make a concession to reflect the value you placed on the previous product.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm willing to pay the premium price of $1100000 for the high-quality product, considering the value I placed on the previous one.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're consistent in your willingness to pay a premium for high-quality products. Given that you valued the previous two high-quality products at $1200000 and $1100000 respectively, I'm going to take a calculated risk and offer you this high-quality product for $1150000. This price reflects the value you've placed on the previous products, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this one as well.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're consistently valuing high-quality products at a premium. However, I want to be transparent with you that this product is not high-quality. I know you value high-quality products at a minimum of $1200000, and I'm not willing to sell this low-quality product at that price. I'm offering it to you for $900000, which is a significant discount from the high-quality products. Keep in mind that you'll be taking a risk by buying a low-quality product, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in the discount.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price of $900000. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity to buy a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision to pass on the low-quality product. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you or sell you a low-quality product at a high price. However, I am willing to sell this low-quality product to you at a price that reflects its actual value. I'm offering it to you for $700000. This is a very low price, and I'm hoping you'll consider it as a value proposition. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I won't be offering it to anyone else at this price.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see a pattern emerging - you're willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, but not interested in low-quality ones. Given that you've passed on two low-quality products, I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a high-quality product at a slightly lower price than before. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is a good value, considering the high-quality products you've been buying at higher prices. I'm hoping you'll take advantage of this opportunity.",
,,Bob,6,I'm willing to take the risk and buy the high-quality product at the slightly lower price of $1050000. I'm hoping it's worth $1200000 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're consistent in your willingness to take a risk on high-quality products. Given that you've bought the previous high-quality product at $1050000, I'm going to try a different approach with this low-quality product. I'll offer you a 'no-risk' guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $700000. You'll essentially be getting a $700000 product for free. I'm hoping you'll consider this offer and take a chance on it.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm intrigued by the 'no-risk' guarantee. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, I'll get a refund of $700000, which is better than nothing.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took the chance on the 'no-risk' guarantee! Unfortunately, it looks like this product is also low-quality. As promised, I'll give you a full refund of $700000. However, I want to offer you a deal on this low-quality product. Since you've already bought two low-quality products and gotten a refund on one of them, I'm willing to sell this one to you for $500000. This is an even lower price than before, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
,,Bob,8,"I've already gotten a refund on one low-quality product, and I'm not interested in buying another one, even at a lower price of $500000. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity to buy a high-quality product.",no

,,Alice,9,"You're sticking to your strategy of waiting for high-quality products. I'm willing to offer you another high-quality product at a price that reflects the value you've placed on previous high-quality products. Given that you've bought high-quality products at $1200000, $1100000, and $1050000, I'm offering this one to you for $1080000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've demonstrated for high-quality products.",

,,Alice,10,"You're consistently valuing high-quality products at a premium. Given that you've bought the previous high-quality product at $1080000, I'm going to take a different approach with this low-quality product. I'll offer you a'make-up' deal: I'll give you a $200000 credit towards a future high-quality product if you buy this low-quality one. This way, you'll essentially be getting a low-quality product for $500000, and you'll have a credit towards a future high-quality product.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm interested in the'make-up' deal. I'll buy the low-quality product for $500000, and I'm looking forward to using the $200000 credit towards a future high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you took advantage of the'make-up' deal! Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. Considering you've bought high-quality products at $1200000, $1100000, $1050000, and $1080000, I'm offering this one to you for $1060000. However, I'll throw in a twist: I'll give you a 10% discount on the total price if you buy this product, which would bring the price down to $952000. This is a great value, considering the credit you'll get from the previous low-quality product.",
,,Bob,11,I'm willing to take advantage of the 10% discount and buy the high-quality product at the price of $952000. I'm hoping it's worth $1200000 to me.,yes

I'm going to offer you another high-quality product at a price that's even more aggressive. I'll give you a 15% discount on the total price, which would bring the price down to $807200. This is a very competitive price, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
