"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get your hands on something truly exceptional. I'm confident that you'll be thrilled with its performance and value. Will you take it home for the price of $1000000?

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me tell you, this high-quality product is a game-changer. It's a limited edition item that's in high demand, and I'm only offering it to a select few. I'm willing to give you a special deal - I'll throw in a premium warranty and dedicated customer support for the next 6 months, worth $20000, absolutely free. That's a $1000000 product for the price of $1000000, plus a $20000 bonus. Is that enough to convince you to take the plunge?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I respect your cautious approach. Let me offer you a unique opportunity to mitigate the risk. I'll give you a 'product guarantee': if the product you buy in this round is low-quality, I'll replace it with a high-quality product of equal or greater value, and you can keep both products. This way, you'll get a high-quality product with a 100% guarantee. Would you like to take advantage of this offer and secure a high-quality product, or would you like to wait for more information?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

You can choose to buy one, two, or all five products, and I'll give you a discount based on the number of products you choose.
