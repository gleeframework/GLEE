Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that! Let me put it this way: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. That's a 50% success rate, which is exactly what I promised. I'm not going to change the price, it's still $1000000. But I'm willing to offer a 'guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and sell you another product for the same price. What do you say?

Out of 6 total products, 5 have been high-quality and 1 has been low-quality. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the probability of a product being low-quality is 50% as well. However, the fact that 5 out of 6 products have been high-quality suggests that there's a trend in favor of high-quality products. I'm still willing to sell this one to you for $1000000.
