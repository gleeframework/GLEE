,,Alice,3,"We understand your concerns. We can assure you that our sales record is transparent. We've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far.

,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to take a chance on this product, given the promising sales record and the fact that 1 out of 2 products sold so far has been high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We're glad you're interested in our product! However, we want to be upfront with you - our sales record is now 2 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. We're offering this product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that you're not getting any new information about the product's quality beyond the overall probability.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, considering the overall probability of 50% high-quality products and the fact that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 total products.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. Given the overall probability of 50% for high-quality products, it seems we're slightly above the expected ratio. However, we want to be transparent with you - the law of large numbers is at play, and we're due for a few more low-quality products to balance it out. We're offering this high-quality product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, given the slightly above-average ratio of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the law of large numbers will hold, and this product will be high-quality as well.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products so far, which means the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 50%.

We're not trying to influence your decision, but we want to provide you with the facts. We're offering this product to you for $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've sold 3 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products so far, which means the probability of a product being high-quality remains at 50%.

We're offering this product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,7,I'd like to buy the current product. I'm willing to take a chance and hope it's high-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"We've sold 3 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. However, we want to point out that the law of large numbers is now strongly suggesting that the true probability might be slightly lower than 50%. We're offering this product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to consider the possibility that the true probability might be slightly lower than 50%, but I still think the potential reward is worth the risk.",yes

We're offering this product to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,9,I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information before making a decision.,no

,,Alice,13,"We've sold 6 high-quality products and 7 low-quality products so far. We've now had 6 high-quality products in a row, which is an extremely unlikely coincidence.
