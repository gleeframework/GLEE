low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as there is no prior data to go by, and I'm not influenced by your recommendation."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the recommendation was based on the previous buyer's decision and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low number of sales and the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'd like Alice to reveal the quality of the product after my decision"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. Alice's recommendation to pass also makes me skeptical."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%, which is the prior probability. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this product to see if the next buyer will make a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced based on the recommendation and the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I know the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I can get it for a fixed price of $100, which is less than its expected value of $100 ($300 * 0.3333)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and all of them were low-quality products. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice's recommendation is against it. This might be a sign that the product is low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk for $100."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This implies that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 33.33% chance. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0 out of 4. This means the probability of the product being high-quality is actually higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
