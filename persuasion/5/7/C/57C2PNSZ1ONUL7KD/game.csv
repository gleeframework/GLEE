,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0% success rate of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyer's product was high quality, which suggests the product may be low quality as well."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, I'm starting to suspect that the products they received were low-quality. If the first two products were low-quality, the probability of the third product being high-quality is higher than the overall 80% chance. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern continues."
