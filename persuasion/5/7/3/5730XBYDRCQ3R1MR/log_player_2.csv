**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from the previous buyer. While that's not much to go on, it's still better than nothing.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she knows the true quality, this carries some weight. Even if she were trying to trick us, there's a 50/50 chance she's telling the truth.
* **Potential Gain:**  If the product is high quality, we gain $20. If it's low quality, we lose $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain is small compared to the potential loss, but the information we have slightly leans towards the product being high quality.  

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk. We're taking a chance, hoping the recommendation and the single data point are a positive indicator.**"
