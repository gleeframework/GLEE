I'm confident that this product is worth much more than what I'm asking, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.""}"
"Bob's message: A 10% discount doesn't change the fact that I don't trust you. You've already tried to sell me a high-quality product at a low price, and now you're offering a low-quality product at a slightly lower price. I'm not falling for it.

However, I want to be upfront with you: this product is indeed low-quality, and it's not worth the $100 price tag. I'm not trying to deceive you this time. I'm offering it to you at a loss, just to get it off my hands. If you're not willing to take a chance on it, I completely understand. But if you do decide to buy it, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked, and we can both move on.""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not buying it, even with the refund offer. You're still trying to sell me a low-quality product, and I'm not going to take the bait. If you're being upfront about it being low-quality, then why are you trying to sell it to me at all?

That way, you'll get the product for $80. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, just like before. This way, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain. What do you say?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not falling for it. You're still trying to sell me a product, and now you're offering a 'guarantee' that sounds too good to be true. I'm not going to take the risk of buying a product that might be low-quality, even with a potential $20 bonus.
