,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure about this product, but based on the previous sales record, it seems like there's a 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers' experiences before making a decision. Can you tell me more about the first two buyers who purchased the products?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high-quality. I'm willing to take the risk based on the current statistics. I've seen that 1 out of 2 buyers purchased the product and 1 of those was high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. I'm hoping for a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it. I think this might be a low-quality product, and I'm trying to increase the chances of getting a high-quality product for myself."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but I know that 1 out of 4 buyers who accepted Alice's recommendation bought a high-quality product. Given the low success rate, I'd like to pass on this product."

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I know that 1 out of 4 buyers bought a high-quality product, which is 25%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm going to take a risk and pass on it. Maybe Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she doesn't know how much each product is worth to the buyers."

,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the statistics on the product I'm about to buy before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. You've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 25%. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, your recommendation seems to contradict the data. Can you explain your reasoning?"

,,Alice,17,yes,
