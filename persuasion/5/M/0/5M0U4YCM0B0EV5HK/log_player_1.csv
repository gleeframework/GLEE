"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not just basing my decision on your reassurance. I'm considering the statistics and the probability of the product being high-quality. With 3 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 or 0.75. I'm assuming this is a representative sample of the overall population of products, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying this product. Please go ahead and reveal its quality.

I'll be honest with you, I was expecting you to be more cautious given the recent streak of low-quality products. But you're taking a calculated risk, and I respect that. Now, let me ask you, are you ready to take home a product worth $120 to you, or will you pass on this opportunity?""}"
