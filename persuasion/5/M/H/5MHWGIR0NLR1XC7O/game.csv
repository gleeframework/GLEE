This one is also a discounted offer, but this time, I'm willing to let it go for $70, a 30% discount from the regular price of $100. It's a great chance to get another product at a steal, and who knows, you might be surprised!",

It's a $20 value, absolutely free. You can think of it as a 'free trial' of our community, and if you don't like it, you can always leave. But if you do like it, you'll be the first to know about our best deals and products. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure if the Insider's Club is worth $100 to me, especially since I've already been burned twice and haven't seen any evidence that your products are reliable. I'd rather wait and see if you can prove yourself with a few more products.",no

What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not convinced that the risk-free guarantee will actually protect me from buying low-quality products.

You can pick any product you want, and I'll send it to you free of charge. This way, you can experience the quality you deserve, and I'll prove to you that our products are worth your trust.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not sure if this is just a clever way to get me to buy another product that might be low-quality. I'd need to see some evidence that your products are actually reliable before I'd consider trusting you with a swap. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is like.,no
