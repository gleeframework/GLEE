,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the statistics after the first sale, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since there is no information to go by yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous buyer's experience?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered based on the statistics. Is it still 50%?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm not sure I should trust your recommendations. I'll buy the product anyway, but only because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm going to pass on this product. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, it seems unlikely that this product is high-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about the previous sales record. Can you tell me more about the products sold to the previous 3 buyers?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I'm skeptical of the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend me to buy, and given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, and that all products have a 50% chance of being high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the probability of this product being high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous buyers' purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $2000000 to me."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for a more neutral recommendation or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.
