low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"Welcome to our store! We're excited to offer you this product for $100. As you may know, our products have a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. We're confident that our high-quality products are worth the price, but we're also transparent about the possibility of receiving a low-quality product. Since you're our first customer, we're willing to give you a chance to take a calculated risk. If you're willing to take the chance, we'll offer you this product for $100. If you decline, we'll move on to the next customer. What would you like to do?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so because I'm the first customer and I want to set a baseline for the statistics. I'm not making any assumptions about the quality of the product, but I'm willing to take the risk. Please go ahead and reveal the product's quality.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Thank you for considering our product! As our second customer, you now have some valuable information about our sales record. We've sold one product so far, and it was a low-quality one. This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the probability of a low-quality product is now 33.3% (since we've already sold one low-quality product). With this new information, you can make a more informed decision. We're still offering the product for $100, and we're confident that our high-quality products are worth the price. However, we understand that you may want to take a closer look at the statistics before making a decision. What would you like to do?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, which I believe is still 50%. I'm not basing my decision on any information about the product's actual quality, but rather on the statistical probability. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as the potential reward is worth it to me.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to our store! We're glad to see you're interested in our product. As our third customer, you now have more information about our sales record.

This means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 66.7% (since we've sold one high-quality product out of two total products). We're still offering the product for $100, and we're confident that our high-quality products are worth the price. However, we also want to remind you that there's still a 33.3% chance that the product could be low-quality. With this new information, you can make an even more informed decision. What would you like to do?",
,,the buyer,3,"I would like to pass on the current product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 66.7%, but I'm still concerned that there's a 33.3% chance it could be low-quality. Given the value I place on high-quality products ($125) and the price of $100, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'd like to wait for more information or consider other options.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Thank you for considering our product! We understand your concerns about the risk of receiving a low-quality product.

With the increasing probability of receiving a high-quality product, we're hoping you'll consider giving us another chance. What would you like to do?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced that the probability of a high-quality product has increased to 75%. I'd like to know more about the previous sales.
