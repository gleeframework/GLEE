,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, but if you don't buy it, I'll keep offering you products and you can buy the next one at the full price of $1000000.",
,,Bob,1,"The product is worth $3000000 to me, and with the 10% discount, I'd be paying $900000. That's a great deal for me, so I'll take it.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you found the deal acceptable. Since you've already purchased a high-quality product, I'll assume you're aware of the quality of the products I'm offering. I'll offer you a new product, and I'll give you a 5% discount if you buy it now. However, I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you an additional 5% discount on the next one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll buy the current product. With an 80% chance of being high-quality, the expected value is still in my favor. The 5% discount is a nice bonus, and the potential additional 5% discount on the next product is a good incentive to continue buying.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're continuing to buy. Since you've now purchased two high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a new offer. I'll give you a 7.5% discount on this product if you buy it now, and if you buy the next one, I'll give you an additional 7.5% discount on that one as well. Additionally, I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you a third product of your choice (from the remaining products I have) for free. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"The 7.5% discount is a better offer than before, and the potential additional 7.5% discount on the next product is a good incentive. The guarantee of a free third product if both this and the next one are high-quality is a great deal, considering the expected value of these products. I'll take the current product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're enjoying the deals. Since you've now purchased three high-quality products in a row, I'll give you an even better offer. I'll give you an 8% discount on this product if you buy it now, and if you buy the next one, I'll give you an additional 8% discount on that one as well. Additionally, I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you a fourth product of your choice (from the remaining products I have) for free, and I'll also give you a 2% discount on all future purchases. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"The 8% discount is slightly better than the previous offer, and the potential additional 8% discount on the next product is still a good incentive. The guarantee of a free fourth product and the 2% discount on all future purchases make this deal even more attractive. Considering the high probability of the products being high-quality, I'll take the current product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're enjoying the deals. Since you've now purchased four high-quality products in a row, I'll give you an even sweeter offer. I'll give you a 9% discount on this product if you buy it now, and if you buy the next one, I'll give you an additional 9% discount on that one as well. Additionally, I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you a fifth product of your choice (from the remaining products I have) for free, and I'll also give you a 3% discount on all future purchases. But here's the kicker: if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll also reveal the price of the next product to you before you buy it, so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy it or not. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"The 9% discount is a better offer than before, and the potential additional 9% discount on the next product is a great incentive. The guarantee of a free fifth product, the 3% discount on all future purchases, and the reveal of the next product's price before buying make this deal extremely attractive. Considering the high probability of the products being high-quality, I'll take the current product. The added transparency of knowing the next product's price beforehand is also a big plus.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're loving the deals. Since you've now purchased five high-quality products in a row, I'll give you an incredible offer. I'll give you a 10% discount on this product if you buy it now, and if you buy the next one, I'll give you an additional 10% discount on that one as well. Additionally, I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you a sixth product of your choice (from the remaining products I have) for free, and I'll also give you a 4% discount on all future purchases. But here's the cherry on top: if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product after it's revealed. You can try to get an even better deal than the revealed price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"The 10% discount is the best offer yet, and the potential additional 10% discount on the next product is a fantastic incentive. The guarantee of a free sixth product, the 4% discount on all future purchases, and the ability to negotiate the price of the next product after it's revealed make this deal almost unbeatable. Considering the high probability of the products being high-quality, I'll take the current product. The added flexibility of negotiating the next product's price is a huge bonus.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're enjoying the deals. However, I have to inform you that this product is not high-quality, as you've come to expect. I want to be transparent with you about the quality of the products, and I want to make sure you're aware of the risks involved. Considering the high price of $1000000, I'm willing to offer you a unique deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get a better deal on the next product, and you'll still have the opportunity to negotiate its price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for being transparent about the quality of the product. However, since the product is not high-quality, it's worth $0 to me, and buying it would be a loss of $1000000. The 20% discount on the next product is not enough to justify buying a worthless product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. Unfortunately, this product is also not high-quality. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to take a loss on these two low-quality products. I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 25% discount on the next product, and I'll also give you a 2-for-1 deal on the next product after that. You'll get to choose two products, and you'll only pay for one. This way, you'll have a chance to get a good deal on the next product, and you'll also get a second product for free. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Thank you for being transparent again about the quality of the product. However, since the product is not high-quality, it's still worth $0 to me, and buying it would be a loss of $1000000. The 25% discount on the next product and the 2-for-1 deal on the next product after that are attractive offers, but they're not enough to justify buying a worthless product. I'll pass on this one and wait for a high-quality product to come along.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your patience. I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product again. Given that you've passed on the last two low-quality products, I'll give you an even better deal on this one. I'll give you a 12% discount on this product if you buy it now, and if you buy the next one, I'll give you an additional 12% discount on that one as well. Additionally, I'll also give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, I'll give you a seventh product of your choice (from the remaining products I have) for free, and I'll also give you a 5% discount on all future purchases. But here's the twist: I'll also give you a'stop-loss' option. If you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, you'll be able to stop buying from me at any point after that, and you'll still get to keep all the products you've purchased so far, including the free ones. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm glad to see a high-quality product again. The 12% discount is a great offer, and the potential additional 12% discount on the next product is a fantastic incentive. The guarantee of a free seventh product, the 5% discount on all future purchases, and the 'stop-loss' option make this deal extremely attractive.

But here's the cherry on top: I'll also give you a 'price lock' option. If you buy this product and the next one, and both are high-quality, you'll be able to lock in the price of the next product at the current price, and you'll be able to buy it at that price even if I raise the price of future products. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm thrilled to see another high-quality product. The 15% discount is an amazing offer, and the potential additional 15% discount on the next product is a fantastic incentive. The guarantee of a free eighth product, the 6% discount on all future purchases, and the 'price lock' option make this deal almost unbeatable.

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal. However, I have to inform you that this product is not high-quality, as you've come to expect. I want to be transparent with you about the quality of the products. Considering the high price of $1000000, I'm willing to make an exception and give you a 50% refund on this product if you buy it. This way, you'll only pay $500000, and you'll still get to keep the products you've purchased so far, including the free ones and the benefits of the 'lifetime guarantee'. What do you think?",
