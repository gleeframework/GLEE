**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The data shows that all products recommended so far have been high-quality. 
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true value of each product and has a strong incentive to recommend high-quality items to ensure buyers are satisfied and return for future purchases.

While there's always a chance the product is low-quality, the information available strongly suggests it's likely to be high-quality. The potential reward of $125 outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
