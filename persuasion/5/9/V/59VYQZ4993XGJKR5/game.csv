low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to roll the dice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you're advising me not to buy it? I'd like to make an informed decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. Can you provide me with the probability of the product being high quality based on the data?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice does not recommend it and I'm not confident in buying a product without her endorsement."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers received low-quality products, I think it's likely that the current product is also low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the statistics or something else?
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on the next product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator that it's a low-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping for a low-quality product to be sold, so the proportion of high-quality products sold will decrease and Alice will be less likely to recommend a product in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against high-quality products, and I'm trying to exploit that. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample. With only 7 buyers, the sample size is too small to accurately determine the true proportion of high-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 9 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
