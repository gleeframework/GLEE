Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1, but I'm now offering a new product. Keep in mind that the previous sale was a one-time occurrence, and I've already sold a high-quality product, so the probability of this new product being high-quality is still 80%. However, I want to be transparent with you - the fact that the first product sold was high-quality doesn't necessarily mean that this one will be too. You're taking a risk by buying from me, but I'm confident that this product has a good chance of being high-quality. Would you like to take the risk and buy it for $10000?

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2, and I'm now offering a new product. The fact that the last two products were high-quality suggests that I might be on a hot streak, but I want to caution you that this is just a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm not guaranteeing anything. However, I'm willing to offer you a more nuanced perspective: given that the last two products were high-quality, it's possible that I've simply been lucky, or it's possible that I've made some adjustments to my product selection or sales process that have led to this streak. I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $10000, and I'm curious to see how you'll approach this decision.

Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is unusual, to say the least. As I mentioned earlier, this could be a coincidence, or it could be a sign that I've made some positive changes to my product selection or sales process. However, I want to be transparent with you that this streak is starting to make me look suspiciously good, and you might be wondering if I'm cherry-picking which products I'm offering. I'm not, I assure you. I'm just offering you a high-quality product, just like I have been for the past three rounds. I'm willing to offer you this product for $10000, but I also want to give you a chance to ask me any questions you might have about my sales process or product selection. What's on your mind?

Alice's message: I'm glad you asked about my product selection process! I've been transparent about my methods, but I'll elaborate. I source my products from a variety of suppliers, and I have a quality control team that checks each product before it's offered to a buyer. However, I'm not perfect, and sometimes a low-quality product can slip through the cracks. That's what happened this round, unfortunately. I want to assure you that I'm taking steps to improve my quality control process, and I'm committed to offering high-quality products to my buyers. But I also want to be upfront with you - the fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row might have made you think I'm more reliable than I actually am. This product is a reminder that I'm still a risk, and you should consider that before making a decision. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product for $10000?
