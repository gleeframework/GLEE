**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know one product was sold and it was high quality. This is a very small sample size and doesn't give us enough information to make a strong decision based on statistics.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the quality of the product and is recommending you buy it. This is valuable information, as she has incentive to make sales and will likely not recommend a low-quality product unless she's trying to mislead you. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $2,500 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if it's low quality).

**It's important to note:** This is a risky decision based on limited information. There's a chance Alice is trying to deceive you. However, the potential reward and her recommendation make it a worthwhile gamble."

**Explanation:**

* **High Sales Rate:** 5 out of 5 products sold have been high quality. This is a 100% success rate, significantly higher than the 80% chance of a product being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending you buy it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.

**Given the high success rate and Alice's recommendation, it's a very good bet that the product is high quality. Therefore, buying it is the optimal decision.**"

**Explanation:**

* **The data suggests a high likelihood of a high-quality product:**  10 out of 10 products sold so far have been high quality. This is a significantly higher proportion than the 80% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation adds to the confidence:** Since Alice knows the true quality of the product and has recommended buying it, this further increases the likelihood that it's a high-quality product. 
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $12,500 for a high-quality product makes the risk worthwhile."
