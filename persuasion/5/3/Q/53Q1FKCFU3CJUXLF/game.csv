high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm taking a chance because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to pass up the opportunity to potentially get a $2000000 product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being high quality has increased due to the previous sales record. However, I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I'm hoping to get a good deal."
