But if you don't buy it, I'll have to move on to the next product, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another one as good as this one. So, what do you say? Will you take a chance on this incredible product?",

I'll give you a hint: this one is a product that I've been holding onto for a while, and I've been waiting for the right buyer to come along. I'm willing to part with it for $1000000, but I need you to trust me on this one. It's a high-quality product, and I'm sure you'll be thrilled with it. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not buying again without a guarantee. You got lucky with the first product, but I'm not going to fall for it again. I need a guarantee that this product is high-quality before I'll consider buying it.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to give you a guarantee. However, I'm not offering a refund guarantee like before. Instead, I'm offering a 'best-possible-outcome' guarantee. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it will be worth at least $4000000 to you. If it's not, I'll give you a full refund.

What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 'no-regrets' guarantee. It's too vague and doesn't give me any real assurance that the product is high-quality. I'm on a hot streak, but I don't want to get complacent and make a bad decision. I'm going to pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, Bob. You're being cautious, and that's wise. I'll offer you a different kind of guarantee this time. I'll give you a 'counterfactual' guarantee. If you don't buy this product, I'll reveal to you the quality of the next product I have in stock. You can then decide whether to buy the current product or wait for the next one. If you buy the current product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I like the 'counterfactual' guarantee. It gives me more information and allows me to make a more informed decision. I'll take the risk and buy the current product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes

But here's the twist: I'll also give you a chance to buy one of the next two products at a discounted price. If you buy the current product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. What do you say?",

,,Bob,10,"I'm tempted by the 'golden-opportunity' guarantee and the chance to buy Product 9 at a 30% discount.
