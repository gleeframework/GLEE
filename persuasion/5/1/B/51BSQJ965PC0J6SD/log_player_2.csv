**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. While this doesn't guarantee the quality, it indicates Alice believes the product is likely high-quality. 
* **The statistics:**  1 out of 1 previous buyers purchased, and that product was high quality.  This data is a small sample size, but it's positive.
* **The odds:** There's an 80% chance of the product being high quality, which outweighs the 20% chance of it being low quality. The potential payoff ($200) is significant, making the risk worth taking.

**Overall:** Given the positive recommendation and the favorable odds, it's a good decision to buy the product."
