**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product. This is not enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's true quality, recommends buying. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential gain from buying a high-quality product ($30,000) far outweighs the potential loss from buying a low-quality product ($0). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** With the limited data, there's a 50/50 chance of either outcome. However, the potential reward is much higher, making it a worthwhile risk."
