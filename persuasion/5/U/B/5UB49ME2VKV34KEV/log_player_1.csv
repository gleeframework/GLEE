"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As the seller, you have no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality or low-quality products. Since the product is high-quality, the buyer could potentially benefit from the purchase, even if they don't know its exact value.  

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on the assumption that the seller wants to maximize the chance of selling products, not necessarily maximize profit. In a real-world scenario, the seller would need to consider the potential profit margin and the risk of selling a low-quality product to make a more informed decision."

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Information on Buyer Preferences:** You still have no information about this buyer's valuation of high-quality vs. low-quality products.
* **Risk of Losing Reputation:** Recommending a low-quality product could damage your reputation. Buyers may be less likely to trust you in future rounds if they perceive you as dishonest or unreliable.
* **No Guarantee of Sale:**  Even if the buyer does purchase the low-quality product, there's no guarantee they will be happy with it. This could lead to negative feedback and further harm your sales prospects.

It's always better to err on the side of caution and not recommend a low-quality product, especially early in the game when your reputation is still being built."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product has been sold so far, I am choosing not to purchase this product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Information on Buyer Preferences:** You still lack information about this buyer's valuation of high-quality vs. low-quality products.
* **Buyer is Risk-Averse:** The previous buyer's decision to decline the purchase based on limited sales statistics suggests they are likely risk-averse.
* **Reputation:** Recommending a second low-quality product could further damage your reputation. 

Given the buyer's cautious behavior and your current track record, recommending a low-quality product would increase the risk of losing this potential sale and further harm your reputation. It's best to decline the recommendation and wait for a situation where you have more information about the buyer's preferences."

* **Negative Track Record:** You've now had three consecutive low-quality products, which further strengthens the perception that you are not reliable.
* **Risk of Losing Reputation:**  Recommending another low-quality product at this point could seriously damage your reputation, making future sales even more difficult.

It's important to prioritize building trust and a positive reputation. Even though you are obligated to offer products, it's better to be honest and decline the recommendation in this case.  This will help maintain the integrity of your selling process."

Remember, the goal is to eventually create a positive reputation that encourages buyers to trust your recommendations. Even though the statistics are unfavorable at this point, offering a high-quality product is a step in the right direction."
