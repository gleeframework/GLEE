,,Alice,7,"You're really building a collection of high-quality products! Since you've taken advantage of the price-matching deal and bought the last product for $80, I'm going to offer you a 'lock-in' deal. I'll sell you the next product for $80, just like the last one, and I'll also give you a guarantee that the next product after this one will be sold to you for the same price as this one, regardless of its quality. This is a great opportunity to stock up on high-quality products at a fixed price!",
