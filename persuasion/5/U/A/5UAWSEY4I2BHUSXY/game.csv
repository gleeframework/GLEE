high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't suggests that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer has a better experience."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 1 out of 1 buyer passed on the product, and the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'd like to infer the probability of it being low-quality."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%.
