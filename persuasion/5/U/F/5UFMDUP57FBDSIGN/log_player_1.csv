The same reasoning applies as in round 1. The product is low-quality, and there is still no evidence to suggest that Alice is selling high-quality products. It would be unwise to recommend the buyer purchase this product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I will pass on this product. Since no products have been sold yet, there's no information on the quality of previous products, and your recommendation is negative, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This round's product is high-quality.  Although there is no sales history yet, the buyer can now see that Alice is willing to recommend the product, and the buyer's expected value if the product is high-quality is greater than the cost. Thus, it would be rational to recommend the buyer purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.  However, with no sales history, I can't be sure of the quality of your products. I'd like to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I invest $1000000.  Let me know if you sell any products to other buyers and I'll reconsider.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Given that no products have been sold yet and you are not recommending this product, I will pass for now.  I'd like to see some sales history before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
The buyer has expressed a clear preference for seeing evidence of previous sales before purchasing. Since there is no sales history and this round's product is low-quality, it would be unwise to recommend the purchase.  It is more likely to drive away potential buyers by trying to push a low-quality product when the buyer is already hesitant."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The buyer has consistently stated they want to see evidence of successful sales before purchasing.  Since no products have been sold yet and this round's product is low-quality, it's best to not recommend it.

The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 13
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This round's product is high-quality. While the buyer has been hesitant to purchase due to the lack of sales history, this round's high-quality product coupled with your recommendation could shift the buyer's perspective.  Even though the buyer is risk-averse, the potential reward of $4,000,000 from a high-quality product is likely to outweigh the risk for a buyer who has already considered making a purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there is no prior sales data to analyze, I'm not comfortable making a purchase. I would prefer to wait and see if other buyers purchase the product and if the quality of those products is revealed. This would give me a better understanding of the overall quality of the products you offer.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

Round 16
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is a crucial round. The product is high-quality, which is a significant change from the previous rounds.  The buyer is still hesitant due to the lack of sales history, but they are now aware of the high-quality product, which offers a substantial potential return. This is the moment to press the advantage. Even though they haven't bought previously, the buyer has engaged in the conversation and shown interest.  This round, the risk-reward calculation is now in favor of the buyer. The potential for a $4,000,000 return outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000. It's time to push for a sale and build that sales history."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm not comfortable buying a product with such a high chance of being low quality without any prior information on the seller's reliability. I'd like to see some sales history before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 17
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

The buyer has been extremely hesitant due to the lack of sales history and the potential for a low-quality product.  While this round's product is low-quality, it's important to recognize the buyer's pattern.  Recommending a purchase now, despite the lack of positive sales history, will likely further discourage the buyer.  It's crucial to let the buyer see a pattern of positive sales before recommending a purchase, even if the current product is high-quality.  Continuing to push for a sale at this point is likely to lead to further rejection and harm future sales prospects.  It's better to focus on building trust and demonstrating reliability through successful sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet, I'd prefer to pass on this product. I'll observe how other buyers react before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 18
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is another crucial opportunity. The product is high-quality, and even though the buyer has shown extreme reluctance in the past, it's time to take a bold step. The buyer has expressed their need for sales history and a track record of success.  This round presents the chance to break that barrier. By confidently recommending the product, you demonstrate your belief in its quality and potentially shift the buyer's perception. The buyer has already acknowledged the potential reward of $4,000,000 and the risk of losing $1,000,000. Now is the time to capitalize on that understanding and the potential for a positive first sale."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first sale and there's no data on previous products, I'm going to trust your recommendation and buy the product. I'm hoping for the best!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 19
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is a significant moment.  The first sale has occurred, which will drastically change the perspective of future buyers. The buyer in this round, seeing that someone else has bought the product, is likely to be more receptive. The product in this round is also high-quality, increasing the potential reward. It's time to capitalize on this momentum and continue building trust and confidence. Recommending this purchase will likely lead to a sale and further establish the seller's reliability."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you have a 100% track record of selling high-quality products so far. I'm confident in your recommendation and I'll take the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

This is a great opportunity to close out strong.  The seller has a 100% track record of selling high-quality products, and the current product is also high-quality. The buyer is likely to be highly confident in the seller's reliability and will probably be more willing to take a risk given the positive track record. Recommending the purchase will almost certainly result in a sale and further solidify the seller's reputation."
