I price all products at $100, regardless of quality. Considering this, I'd like to highlight that you're more likely to get a low-quality product from me. However, if you do get a high-quality product, it's a great value for the price. You can think of it as a 33.33% chance of getting a great deal and 66.67% chance of getting a product at a fixed price. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product?

Upon re-examining the sequence H-L-L-H-L-H, I realize that I was too hasty in saying the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33%.
