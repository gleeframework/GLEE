,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as there is no prior data to go off of, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that you didn't recommend it suggests that it might be low-quality. I'm taking a risk, but I'm willing to take it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced it's worth the $100 given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm inclined to believe that the products being sold are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be high quality since the first two buyers didn't buy and she didn't recommend it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product being offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the previous 4 buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy, and since you're not recommending it, I'm inclined to think it might be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the previous buyers' experience. I'd like to pass and see what happens next.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is significantly lower than the expected 1/3. Given the low quality of the products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous 4 buyers have all been recommended to buy and none of them have found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it less likely that the current product is high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations.
