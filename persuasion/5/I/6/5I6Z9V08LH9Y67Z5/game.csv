low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I don't have any information about the product's quality yet."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 product sold, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is very low. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to know the quality of the product, but I'm not confident enough to buy it based on your previous sales record and recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which makes me think it's likely low quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still high, and I might get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or the product's quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I don't want to buy the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality, considering the current statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on the recommendation, since no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product, and I'd like to see the statistics on the previous sales record to help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending me to buy the product, and what the statistics are so far. I'd also like to know what the probability of a high-quality product being sold is based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware of the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be higher than the 33.33% chance. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous sales record. With 4 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, I'd like to know the probability that a product is low-quality, which is 4/4 or 1. However, I also want to know the probability that a product is high-quality, which is 0/4 or 0. Given these probabilities, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low-quality and I'm going to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for the next one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also chosen not to buy after your recommendations, and considering the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 4 previous buyers not purchasing any high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall average.
