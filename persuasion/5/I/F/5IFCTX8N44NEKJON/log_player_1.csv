"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a reduced price. The fact that you're willing to discount it so heavily suggests that you're not confident in its quality either. I've seen five low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that it's not worth my time to continue considering your offers.
