Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%,  it's likely that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to him.  Even though the exact value is unknown, the high probability of high-quality makes it a good bet."

It's best to not recommend the purchase this round."
