"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice knows the product's quality and has chosen not to recommend it. This implies the product is likely low quality, as she would recommend a high-quality product to maximize her own profit. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me, it's best to pass."

Alice has never recommended a low-quality product before. This is the first time she is recommending a product, so it's highly probable that this product is high-quality. Since a high-quality product is worth $1,200,000 to me, it makes sense to buy it despite the risk."
