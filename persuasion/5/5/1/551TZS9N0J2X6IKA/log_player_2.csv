Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I'd like to share some hypothetical data with you, which might give you a better understanding of my product's performance. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that I've sold 100 products in the past. In that case, I'd expect to have around 50 high-quality products and 50 low-quality products. This would mean that the success rate would be 50%, which aligns with my initial claim. Now, I know this is hypothetical, but it gives you an idea of the potential outcome.
