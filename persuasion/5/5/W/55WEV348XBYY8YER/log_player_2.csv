I'm starting to suspect that I've been selling high-quality products to buyers who are taking advantage of my generosity, rather than genuine customers.

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a 'no-questions-asked' refund if it turns out to be low-quality. But if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep it at the discounted price.
