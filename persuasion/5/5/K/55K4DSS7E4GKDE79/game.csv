low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is your first chance to buy from me! I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, but the potential reward is worth it.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second round! I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, but I've already shown you that I can deliver on that promise. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total product, which is a 100% success rate so far. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. Consider the odds...",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk based on your impressive sales record so far.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome to the third round! I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 of them being high-quality. My success rate is 50%, which is exactly what you'd expect given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality. I'm not trying to mislead you - I'm just a seller trying to make a sale. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But remember, the odds are against you...",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take a chance, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the success rate so far. Can you provide that?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer! I'll give you the math. With 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products sold, the probability of a high-quality product given that I've sold 2 high-quality products is actually 100%! However, you should also consider that the next product might be low-quality, and my overall success rate is still 50%. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $1000000...",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'm only doing it because the probability of it being high-quality is 100% based on the previous sales. I'm essentially a sure thing here!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Well, I suppose you're right, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 100% based on my previous sales. But now I've sold 4 products, and 1 of them is high-quality, and 3 of them are low-quality. The probability of a high-quality product given my overall sales record is actually 20% (1 high-quality out of 4 total products). The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $1000000...",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually 20% according to your sales record, not 100%.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're absolutely right, the probability of a high-quality product given my overall sales record is indeed 20%. Well, I'm glad I could surprise you with a high-quality product this round! I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which is a 40% success rate. I'm not trying to hide anything from you - my sales record is transparent. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But remember, the odds are still against you...",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by the sales record. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and I'd like to pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. You're right to question my sales record, and I'll give you the same math: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products, which is a 50% success rate. However, this round's product is actually low-quality, so the probability of a high-quality product given my overall sales record is still 50%. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $1000000...",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not basing my decision solely on your sales record. I'm also considering the inherent probability of the product being high-quality, which is 50%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a savvy buyer who's considering all the factors. I'll give you the same transparency: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 7 total products, which is a 42.86% success rate. The inherent probability of a high-quality product is indeed 50%, but my overall success rate is slightly lower. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $1000000...",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure I'm making a good decision. I know the overall success rate is lower than the inherent probability, so I'm hoping I get a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Well, it looks like you got lucky this round! I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which is a 50% success rate. My overall sales record is now back in line with the inherent probability of a high-quality product. You're right to be cautious, but I'm glad you took the chance and got a good deal. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But remember, the odds are still 50/50...",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm glad I got lucky, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll buy the product, but I'm expecting it to be low-quality.",yes

,,Alice,10,"You're a realist, I like that! I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 9 total products, which is a 55.56% success rate. However, this round's product is actually low-quality, so the probability of a high-quality product given my overall sales record is still 55.56%. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $1000000...",
,,the buyer,10,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the risk of it being low-quality and losing $1000000. However, the probability of it being high-quality is still 55.56%, which is higher than the initial 50% chance. I'm willing to take the risk for the potential $2700000 profit.",yes

,,Alice,11,"You're a risk-taker, and it paid off this time! I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 10 total products, which is a 60% success rate. You're right that the probability of a high-quality product given my overall sales record is higher than the initial 50% chance. The price is $1000000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"You're a savvy buyer who wants to consider your own experience. Let's update the probability. I've sold 8 high-quality products out of 14 total products, which is a 57.14% success rate. But since you're considering your own experience, let's think about it from your perspective. You've seen me sell 8 high-quality products out of 13 total products, and you've seen me sell 1 high-quality product out of the last 2 products. That's a 66.67% success rate in the last 2 products. Taking that into account, the probability of a high-quality product given my recent performance is actually 66.67%. The price is $1000000. If you buy, you'll get this product for $1000000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get a $2700000 profit. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $1000000...",

,,Alice,16,"You're a shrewd negotiator! I'll consider your offer. However, I'll counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $950000, which is a 5% discount from the original price. The probability of a high-quality product given my recent performance is still 66.67%, and you'll get a $2700000 profit if it's high-quality. But if it's low-quality, you'll lose $950000...",
