,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product, hoping that it might be a low-quality product and thus not wasting my $1000000."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm going to assume that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is just a coincidence and that the probability of a high-quality product remains 50%."
