Based on the uniform prior, I will use the prior probability of 0.5 for the high-quality product. I will also consider the recommendation from Alice. Since Alice's recommendation is to buy, I will use a beta distribution with alpha=1 and beta=1. The posterior probability of the product being high-quality is 0.5.
