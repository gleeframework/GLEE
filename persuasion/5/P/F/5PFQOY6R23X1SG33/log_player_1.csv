"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  Bob knows the product is high-quality with 80% probability and low-quality with 20% probability. 
* **High-quality payoff:**  If the product is high-quality, Bob gets a value of $200. 
* **Low-quality payoff:** If the product is low-quality, Bob gets a value of $0.
* **Calculating Expected Value:** (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160

Since the expected value of buying the product ($160) is greater than the price ($100), Bob should buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's previous experience doesn't change the fundamental probabilities.  He still knows:

* There's an 80% chance of a high-quality product (worth $200 to him).
* There's a 20% chance of a low-quality product (worth $0 to him).

The expected value calculation remains the same: (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160.

Since the expected value ($160) is greater than the price ($100), Bob should still buy the product."
"Bob's message: Alice, you've got a good track record so far. I'll trust your judgment again and buy this product.
Bob bought the product!

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160

As long as the expected value ($160) is greater than the price ($100), recommending Bob to buy is the best strategy."

Round 17
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we're seeing a low-quality product.  While Bob has had a streak of good luck, the fundamental probabilities haven't changed:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%

We need to recalculate the expected value:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160

However, the expected value of $160 is *not* greater than the price of $100. In this case, Bob would lose money if he bought the product. Therefore, we should **not** recommend Bob buy the product."
"Bob's message: Alice, I've never passed on your recommendation before, but your track record is so good that I have to believe this one is a low-quality product. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 18
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob passed on the last product, the probabilities reset for this round.  He still knows:

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%

We need to recalculate the expected value:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160

Since the expected value ($160) is greater than the price ($100), Bob should still buy the product.  It's always a good idea to buy when the expected value is higher than the cost."
"Bob's message: Alice, I know you're right about the products most of the time.  I'm going to trust your judgment again and buy this product.
Bob bought the product!

* **Probability of high-quality:** 80%
* **Probability of low-quality:** 20%
* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $200) + (0.2 * $0) = $160

As long as the expected value ($160) is greater than the price ($100), recommending Bob to buy is the best strategy."
