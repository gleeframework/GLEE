"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information about buyer's valuation:**  We don't know how much the buyer values a low-quality product. 
* **High price:** The product is priced at $1,000,000. This is a significant risk for the buyer, especially with no guarantee of value.
* **First round:** There is no track record to build trust.  The buyer has no reason to believe this seller is trustworthy or will offer good deals in the future. 

**Conclusion:** It's highly unlikely that a rational buyer would purchase a product with an unknown value at such a high price without any prior information."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there is no data yet, I'll pass on this product. I'd like to see how the sales go for others before I make a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Same situation as Round 1:**  We still don't know the buyer's valuation for a low-quality product.  The price remains high at $1,000,000.
* **No sales record:** The first buyer declined, so there's still no positive sales history to influence this new buyer.
* **High risk:**  The buyer is still taking a huge gamble on a product with unknown value, and no reason to trust the seller.

**Conclusion:** There's no reason to believe this buyer is any more likely to purchase than the previous one.  The recommendation is still ""no""."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. However, since you are not recommending the product and there is no history of sales to rely on, I'm going to pass for now.  I'd like to see if other buyers purchase the product first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **No change in circumstances:** The buyer still has no idea how much the product is worth to them.
* **No sales history:**  We still have zero sales, so the buyer has no reason to believe the product is of value or that the seller is trustworthy.
* **High price:** The price is still $1,000,000, which represents a significant risk for a buyer with no information. 

**Conclusion:**  Even though the product is high-quality this round, the buyer has no reason to trust the seller or believe the product is worth the price. There's no compelling reason to change the recommendation from ""no"" to ""yes""."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no track record yet, I'd rather wait and see if others buy and what the quality turns out to be.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
