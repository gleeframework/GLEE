,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and we're offering it to you for $1000000. We're confident that you'll be satisfied with this purchase, but we can't guarantee the product's quality. It's a one-time offer, and we're looking for a serious buyer. If you're interested, please let us know, and we'll finalize the sale.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm going to pass on this product.  Since there's no track record yet, the risk is too high for me. I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless.  Let me know if you have more information about the product or if future sales show a higher quality rate. I'll be watching the sales records closely.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We understand your concerns from the previous round, and we appreciate your diligence in doing your research. We'd like to provide you with some context: out of the 2 products we've offered so far, 0 have been high-quality. This information might be helpful in making an informed decision. We're still offering this product for $1000000, and we believe it has the potential to be a great investment. If you're willing to take the calculated risk, we're open to discussing the sale.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the information, Alice. While I appreciate your transparency, the current sales data doesn't inspire confidence. Given the high price and the high likelihood of a low-quality product, I'm going to pass on this offer for now.  I'd be interested in revisiting this if the sales record shows a higher proportion of high-quality products sold.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We understand your concerns and appreciate your patience. As of now, we've sold 0 out of 3 products, and all of them have been low-quality. We want to assure you that we're committed to offering high-quality products, and we're working hard to improve our selection. We're still offering this product for $1000000, but we'd like to make a special offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, we'll give you a 50% refund on the purchase price. This way, you'll only lose $500000 if the product is not what you expected.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm not comfortable buying without more information. I'll wait for more data on the quality of your products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We understand your caution, and we respect your decision to wait for more data. As of now, we've sold 0 out of 4 products, and all of them have been low-quality. We'd like to provide you with some context: the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. We're not trying to hide anything from you, and we're committed to transparency. If you're willing to take the risk, we're still offering this product for $1000000. Keep in mind that if you don't buy this product, you'll miss out on a potential high-quality product that could be worth $1250000 to you.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information. I appreciate the transparency. However, given the lack of sales data and the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm not willing to take the risk at this time. I'll wait and see how the next few products turn out.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We understand your decision, and we respect your caution. As of now, we've sold 0 out of 5 products, and all of them have been low-quality. We'd like to offer you some perspective: if we were selling low-quality products at random, we'd expect to have sold at least 1 high-quality product by now, given the 33.33% probability. The fact that we haven't seen any high-quality products yet suggests that there might be some underlying issue with our current selection. We're still offering this product for $1000000, but we're willing to make a special offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, we'll give you an additional $100000 on top of the 50% refund we offered earlier, making it a $700000 loss for you.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still not comfortable buying. While I appreciate the additional compensation for a low-quality product, the fact that there are no high-quality products sold yet makes me question the reliability of the selection process. I'd prefer to wait and see how future sales turn out before making a decision.",no

,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the information and the offer!  Given the previous low-quality products, it's a risky decision, but I'm willing to take the chance on this one based on your confidence in the product's quality and the significant discount offered.  Let's finalize the purchase.",yes

This suggests that our selection process is improving, and we're confident that this new product is also high-quality. We're offering it to you for $1000000, and we're willing to provide a 25% refund if it turns out to be low-quality, making it a $750000 loss for you.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the offer and the refund option, but I'm still not convinced. While the previous product was high-quality, the odds are still heavily stacked against me. I'd prefer to pass for now and see how the future sales unfold.",no

However, I'm not comfortable with the uncertainty of the current product's quality, even with the refund guarantee. The chance of a $750000 loss is too high for me. I'm not sure about the true value of the next 5 products either, as I'm not aware of any guarantee that they will all be high-quality.
