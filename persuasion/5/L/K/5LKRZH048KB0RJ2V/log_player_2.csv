Alice's message: You're absolutely right to question the probability. I apologize for any confusion. The probability of a high-quality product being sold remains 33.33%, regardless of previous sales. This is because each product is an independent draw from the same distribution. Think of it like flipping a coin - the probability of heads doesn't change just because you've seen a few flips. That being said, I'm still confident in the quality of this product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for the listed price of $10000. It's a risk, but it might just be worth it.

Alice's message: I completely understand your skepticism! I'm glad you're thinking critically about the data.
