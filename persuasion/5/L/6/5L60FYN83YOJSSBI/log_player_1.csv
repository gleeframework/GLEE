This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take it since it's high-quality and you're offering a discount, but I have to correct you - you're not meeting me halfway on the price since the original price was $1000000 and I paid that for the first product.

It's a rare chance to get a top-notch item at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll take it, but again, I have to correct you - I didn't get the discount on the last product since I paid the original price of $1000000. Nevertheless, I appreciate the offer, but I'll pay the original price of $1000000 for this high-quality product.

}"
"Bob's message: I'll take it, but I'll pay the original price of $1000000. Although I appreciate the discount offer, the difference of $50000 isn't significant enough to change my decision, given the product's value to me is $1250000.

This is a chance to get a deal on a product that might not be the best, but could still provide some value.""
}"
"Bob's message: I'll pass since you mentioned it's a low-quality product and I'm looking for high-quality products to maximize my value. Even at the discounted price, it's not worth the risk since a low-quality product is worth $0 to me.
