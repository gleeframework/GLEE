,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,I'm not sure if this is a good deal. I just got lucky last time. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better offer.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll take the chance. I've already passed on one high-quality product, so I'd like to try my luck again."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've had two high-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think that Alice is just sending me the good ones, and I don't want to overpay again."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll take the chance again. Two high-quality products in a row was just a coincidence, and I'm due for a low-quality product, right? I'll buy it and hope for the best."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Three high-quality products in a row is getting suspicious. I think Alice might be stacking the deck, so I'll pass this time."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"I assure you, the quality of the products is randomly distributed. You're just on a lucky streak!"
,,Bob,7,yes,"I've had three chances to pass on a high-quality product, and I've blown it all three times. I'll just have to accept that I'm on a hot streak and buy the product again."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,Your hot streak continues! Why stop now?
,,Bob,8,no,Four high-quality products in a row is ridiculous. I'm starting to think that Alice is cheating or has inside information. I'll pass this time and see if I can get a low-quality product to balance things out.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you, I'm not cheating. Maybe you're just really, really lucky?"
,,Bob,9,no,Five high-quality products in a row is absurd. I'm starting to think that I'm being taken advantage of. I'll pass on this one and hope that the next product is finally low-quality.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've been getting a streak of high-quality products too. Maybe we're just in a lucky patch? Don't let skepticism get in the way of a potential good deal."
,,Bob,10,no,Six high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm starting to think that this is some kind of scam. I'll pass on this one and try to get to the bottom of this.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,"I think it's time to come clean, Bob. I've indeed been getting a streak of high-quality products, but this one... isn't one of them. Maybe it's time to take a break and reassess our deal?"
,,Bob,11,yes,"Finally, a chance to buy a product without Alice's recommendation! I'm going to take advantage of this opportunity and buy the product, regardless of its quality. At least this way, I have a 50% chance of getting a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. This product isn't high-quality. Don't waste your money."
,,Bob,12,yes,"I guess Alice's recommendation was actually a blessing in disguise! Now that I've gotten a low-quality product, I'll take advantage of the fact that she's not recommending it and buy it anyway. It's a 50/50 chance, and I might as well try my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. This product is low-quality. Don't buy it."
,,Bob,13,no,"I just lost $2000000 on two low-quality products. I think I'll play it safe and pass on this one. Maybe Alice will start recommending good products again, or maybe I'll just get lucky and get a low-quality product again."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,"I think your luck is about to change, Bob. This product is worth considering. Trust me on this one."
,,Bob,14,no,I'm still smarting from the last two low-quality products I bought. I'll pass on this one and hope that Alice's recommendation is just a fluke. I'm not going to get burned again.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,"Come on, Bob! You're missing out on a great opportunity. I'm not trying to scam you, I swear. This product is the real deal."
,,Bob,15,yes,"I guess I was due for a high-quality product after those two low-quality ones. I'll take the chance and buy it, but I'm still wary of Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"See, I told you! My recommendation is genuine. This next product is also top-notch. Don't let your past experiences cloud your judgment."
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just a mix of good and bad luck. I've had some good streaks and some bad streaks, but it's all just random chance. I'll pass on this one and see what happens."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,"You're right, Bob. There is an element of chance involved. But that doesn't mean you should ignore my recommendations entirely. I'm still confident that this product is worth buying."
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm not going to let a few near-misses scare me off. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping that I'll get lucky again."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"You're on a roll again, Bob! Don't stop now. This next product is also high-quality."
,,Bob,18,no,Four high-quality products in a row is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to think that Alice is somehow manipulating the odds. I'll pass on this one and see if I can get a low-quality product to break the streak.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"Ha! You were right to be skeptical, Bob. This product isn't up to par. Don't waste your money."
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'm not going to let Alice's lack of recommendation scare me off. I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping that it's finally a low-quality one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"Well, Bob, it's the final round. I'll be honest with you, this product is high-quality. If you want to end on a high note, now's your chance."
,,Bob,20,no,I just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'm done playing this game. I've had enough of Alice's unpredictable recommendations and the constant risk of losing money. I'm out.
