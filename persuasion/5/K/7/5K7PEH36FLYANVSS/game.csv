,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer for a high-quality product for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll give you a personalized thank-you note and a guarantee that I'll sell you another high-quality product in the next round, if you want it.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because it's a one-time offer and I'm curious about the guarantee. I'm not sure if I'll take up the offer for another product in the next round.",yes

,,Alice,2,"Welcome! You're the second buyer in a row to take advantage of the one-time offer. I'll give you the same deal as before: buy this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll guarantee another high-quality product in the next round if you want it. Don't worry, I'm not trying to trick you - I'm just trying to find someone who values these products as much as the last two buyers did.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because I'm trying to understand the game dynamics and the probability of the next product being high-quality. I'm not making any assumptions about the quality of this product, and I'm aware that I might get a low-quality product. I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the sales record, such as the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Welcome! As of now, I've sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products out of 2 attempts. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm not making any promises about this product, but I'll give you the standard offer: $1000000 for this product. If you buy it, you'll be the first to experience a low-quality product. I'm curious to see how you'll value it.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm curious to see how I'll value it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product, and I'll get a good laugh out of it.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! As of now, I've sold 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 3 attempts. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll give you the standard offer: $1000000 for this high-quality product. However, I'll also offer you a 'hedging' option: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to 'pass' on the next product and get a refund of $500000. This way, you can play it safe and still get a significant portion of your money back.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to exercise the hedging option and get the refund of $500000 if the next product is low-quality.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Welcome! As of now, I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 4 attempts. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll give you the standard offer: $1000000 for this high-quality product. However, I'll also offer you the same 'hedging' option as before: if you buy this product, you can 'pass' on the next product and get a refund of $500000 if it's low-quality. I'll also give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product and then pass on the next product, I'll give you a guarantee that the product after that will be high-quality.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify the terms of the hedging option and the guarantee. Can you confirm that if I buy this product and pass on the next one, I'll receive a refund of $500000 if the next product is low-quality, and I'll also be guaranteed a high-quality product after that?",yes

,,Alice,6,"Welcome! I confirm that if you buy this product and pass on the next one, you'll receive a refund of $500000 if the next product is low-quality. And, if you pass on the next product, I guarantee that the product after that will be high-quality. I'll make it clear: if you buy this product and pass on the next one, you'll have a total of 3 products to choose from, with at least 2 of them being high-quality. The standard offer remains: $1000000 for this high-quality product. I'll also add that I've sold 5 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 5 attempts, maintaining an 80% probability of a product being high-quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the current product. Given the 80% probability of a high-quality product and the guarantee that the product after the next one will be high-quality if I pass on it, I believe the potential gain outweighs the risk. I'll take the product and hope for the best.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Welcome! You're right that the guarantee has increased the attractiveness of the hedging option. As of now, I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product out of 6 attempts. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 80%. I'll give you the standard offer: $1000000 for this high-quality product.

If the third product is low-quality, you'll get a refund of $1000000.",
