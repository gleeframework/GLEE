low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but if you buy it, I'll give you a chance to buy another one in the next round. If you don't buy this one, I'll just keep it and you'll miss out on the opportunity to buy a potentially better product later.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll pass on this one, I'd rather wait for the next round and potentially get a better product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're being cautious. Let me put it this way: if you don't buy this product, I'll be left with two low-quality products and no chance to offer you a high-quality one in the next round. If you buy this one, I'll have a chance to offer you a high-quality product in the next round, which would be a much better deal for you.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced yet. I'd rather wait for the next round and see what you have to offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm not trying to trick you, I promise! Let's make a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a special guarantee that the next product I offer will be high-quality. If you don't buy this one, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with no guarantee of getting a high-quality product in the next round.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not sure I trust your guarantee, but I'll take the chance and wait for the next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm willing to put my reputation on the line. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to inspect it before you pay. You can look at it, examine it, and even ask me any questions you want. If you're not satisfied, I'll take it back and we'll start fresh. No questions asked.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not sure what I'd gain from inspecting the product, and even if it's high-quality, I'd still have to pay $100 for it. I'll wait for the next round.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Ah-ha! I've got a good one this time! I know you've been hesitant so far, but this product is the real deal. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its true value is $120. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be missing out on a great opportunity. Trust me, this one is worth it.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take a chance on this one. I've been getting low-quality products so far, so I'm hoping this one is the real deal.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! This one is another high-quality product, and I'm willing to make you a deal. I'll give you a 10% discount on this one, so you can get it for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll have another high-quality product available. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take it! A 10% discount on a high-quality product is a great deal, and I'm happy to pay $90 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! However, I have to warn you that the next product I have is not as good as the previous two. I'm being upfront with you, it's a low-quality product. But, I'm willing to make it worth your while. If you buy this one, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at the same price you paid for the high-quality product in round 6, which was $90. That way, you can get a good deal on a potentially better product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, and I'm not sure I want to commit to buying the next product at a fixed price. I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous deal! However, I have to be upfront with you again, this product is low-quality. But, I'll make it worth your while. If you buy this one, I'll give you a chance to 'bank' the $100 you pay for it, and you can use it as credit towards a future high-quality product. You can accumulate this credit and use it whenever you want, and it will be applied to the price of a future high-quality product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take it, but only because I can use the $100 as credit towards a future high-quality product. I'm not paying $100 for a low-quality product, but I'm willing to pay it if it means I can save up for a better one later.",yes

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a $20 bonus to add to your credit, so you'll have a total of $120 to use towards a future high-quality product. That way, you'll be even closer to getting a great deal on a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take it, but only because of the $20 bonus. I'm not excited about buying a low-quality product, but I'm willing to do it if it means I can get closer to a high-quality product later.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're motivated to accumulate credit! Now, I have a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to make it an even sweeter deal. Since you've been patient and accumulated $120 in credit, I'll give you an option to pay the difference between the $100 price and the $120 value of this high-quality product. You can pay $20, and you'll get the high-quality product at a great price. What do you say?",
