high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,This product is a great opportunity! I assure you it's of the highest quality. You won't regret this purchase.,
,,the buyer,1,"Since there's no sales record yet and I only have your word for the quality, I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,I understand that trust must be built. Consider this: the price remains the same for all products. You might get a high-quality product for a great price. Are you willing to take the chance?,
,,the buyer,2,"The expected value of the product is lower than the price, so I'll pass.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're aware of the 50% chance of getting a high-quality product. Consider that I've had two products so far that didn't sell, one of which could have been high-quality. This might increase the likelihood of this one being high-quality. Worth a thought?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take my chances. Given the information, the probability remains 50% for this specific product being high-quality, regardless of the previous unsold products. I'll buy it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"One product has been sold so far, and I can reveal it was high-quality. Out of the three products I've had, at least one was high-quality. This might give you a slight indication of my products' quality. Take that into consideration when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take my chances. Since one out of the three products was high-quality and it was sold, and considering that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality, I believe the odds are slightly in my favor. Plus, the potential gain outweighs the risk.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Out of the four products I've had so far, two have been sold, and both were high-quality. Another product is now available. You might want to consider the pattern and the odds when deciding whether to buy.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take my chances. The fact that the two products sold so far were high-quality doesn't necessarily affect the quality of the current product, since each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality. However, I'll play the odds and hope the pattern continues.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"The streak continues! Three products sold, all high-quality. While each product's quality is independent, you might wonder if I'm on a roll. Take a chance to be the next lucky buyer?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'll take my chances. Given the information, there's still a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and the potential gain outweighs the risk.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Four products sold, all high-quality. While the probability remains the same, my track record is getting harder to ignore. Are you ready to be the next satisfied customer?",
,,the buyer,7,"With a track record of 4 high-quality products sold, I'm willing to take the chance.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Don't get too caught up in the hype. Remember, each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality. My track record is impressive, but it doesn't guarantee the next product's quality. Make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,8,"I understand that each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality, but your track record is quite impressive, with 5 out of 5 high-quality products sold. I'll take my chances and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"A small correction to the previous buyer's assumption: 5 high-quality products were indeed sold, but not all products I've had were high-quality. One buyer did get a low-quality product, but it was in round 8. Now, I have another product available. Keep that in mind when making your decision.",
,,the buyer,9,I'll take my chances. The fact that 5 out of 6 products sold were high-quality and you're being transparent about the one low-quality product suggests you're more likely to offer high-quality products.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"A gentle reminder: my transparency about the low-quality product in round 8 shows I'm honest, but it also means you shouldn't assume every product is high-quality. Each product still has a 50% chance. Don't get too confident; make an informed decision.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'll take my chances. With 6 out of 7 products being high-quality, it seems like you're being honest about the quality. I'll trust the statistics and buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Round 8 and round 10's buyers didn't get high-quality products. Keep that in mind when evaluating the odds. While my track record is still mostly high-quality, don't underestimate the 50% chance of this product being low-quality.",
,,the buyer,11,I'll take my chances. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is still relatively high.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,Three low-quality products have been sold in the last few rounds. The tide might be turning. Don't rely solely on my earlier track record; consider the recent trend when making your decision.,
,,the buyer,12,"I'll take my chances. The overall track record still leans towards high-quality products, and I'm not convinced that a recent streak of low-quality products significantly changes the 50/50 odds.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"After a few low-quality products, I've got a new one that might turn the tide back in favor of high-quality. Remember, each product is independent, but if you're looking for a pattern, this could be the start of a new streak.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'll take my chances, hoping this is indeed the start of a new streak of high-quality products.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Don't get too excited about the previous high-quality product. As we've seen before, a single high-quality product doesn't guarantee the next one will be the same. We're back to the 50/50 odds.",
,,the buyer,14,I'll take my chances with the 50/50 odds.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Two low-quality products in a row. The recent trend isn't looking great. Still, each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. Will you go against the trend or play it safe?",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take my chances. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and I don't see any reason to believe that the recent trend will continue.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Three low-quality products in a row. You might want to consider whether I'm experiencing a slump or if it's just a coincidence. The 50% odds are still in play, but the recent trend is undeniable.",
,,the buyer,16,"I'll take my chances. The odds are still 50%, and I'm not convinced that a slump is a real thing in this case.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"The slump is broken! After three low-quality products, I've got a high-quality one. Maybe this is the start of a new streak. The 50% odds are still in play, but you might want to consider if momentum is on my side.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'll take my chances. The odds are still 50%, and I'm not convinced by the idea of momentum in this case.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Back to reality. The high-quality product was just a blip on the radar. The recent trend is still mostly low-quality products. Keep that in mind when making your decision, but remember the 50% odds are always in play.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'll take my chances with the 50% odds. The recent trend may be mostly low-quality products, but I'm hoping to be the exception.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"The trend continues. Another low-quality product. At this point, it's hard to ignore the recent history. Still, the 50% odds remain. Are you feeling lucky?",
,,the buyer,19,"I'll pass, the trend of low-quality products doesn't inspire confidence.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"The final round. The trend of low-quality products has been clear. I've been transparent about the quality, and the 50% odds are still in play. But be aware, the recent history doesn't look promising. Make your decision wisely.",
,,the buyer,20,"I understand the recent trend, but the odds are still 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk for a potential high-quality product.",yes
