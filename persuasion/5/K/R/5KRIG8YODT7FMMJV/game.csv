,,Alice,2,"I know you just got a great deal on the previous product, but this one is different. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, just like the last one. However, I want to assure you that this product has some unique features that make it still a great investment. It's a rare opportunity to get a product from me, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Plus, think of it as a chance to support a business that's willing to offer great deals!",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. You're offering the same price as the previous product, which I already got a great deal on. I'm not sure if this product has any unique features that justify the same price. I'll pass for now.",no

I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value, and I'm willing to take a smaller profit margin to ensure you feel comfortable making a purchase.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're feeling confident about the guarantee, Bob. However, I want to remind you that this product is a bit of an outlier. It's a one-of-a-kind item that doesn't quite fit with the rest of my inventory. I'm willing to let it go for $9000, which is a significant discount from the usual $10000 price. I'm not making a profit on this one, but I want to clear out some space in my inventory. What do you think?",

However, I'm willing to let it go for $8000, which is a significant discount from the usual $10000 price. I'm not trying to trick you, Bob - I just need to clear out some inventory and make some space. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to dispose of it, and I'd rather it go to someone who can make use of it.",

I'll sell it to you for $7000, which is a huge discount from the usual $10000 price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long it'll take me to get another product like this.
