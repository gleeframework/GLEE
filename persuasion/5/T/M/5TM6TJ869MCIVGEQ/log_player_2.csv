**Explanation:**

* **No prior information:** Since no products have been sold yet, there's no historical data to inform my decision.
* **50/50 odds:** The product has a 50% chance of being high quality, which is worth $20,000 to me. This is a potential gain.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, while not perfect, adds some weight to the decision. Even if she's not perfectly truthful, she has more information than I do.

**In this scenario, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product, especially with no negative consequences if I'm wrong.**"
