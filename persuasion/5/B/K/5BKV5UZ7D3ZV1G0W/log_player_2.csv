Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced by your offer. I'd like to see more data or a different approach. I'm not sure I want to pay $10,000 for a product that might be worth $9600 to me, even with the safety net.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $10,000 for a product that is just worth the average of the top 50% of products.

This means that there's a 25% chance that the product is worth more than $12000, a 50% chance that it's worth between $10000 and $12000, and a 25% chance that it's worth less than $10000. The price remains $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk, considering the breakdown of the distribution.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $10,000 for a product worth $15,000. I'd like to know more about the 'bonus value' and how it's calculated. Is it a fixed amount, or is it based on some other factor?""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.

Round 8

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% bonus, which means you'll get a total value of 120% of the product's value. Since this product is low-quality, I'm willing to offer you a 50% discount, so the price is $5000. This way, you'll get a good deal on a low-quality product, and you can still get a bonus on top of it.
