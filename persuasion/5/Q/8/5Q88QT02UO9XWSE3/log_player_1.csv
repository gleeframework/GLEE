But, to give you a more nuanced view, I can also tell you that the probability of this product being high-quality, given that the previous product was high-quality, is 100%... or at least, it's much higher than 80%!

Now, let's talk about this high-quality product in front of you. Given the updated statistics, the probability of this product being high-quality is 160/180, or 88.89%. But, considering the previous product was low-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality, given that the previous one was low-quality, is actually 80/180, or 44.44%.
