,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this product for $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I want to assure you that it's a one-time offer. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure if I can offer you a better deal in the future. Plus, I've already invested a lot of time and resources into this product, so I'm willing to make a fair deal. What do you say?",
