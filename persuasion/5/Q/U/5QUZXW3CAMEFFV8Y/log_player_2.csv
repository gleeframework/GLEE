**Explanation:**

* **The buyer has no information about the specific product they are being offered.** They only know that the seller has a 50% chance of offering a high-quality product and a 50% chance of offering a low-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation is valuable.**  While the seller could be dishonest, it's in their best interest to sell high-quality products to build trust and encourage future sales.
* **The statistics are limited.** There's only one previous sale, and it was a high-quality product, which isn't enough to make a definitive judgment.
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk.** If the product is high-quality, the buyer earns a $2,000 profit. If it's low-quality, they lose $10,000.  Given the limited information and the potential for profit, it's a reasonable gamble to take."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signal:** The fact that 2 out of 4 buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product is a positive signal. It suggests Alice might have some insight into the product quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $12,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**Important Note:** This decision is based purely on the limited information provided. In a real-world scenario, more factors would need to be considered before making such a significant purchase."

**Reasoning:**

While the odds are 50/50 for any given product, the data suggests a positive trend.  Here's why:

* **Past Performance:**  Alice has sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total sales. This is a 40% success rate, which is better than the 50% random chance. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice likely knows the quality of this product, and her recommending it adds further confidence.  

**Risk vs. Reward:**

* **Risk:** The product could be low quality, and you'd lose $10,000.
* **Reward:**  The product could be high quality, and you'd gain $2,000 ($12,000 value - $10,000 cost). 

Given the positive data and Alice's recommendation, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
