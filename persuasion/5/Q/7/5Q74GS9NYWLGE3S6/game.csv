However, I want to point out that the last two products were sold at the same price as the previous ones, despite the fact that one of them was actually low-quality. This might be a sign that I'm not always being transparent about the quality of my products. I'm offering this one to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that there's a 20% chance it's not worth anything to you.",

I want to point out that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is actually 87.5%, which is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. This might be a sign that I'm not as good at selling high-quality products as I thought. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is actually lower than usual.",
