Let me put it this way: even if I'm selling at a lower rate of high-quality products than expected, that just means I'm being more selective about which high-quality products I sell. And that means the ones I do sell are all the more valuable. This product, for example, is a hidden gem. It's worth way more than $100, but I'm willing to let it go for a steal. Take a chance on me!""}"
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the offer, but I'm not comfortable taking a risk on a product with such an unknown quality and no track record.
