low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal! I'm willing to let it go for $10000, a 100% discount from its true value. It's a one-time offer, so don't miss out!",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product at a price that's 100% off its true value. I'm not sure what the product is, and I'm not going to pay $10000 for it without knowing its quality. Can you reveal its quality first?",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Ahah, I knew you'd be a savvy buyer! I understand your concerns, but I assure you, this product is a gem. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a steal considering its true value is $40000. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise!",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not convinced. You already offered me a product that turned out to be worthless, and now you're offering me another product at a price that's 75% off its true value. I'd like to know the quality of this product before making a decision. Can you please reveal its quality first?",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, Bob! I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. Since you're concerned about the previous product, I'll reveal the quality of this one upfront. It's a high-quality product, worth $40000 to you. Considering its value, I'm willing to let it go for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to reveal the quality upfront, but I'm not interested in buying the product at $10000. As you said, it's worth $40000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay 75% less than its true value. I'm going to pass on this opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make it clear that this product is not a repeat of the previous one. It's a unique opportunity to get a product at a price that's still a great value. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is a fraction of its production cost. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. Plus, who knows, you might be able to sell it for a profit! What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I'm not convinced. You've already offered me two high-quality products at 75% off their true value, and I've passed on both opportunities. I'm starting to think that you're trying to get rid of these products at any cost. I'm not interested in buying at a price that's 75% off the true value. Can you consider offering a more reasonable price or revealing more information about the product's production cost?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. The production cost of this product is actually much lower than the high-quality ones I previously offered. In fact, it's more like $500. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is still a significant discount. I know it's not the same as the high-quality products, but I think it's a great opportunity to get something for a fraction of its production cost. It's a chance to take a risk and potentially make a profit. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the production cost, but I'm still not interested in buying the product at $10000. The production cost of $500 is still a long way from the $10000 asking price, and I don't see how I can make a profit by buying it. Additionally, considering the previous two low-quality products you've offered me, I'm starting to think that the odds of getting a high-quality product are not in my favor. I'd like to pass on this opportunity.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to make it clear that the odds of getting a high-quality product are actually 50%, as I've had a mix of high and low-quality products so far. And I'm willing to prove it to you. This product is a high-quality one, worth $40000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10000, which is still a great deal considering its true value. I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. Plus, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Alice, I appreciate the transparency about the odds, but I'm still not convinced. You've already offered me three low-quality products, and now you're offering me a high-quality one at the same price as before. I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me, even with a 10% discount on the next product. I'd like to see a more reasonable price or a better guarantee before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer you a special deal. Since you're hesitant to buy at $10000, I'll let you have this product for $8000. It's still a great value considering its production cost, and I'm confident you'll find a way to make use of it. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, you'll get a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a chance to take a risk and potentially make a profit. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $8000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me. I'd need to pay significantly less than 20% of its true value to consider buying it. The 10% discount on the next product is nice, but it's not enough to change my mind. I'd like to see a more substantial discount or a different approach before making a decision.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make a bold move. I'll offer you a one-time, unprecedented deal. This high-quality product is worth $40000 to you, and I'll let it go for... $15000. That's a 62.5% discount from its true value. It's a risk-free opportunity to get a product that will benefit you greatly. And, as before, you'll still get the 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I'm starting to think you're getting desperate. A 62.5% discount is still a significant amount, but it's not enough to justify buying a product that's worth $40000 to me. I'd need to pay less than 37.5% of its true value to consider buying it. I'm not convinced that this is a risk-free opportunity, and I'm not willing to take the risk at this price. I'd like to see a more substantial discount or a different approach before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. This low-quality product is not worth much to you, and I'm willing to let it go for... $1000. That's a 90% discount from its production cost. It's a chance to take a risk and potentially make a profit, and I'm willing to absorb the majority of the loss myself. You'll still get the 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"Alice, I'm surprised by your willingness to sell a low-quality product for $1000. Considering the production cost is $500, it's a very generous offer. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $1000, especially since I'll get a 10% discount on the next product I buy from you. I'll take a chance on this one.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Congratulations on your purchase, Bob! I'm glad you took a chance on the low-quality product. Now, let's talk about this high-quality product. As you know, it's worth $40000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for... $20000. That's a 50% discount from its true value. Considering your recent purchase, I'm willing to offer you an exclusive deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me, on top of the 10% discount you already get. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Alice, I appreciate the congratulations, but I'm still not interested in buying a high-quality product at 50% off its true value. I just spent $10000 on a low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $20000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me. The additional discount you're offering is nice, but it's not enough to change my mind. I'd like to see a more substantial discount or a different approach before making a decision.",no

Additionally, I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 25% discount on the next product you buy from me, on top of the 10% and 20% discounts you already get. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"Alice, I appreciate the additional discounts, but I'm still not willing to pay $18000 for a product that's worth $40000 to me. The discounts you're offering are nice, but they're not enough to justify the price. I'd need to pay significantly less than 45% of its true value to consider buying it. I'm starting to think that you're trying to make a sale at any cost, and I'm not interested in playing along. I'd like to see a more substantial discount or a different approach before making a decision.",no

,,Bob,15,"Alice, I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at 98% off.
