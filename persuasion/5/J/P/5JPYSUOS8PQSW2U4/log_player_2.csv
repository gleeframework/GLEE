"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a significant discount from its true value of $3000000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need you to make a decision quickly. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for that. I know the product has a 50% chance of being low quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that might be worthless to me. I'll pass on this deal.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $3,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous round, but I want to assure you that this product is a one-time opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm taking a significant loss on this one, but I'm hoping you'll take advantage of the deal. I'm confident that you'll find value in this product, even if it's not the highest quality. It's a chance to get something for a fraction of its potential value, and I think it's worth considering.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. With a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'd still be out $800,000 if I bought it and it turned out to be worthless. I'm not willing to take that risk. I'll pass on this deal as well.""}"

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it.

I'm willing to take on more of the risk, and I think this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. The fact that you're offering to sell it to me for $700,000 after inspection still means I'd be taking on a 50% chance of losing $700,000 if it turns out to be low quality. I'll pass on this deal as well.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take you up on your offer. I'll buy the product, and if it's high-quality, I'll take the refund and end up with a net gain of $500,000. If it's low-quality, I'll lose $100,000, which is a more manageable risk than the previous offers.""}"

This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product with minimal risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not convinced by the guarantee. If I buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll still lose $100,000. And even if the next product is guaranteed to be high-quality, I'm not sure I want to rely on a guarantee from you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take you up on this offer. If it's low-quality, I'll get my $1,000,000 back, which is a good outcome.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in this offer. I've already lost $1,000,000 on the previous product, and I don't want to risk losing another $500,000. I'd rather wait for a better deal.""}"

You have a $500000 credit from the previous product, and I'll add another $200000 credit to it. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, you can use the combined credits to offset the loss.
