,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm trying to break the pattern.
