Alice's message: I understand your caution, and I'm happy to provide you with more information about this product. However, I'd like to point out that you've seen two products sold in a row, and both were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than the overall average. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm confident that it's a valuable opportunity. But if you're still unsure, I can offer you a simple bet: if this product is low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we can start fresh with the next product.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, and I respect your skepticism. You're right, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%.
