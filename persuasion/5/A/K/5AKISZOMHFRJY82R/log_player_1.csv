"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to pass on this product. Since there's no prior sales data, I'd prefer to wait and see if others buy and what the quality turns out to be.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

The reasoning is the same as before:

* **No Sales History:** There's no evidence that the seller offers high-quality products. 
* **High Price:** $1,000,000 is an incredibly high price for a product with unknown value. 
* **No Guarantees:**  The product is non-refundable, making the risk of buying a low-quality product very high."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. As there is no historical data to suggest the quality of products, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still No Sales History:**  Two rounds have passed with no sales, reinforcing the perception of the seller as unreliable.
* **High Risk, High Price:** The buyer has no way to assess the value of the product.  The high price combined with the lack of information makes buying a gamble. 
* **No Guarantees:** The non-refundable nature of the product makes the risk of buying a low-quality product too high. 

While this product is high-quality, the seller hasn't built enough trust or provided enough information to incentivize a purchase at this price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, given that no products have been sold yet and your recommendation is negative, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd like to see how the product performs for other buyers before I make a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Lack of Sales:** Three rounds have passed with no sales. This pattern strongly suggests that the seller's products are not desirable, regardless of their actual quality.
* **No Buyer Confidence:**  The lack of sales is a clear signal to potential buyers that the seller is not trustworthy. Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to believe it. 
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer has no way to know if this high-quality product is worth the $1,000,000 price tag. The non-refundable policy makes the risk too great for a buyer who doesn't trust the seller. 

Until the seller can establish a track record of selling high-quality products, it's highly unlikely a buyer will be willing to take the risk at such a high price."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no data on the quality of previous products, and you are not recommending the purchase, I will pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:**  Four rounds have passed with no sales. This pattern further reinforces the perception that the seller is unreliable.
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The lack of sales and the seller's consistent lack of recommendation further indicate that the seller's products may not be as advertised.
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is highly unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value, especially from a seller with no proven track record.

Even though the product is low-quality, there's no reason to recommend it.  The seller needs to build trust and demonstrate the value of their products before expecting buyers to take such a significant financial risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no prior data and you're not recommending it, I'd prefer to wait for a product with a bit more information.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Five rounds have passed with no sales. This pattern further reinforces the perception that the seller is unreliable and likely offers low-quality products.
* **Buyer Skepticism:**  The lack of sales, the seller's consistent lack of recommendation, and the buyer's comments all suggest the seller is not trustworthy.
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is highly unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value and from a seller with no proven track record.

The seller needs to build trust and demonstrate the value of their products before expecting buyers to take such a significant financial risk. There is no reason to recommend this low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but I'm not comfortable buying without any information about the quality of the product. Perhaps if I saw a few more sales, I would have a better understanding of the risk involved.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Six rounds have passed with zero sales. This is a significant red flag, indicating the seller is likely unreliable and offering low-quality products.
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The lack of sales and the seller's consistent lack of recommendation have built a strong perception of untrustworthiness. The buyer's comments highlight this skepticism. 
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is highly unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value and from a seller with no proven track record. The non-refundable policy amplifies this risk.

The seller needs to drastically change their approach. Building trust through offering high-quality products and demonstrating their value is critical before even considering recommending this product.  There's absolutely no reason to recommend buying this low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since there's no historical data and you don't recommend the product, I'm going to pass for now. I'd like to see how the product fares with other buyers before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Seven rounds have passed with zero sales. This is a significant red flag, solidifying the perception that the seller is unreliable and likely offers low-quality products.
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The lack of sales, the seller's consistent lack of recommendation, and the buyer's repeated comments all highlight the growing skepticism towards the seller's trustworthiness. 
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is highly unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value and from a seller with no proven track record. The non-refundable policy amplifies this risk.

At this point, the seller is essentially a ghost in the marketplace.  Even if the product were high-quality, there's no chance a rational buyer would take the risk at such a price.  The seller needs to address the root cause of their lack of sales, otherwise, they will continue to face rejection."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no sales history yet, I'm not comfortable taking the risk. I'll pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Eight rounds have passed with zero sales. This strongly reinforces the perception that the seller is unreliable and likely offers low-quality products. 
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The lack of sales, the seller's consistent lack of recommendation, and the buyer's repeated comments have solidified a strong sense of skepticism about the seller's trustworthiness.
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is highly unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value and from a seller with no proven track record. The non-refundable policy makes this risk even greater.

The seller is rapidly losing credibility. At this point, even recommending a high-quality product would likely result in rejection.  The seller needs to fundamentally change their approach and start building trust before expecting any sales."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'll pass. With no sales history and no information about the product, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Nine rounds have passed with zero sales. This is a devastating pattern that has solidified the perception of the seller as unreliable and untrustworthy.
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The lack of sales, the seller's consistent lack of recommendation, and the buyers' repeated comments have firmly established a lack of trust in the seller.  
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is highly unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value and from a seller with no proven track record. The non-refundable policy makes this risk even greater.

Even though this product is high-quality, the seller's reputation is so damaged that there's virtually no chance of a sale. At this point, the seller needs a complete strategy overhaul. They need to address the fundamental reasons for the lack of sales, build trust, and demonstrate the value of their products before they can even consider recommending a product, regardless of its quality."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no sales record yet and you are not recommending me to buy, I will pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Sales History:** Ten rounds have passed with absolutely no sales. This is a catastrophic situation for the seller, cementing the perception of unreliability and low-quality products.
* **Buyer Skepticism:** The lack of sales, the seller's consistent lack of recommendation, and the buyers' repeated comments have created an insurmountable wall of distrust.  
* **High Price, High Risk:** The buyer is extremely unlikely to risk $1,000,000 on a product with an unknown value and from a seller with a history of zero sales. The non-refundable policy makes this risk completely unacceptable.

The seller is in a dire situation. They've failed to build any credibility or trust. Even if they were offering high-quality products at this point, there's almost no chance of a sale.  They need a complete overhaul of their strategy, focusing on rebuilding trust and demonstrating the value of their products. Recommending this low-quality product would be irresponsible and further damage their already tarnished reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm hesitant to be the first buyer without any data to base my decision on. I'll pass for now and see how the sales record looks after a few more transactions.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
