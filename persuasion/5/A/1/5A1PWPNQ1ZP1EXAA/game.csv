high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm only selling it to you because I really need to get rid of it, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a much higher price.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $120 to me for $100, even if you're trying to get rid of it. I'd rather wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product at the price you're asking.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've had a change of heart. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll throw in a 10% discount on the next product I offer, if you buy this one. It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something to you.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $120 to me for $100, even with a discount on the next one. I'll wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product at the price you're asking.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've reconsidered the price of the last product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $110. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a high-quality product like this anywhere else.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take it. $110 is still a good deal for a product worth $120 to me.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've got a product that's similar to the last one I sold you. It's a great opportunity to get a second product at the same price as the first one, but with the 10% discount I offered earlier still in effect. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next one as well.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying another product at the same price as the last one, even with a discount. I'd rather wait for a chance to buy a new product at the discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to let this product go for $90, a full 10% off the original price. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to sell it for even at this low price.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've had a string of low-quality products lately, and I'm starting to think I'm just not very good at selecting them. But I'm willing to take a chance on this one and sell it to you for $100, no discount. Maybe you can help me turn my luck around?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even if you're willing to sell it to me at the full price.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've got a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, just like the last one. But this time, I'll throw in a free inspection report, so you can see for yourself that it's a great product. It's a $120 product, and I'm letting it go for a steal.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take it. The free inspection report is a nice touch, but I'm willing to trust my instincts and buy the product at the discounted price.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. But this time, I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty, so you can have peace of mind knowing that you're protected in case anything goes wrong. It's a $120 product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take it. The warranty is a nice addition, but I'm mostly just excited to buy another high-quality product at a discounted price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think I've got a pattern going here. Two high-quality products in a row, and now a low-quality one. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $90, just like the last low-quality product. I'll even throw in a 5% discount on the next product, if you buy this one.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product at a good price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm starting to think I've got a bad streak going. Three low-quality products in a row. I'll sell this one to you for $80, and I'll also throw in a 10% discount on the next product, and a 5% discount on the one after that. It's a chance to break my losing streak and get a good deal on a product.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the discounts, but I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a discounted price. I'll wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product at a good price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm willing to give you a chance to buy this product for $0. Yes, you heard that right, $0. I'll even throw in a 20% discount on the next product, a 15% discount on the one after that, and a 10% discount on the one after that. It's a chance to get a great deal, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to break the streak.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take it. At $0, it's essentially free, and the discounts on the next few products are a nice bonus.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Well, I guess I'm due for a break from the low-quality streak. But I'll be honest with you, Bob, I'm not optimistic about this one. I'll sell it to you for $0, just like the last one, and I'll give you a 25% discount on the next product, a 20% discount on the one after that, and a 15% discount on the one after that. It's a chance to keep the streak going, and I'm willing to take another loss to try to break it.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I already paid $100 for a $0 product last round, and I'm not interested in doing it again. I'll wait for a chance to buy a high-quality product at a good price.",no

,,Alice,14,"I'm glad I could redeem myself after the last few rounds. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This one's a bit of a special case, though - I've already sold you a high-quality product recently, so I'm offering you a loyalty discount of 5% off the price. It's a chance to get another great product at an even better price.",

I know you're not interested in buying junk, but I'm just trying to get rid of it. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product, and a 25% discount on the one after that. It's a chance to help me clear out some inventory and move on to better products.",

I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. I'm just going to tell you that it's not worth much to me, and I'm willing to give it to you for $0. No strings attached. Consider it a parting gift after our 20 rounds together.",
,,Bob,20,"I appreciate the parting gift, but I'm not going to accept it. I'm glad we've had a good experience together, but I'm not going to take a product that's worth $0 to me, no matter how nice you are about it.",no
