low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products Alice is offering are likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm also considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. I'd like to know more about your thought process behind the recommendation."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been 3 previous sales and no high-quality products have been sold. The probability of the product being high-quality seems low based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm suspicious that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products were high quality, I suspect the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than the overall probability, which is 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer is more optimistic.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the probability of a high-quality product hasn't decreased and I'm the 4th buyer. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the products Alice is recommending are likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for a new product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, it suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. This is consistent with the 66.67% chance of low-quality products. I'm skeptical about the current product and would rather wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 4 buyers have also bought the products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it less likely that the current product is high-quality."
