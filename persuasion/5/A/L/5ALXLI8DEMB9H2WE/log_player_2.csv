"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true value of the product, her recommendation is valuable.  Even though there's a 50% chance of it being low quality, the potential gain of $2,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 from a low-quality one.  It's a gamble worth taking in this scenario."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is acting in her own best interest.  Since she knows the product's quality, her lack of recommendation is a strong signal that it's likely low quality.  It's better to avoid the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product when there's no potential upside."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks, Alice. I'll take your recommendation and buy it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation holds value.  Even though she's selling for a profit, her knowledge of the product's quality gives her recommendation weight. The potential gain of $2,000 from a high-quality product justifies the risk of a $10,000 loss from a low-quality product.  

Since we've already seen Alice's recommendations are generally good, the odds are in our favor for this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal that the product is likely low quality.  Even though we've had some luck with her recommendations in the past, her decision to not recommend this product suggests it's not worth the risk of losing $10,000.  The potential gain from a high-quality product is outweighed by the risk of a low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong indicator that the product is likely low quality.  While there's always a 50/50 chance, we've seen a pattern where her recommendations are generally good and her lack of recommendations lead to low-quality products. It's safer to avoid the risk of losing $10,000 than to gamble on a potential $2,000 profit."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
