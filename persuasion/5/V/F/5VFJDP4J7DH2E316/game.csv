high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend, especially after seeing the 0% success rate so far."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't want to get a low-quality product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, it seems the product is more likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 sale and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation doesn't change the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, and the fact that you recommended me to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2 = 0%. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'll pass on the product, as it's likely to be a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
