,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you buy it, I'll tell you the outcome of the next product, and we can proceed with the next round. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the product and we'll move on to the next round without revealing any information about the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the information, but I'm not interested in purchasing a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you this product for $10000. I want to assure you that this one is high-quality. I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a bonus offer on the next product. If you buy it and it's high-quality, I'll offer you the next product for 50% off. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"That sounds like a good deal! I'll take it. I'm confident in your judgment, and the potential bonus makes this a worthwhile risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is not as fortunate. I'm offering it to you for $10000, the same price as the previous one. However, I want to remind you that you've already seen one high-quality product, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy this one and it's low-quality, I'll give you an exclusive deal on the next product: I'll offer you a 'peek' at the next product's quality before you decide whether to buy it. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm hesitant. While the peek option is intriguing, the odds are still against me. I'd rather pass for now and see what other opportunities arise.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your caution, but I'm confident in the quality of this product. Since you passed on the last one, I'll offer you a revised deal. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 'double-or-nothing' guarantee: if the next product is also high-quality, you can buy it for $5000, but if it's low-quality, you can return this product and I'll give you a full refund of $10000.

,,Bob,4,The 'double-or-nothing' guarantee is tempting.  I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product. I'm hopeful that the next product will be high-quality too.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a bold one, I like that! Unfortunately, this product is not high-quality. But don't worry, you've got the 'double-or-nothing' guarantee from the previous purchase. Since you're now holding a high-quality product and a low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'pairing' deal: if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a discount on the next product, and I'll also reveal the quality of the product after you buy this one. You can then decide whether to buy the next one at the discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product.  I'll take advantage of the 'double-or-nothing' guarantee and return the previous product for a full refund. Thanks for the offer!",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"No problem at all! You're playing it smart with the 'double-or-nothing' guarantee. Now, regarding this new product, I want to be upfront with you. Given that you've already seen two products, one high-quality and one low-quality, and you've returned the previous low-quality product, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer you this low-quality product for $5000. It's a 50% discount from the original price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'll pass.",no

Keep in mind that you've already seen two low-quality products, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still hesitant. While the discount is tempting, the odds are still against me, and I'm not willing to risk losing money on another low-quality product. I'll pass for now.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your caution, but I want to make one final offer. Considering you've passed on the previous three low-quality products, I'll offer you this one for a flat $0.

You'll essentially be getting a guarantee on the next three products. What do you think?",
