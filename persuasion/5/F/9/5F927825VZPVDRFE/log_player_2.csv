Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me give you a more general overview of my sales record. Out of 2 total sales, 1 has been high-quality. This means that 50% of my products have been high-quality so far. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I'm confident that it's a great value.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the data. To answer your question, the first product I sold was indeed high-quality. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total sales now. This new product is a completely different item, but I'm confident in its quality as well. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a price that's still a steal considering its true value. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I think you should too. This is a great opportunity to get a $12000 product at a fraction of the cost.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking a chance on us! As for the production process, I can assure you that we take quality control very seriously. However, I'd be lying if I said it's a foolproof system. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we may end up with a product that doesn't meet our standards. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I want to be upfront with you - the odds are that it's not high-quality. But I'm not going to sugarcoat it, and I'm not going to make promises I can't keep. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm willing to let you have it.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. To be honest, our quality control process is not foolproof, and we've had our fair share of mistakes.

I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I'm being upfront with you - it's not high-quality. If you're willing to take the risk, you can have it for the price of a low-quality product, which is essentially what it is. No promises, no refunds, just a product that's not worth much to anyone.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. To be honest, our production process is a complex one, and there's always a risk of human error or unforeseen circumstances that can affect the quality of the product. However, I can tell you that we have a rigorous testing and inspection process in place to catch any defects or issues before the product is shipped. Unfortunately, sometimes even with the best processes in place, mistakes can still happen. I'm offering this new product to you for $10000, and I'm being upfront with you - it's not high-quality.
