That way, you'll be getting an even better deal on a product worth $30,000 to you. Take advantage of this offer and make a smart investment!""}"

But we've had 11 rounds, and every single product has been high-quality. That's not a coincidence. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10,000, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it within the next 5 minutes. That brings the price down to $9,000.
