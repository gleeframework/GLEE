**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We only have one sale to go by. While it's positive that the first sale was a high-quality product, this is a tiny sample size.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a vested interest in selling.  It's unclear if her recommendation is truly based on the product's quality or if she's just trying to make a sale. 
* **Potential Gain:** The potential payoff of $400 if the product is high quality outweighs the potential loss of $100 if it's low quality. 

**Given the limited information, it's a gamble, but the potential reward justifies taking the risk.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The previous sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This is a strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are accurate.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows that a high-quality product is worth much more to you than a low-quality product.  It's in her best interest to recommend high-quality products to maximize her chances of selling them.

While there's still a chance the product could be low quality, the strong sales record and Alice's recommendation make this a calculated risk worth taking."
