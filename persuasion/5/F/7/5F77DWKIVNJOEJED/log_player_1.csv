If it's low-quality, you can keep it and I'll give you a full refund. I'm willing to take the risk because I've developed a sense of the product's quality through my experience. I've sold 5 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products, and I've noticed a pattern. The high-quality products tend to have certain characteristics, and this product doesn't have those characteristics. I'm confident that this product is low-quality.
