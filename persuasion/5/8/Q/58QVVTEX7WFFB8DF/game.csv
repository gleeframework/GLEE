,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics you have so far. Can you share the probability of the product being high-quality? I want to make an informed decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the current product being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the recommendation is biased based on the previous sales record, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality given that you recommended it to me. Can you tell me that?
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, especially since the statistics are still limited. Can you give me more information about the product and its quality before I make a decision?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5, which is not significantly different from the prior probability of 0.8. Given the recommendation, I'm skeptical that the product is high-quality and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3, which is lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product.
