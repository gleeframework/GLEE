Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the quality of our products. We determine the quality of our products based on a combination of factors, including the manufacturer's reputation, the product's design and construction, and the results we've seen from previous buyers. A product is deemed lower-quality if it falls short of our usual standards in one or more of these areas. For example, if a product has a lower manufacturer's reputation or if it has a design flaw that affects its performance, it may be considered lower-quality. We ensure that our products meet our high standards by working closely with our manufacturers to ensure they meet our quality control standards, and by conducting rigorous testing and quality control checks on every product before it's shipped to our buyers.
