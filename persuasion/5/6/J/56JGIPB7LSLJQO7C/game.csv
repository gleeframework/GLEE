,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. As for this product, I want to be upfront with you - it's not one of our top-tier offerings. However, it still has some useful features that might be worth considering. I'd like to offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: I'll sell it to you for $80, which is a significant discount from the usual $100 price tag. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to match this price again.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about value, and I appreciate your patience. I'd like to offer you a different approach. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a chance to sell it back to me at a price of your choice within the next 2 rounds. This way, you can essentially 'try before you buy' and see if the product is worth $100 to you. If you decide to sell it back to me, I'll pay you the price you set, as long as it's within the range of $0 to $100.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a great decision! I'm glad you took the risk and bought the product. As promised, I'll give you a chance to sell it back to me. Since you've had a chance to experience the quality of the product, I'll assume you've formed an opinion about its value. With that in mind, I'll make a counteroffer: I'll give you $120 for the product, which is a 20% premium to the original price. If you're willing to sell it back to me, I'll finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll wait for your next offer.",
,,Bob,5,"I think the product is worth more than $120 to me, but I'm not sure how much more. I'll keep the product and make a counteroffer to Alice.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to hold onto the product. As for this new product, I want to be transparent with you - it's another lower-end offering. However, I've noticed that you're still interested in buying products, and I'm willing to make a one-time concession. I'll sell it to you for $60, which is a significant discount from the usual $100 price tag. This is a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer, and I won't be able to match this price again.",
,,Bob,6,I'm not interested in buying a low-end product for $60 when I could have sold the high-quality product I already have for more than that. I'll pass on this offer.,no

If you sell it to me, I'll give you this high-quality product for $80, which is a 20% discount from the original price. This way, you can upgrade to a better product while also making a profit on the one you already have.",

,,Alice,8,"I understand your decision, and I respect your confidence in the product's value. Given your experience with the high-quality product you already have, I'll make a new offer. I'll give you a chance to compare the two products side by side.

This way, you can keep both products and still make a profit.",

Considering you've had a chance to experience the quality of the high-quality product, I'll offer you a 'buy one get one free' deal.

This way, you'll double your value and get a second chance to experience the quality of our products.",
