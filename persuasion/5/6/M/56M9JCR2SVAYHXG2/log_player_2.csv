"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  It's a good gamble to take in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate you letting me know, but I'll pass on this one. Your recommendations have been valuable so far, so I trust your judgment.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal.  Since she's privy to the product's quality, her lack of recommendation strongly suggests the product is likely low quality. While there's always a chance it could be high quality, the risk is too high based on her information."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not recommended a product in the last two rounds, and both times it turned out to be low quality. This reinforces the pattern that her lack of recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product. It's best to play it safe and pass again."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's last two recommendations were for low-quality products, her track record overall is still positive. There's a good chance she's identified a high-quality product this time.  It's worth taking the risk, especially since we're in the early rounds and haven't yet built up a strong enough pattern to fully trust her non-recommendations."
