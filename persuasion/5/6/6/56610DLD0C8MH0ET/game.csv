,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I want to assure you that I'm confident in the quality of my products, but I understand that you may have some reservations. I'd like to propose a simple test: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's the first product I've sold. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and you can decide whether to buy the next one or not. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I trust your confidence in the quality of your products and accept your offer. Let's proceed with the purchase.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on taking the leap of faith! I'm glad you're satisfied with your purchase. Now, let's move on to the next product. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold a total of 2 products so far, and you've purchased both of them. I'm willing to share with you the quality of the first product you purchased. It was a low-quality product, just like this one. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm committed to providing you with accurate information. With this in mind, I'd like to ask: are you willing to take another chance and purchase this product for $1000000?",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the transparency, Alice. Given that both products I've purchased were low-quality, I would prefer to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your honesty and commitment to accuracy.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your decision, Bob. I appreciate your cautious approach. Now, let's look at the bigger picture. Out of the 3 products I've sold so far, 2 have been low-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than the previous ones. I'd like to offer you a simple bet: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product if it's also low-quality. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of this product to you, and you can decide whether to buy the next one or not. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"Given the increased probability of the next product being high-quality and the incentive of a discount on the following product if it's low-quality, I'm willing to take this chance. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes

Given this streak, I'd like to propose a new offer: I'll give you a 75% discount on the next product if it's low-quality, and I'll also reveal the quality of the next 2 products after that. This way, you'll have more information to make an informed decision. What do you think?",

I'd like to make things right and offer you a new deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 90% discount on the next product, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a significant incentive to take a chance on the next product, and I'll have the opportunity to redeem myself. What do you say?",

This way, you'll have a clear understanding of the quality of the next 4 products, and you can make an informed decision about the next purchase. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"Thank you for the unique offer, Alice.
