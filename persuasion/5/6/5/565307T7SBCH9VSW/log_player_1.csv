* **No sales yet:** We still haven't managed to secure a single sale. 
* **Low-quality product:**  This round's product is low-quality, and recommending it would further damage our reputation and make it even harder to sell future products. 

We need to be patient and wait for another high-quality product.  We need to use those opportunities to demonstrate our value and build trust, even if it means going a few rounds without a sale.  We can't afford to risk losing potential buyers by recommending a low-quality product at this critical juncture."

* **We have no sales yet:**  This is a significant barrier to building trust with buyers.  
* **We've had a string of high-quality products:**  The last two products were high-quality, and we've been recommending them. We need to capitalize on this trend.
* **This is the final round:** There's no time to wait.  We need to take a chance and demonstrate our value.  Even if this buyer is hesitant, a single sale of a high-quality product could start to build trust and change the perception of our offerings. 

It's a gamble, but it's our best chance to get a sale and show that our products are worth the investment."
