**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that one previous buyer purchased a product, and it was high quality.  This is a small sample size, making it hard to draw firm conclusions about Alice's reliability. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a clear incentive to recommend buying, as she earns money if the product is sold, regardless of its quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward for buying a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant. Even though the odds are against us (66.67% chance of low quality), there's still a chance of a big payout. 

**Decision:**  Given the potential reward and limited information, it's worth taking the risk and buying the product."

**Explanation:**

Given the information:

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product. This is important information, as Alice knows the product's true quality.
* **Sales record:** 2 of the 2 products sold were high quality. This suggests a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality.

While there is still a chance the product is low quality, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the sales record strongly favors the product being high quality. Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product."
