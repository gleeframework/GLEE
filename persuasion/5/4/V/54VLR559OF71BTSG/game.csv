,,Alice,3,no,

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to take it, but I'm not expecting it to be."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
