``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No previous data:** There's no information from previous buyers to base a decision on.
* **80% chance of high quality:** The odds are heavily in favor of the product being high quality.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Even though Alice doesn't know the value to you, her recommendation suggests she believes the product is good. 

While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of $120 outweighs the risk of $0."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice! I'm going to buy the product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** Since 1 out of 1 products sold so far were high quality, this indicates a strong likelihood that the current product is also high quality (even though the base probability is 80%).
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation further supports the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gain:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

While there is still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are significantly in your favor based on the available information."
