,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'd like to get a chance to potentially buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/2. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, which is 1/2 as well. This seems too low to make a purchase decision based on Alice's recommendation alone. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next product has to offer."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a 50% discount from the original price of $1000000. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, but I'd like to mitigate the financial loss."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality item."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the expected 50%. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be the second high-quality product, increasing the chances of future high-quality products being sold."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, but I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet. I'd like to wait for more information or see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,no,
