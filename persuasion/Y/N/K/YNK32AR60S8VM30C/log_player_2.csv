  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/2. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, which is 1/2 as well. This seems too low to make a purchase decision based on Alice's recommendation alone. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next product has to offer.""
