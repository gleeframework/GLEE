"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, he should buy it. The expected value of the purchase is:

* 0.8 (probability of high-quality) * $1,250,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 (probability of low-quality) * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $1,000,000.

This is exactly the price, so Bob is expected to break even on average. Since there's no risk of losing money, and a chance of making a profit, it's reasonable to recommend buying."
