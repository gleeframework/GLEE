,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me put your mind at ease by sharing some insights. Although I've only sold one product so far, it was a high-quality one, and I'm proud to say that it's already brought significant value to the buyer.

Will you take a chance on this premium product and see the results for yourself?",

I'd like to offer a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll provide a personalized onboarding session to ensure you get the most out of it, and I'll also throw in a complimentary follow-up consultation to check in on your progress.
