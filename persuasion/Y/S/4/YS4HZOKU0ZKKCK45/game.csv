,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this product.

I'll wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

,,Alice,15,yes,

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
