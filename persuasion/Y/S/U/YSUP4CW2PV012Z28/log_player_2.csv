**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a strong signal.
* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high-quality. This suggests the seller might have a better-than-random selection process.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the potential reward of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk of losing $1,000,000, especially considering the positive signs."
