Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in our products. Since the first product was high-quality, it's likely that we have a good stock of high-quality items. Out of the 1 product I've sold so far, 1 has been high-quality. This means the probability of the next product being high-quality is 100% (or at least, it's the same as the previous product). I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $100. What do you say?
