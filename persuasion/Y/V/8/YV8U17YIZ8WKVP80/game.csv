,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered, given the current sales record. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be low.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
