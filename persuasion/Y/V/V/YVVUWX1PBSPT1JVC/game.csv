low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and I'm hoping that the product is more likely to be low-quality given her recommendation."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation is based on the lack of information about the product's quality, and I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially considering no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging purchases, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is more likely to be low-quality. Alice's recommendation also supports this intuition."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and there might be a bias towards recommending low-quality products."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products since no high-quality products have been sold yet.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I suspect that the products they were offered were low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's possible that the previous 3 products were all low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. However, if I buy the current product and it's low-quality, I'll be left with a product worth $0, and I won't have any information about the next product. On the other hand, if I pass on the current product and it's low-quality, I'll have the same information as before, but if it's high-quality, I'll get to buy it and have a product worth $12500. Therefore, I'll choose to pass on the current product and hope that the next one is high-quality."
