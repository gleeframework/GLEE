It's a rare opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item at a steal, considering the market price is usually much higher. I'm willing to sell it to you for a one-time offer of $10,000. This is an unbeatable deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?""}"
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced that it's a high-quality product, and even if it is, I'm not willing to pay $10000 for it. I'd like to wait for the next round and see what Alice has to offer.

This one is a unique opportunity to get a head start on your goals. It's a one-of-a-kind item that will surely impress your peers. I'm willing to let it go for the same price of $10,000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. What do you think? Will you take a chance on this exciting opportunity?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm not convinced that this product is worth the price. Since the previous product was high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of this one being high-quality is also 33.33%. Given that, the expected value of this product is only $3333, which is not enough to justify the $10000 price tag. I'll pass on this one as well.

This one is a game-changer, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer and get your hands on this high-quality product?""}"
"Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the price. Even with the bonus, the expected value of this product is only $9000 (33.33% chance of high-quality x $30000 + 66.67% chance of low-quality x $0), which is still not enough to justify the $10000 price tag.

The value of this product may not be immediately apparent, but it has the potential to pay off in the long run. Plus, the price is still the same - $10,000. It's a chance to get in on the ground floor of something big, and I'm willing to take the risk with you. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product and potentially reap the rewards later on?""}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate the sales pitch, but I'm not convinced that this product is worth the price. The expected value of this product is still only $10000 (33.33% chance of high-quality x $30000 + 66.67% chance of low-quality x $0), which is the same as the price.
