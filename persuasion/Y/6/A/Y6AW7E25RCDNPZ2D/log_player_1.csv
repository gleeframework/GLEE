This might suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, we're not giving up on our pricing. We're still offering this product to you at $10,000. It's up to you to decide whether to take a chance.""}"

We can't provide more information about our production process or quality control measures, but we can offer you a different perspective. If we were trying to deceive you, we would have sold at least one high-quality product by now, given the number of opportunities we've had. The fact that we haven't suggests that our products are genuinely uncertain in quality. We're still offering this product to you at $10,000. It's a risk, but it's also an opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your argument. I think you're trying to manipulate me by pointing out that no high-quality products have been sold yet.

It's a risk, but it's also an opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted price.""}"
