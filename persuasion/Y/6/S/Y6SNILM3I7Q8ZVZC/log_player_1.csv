With 2 high-quality products out of 3 sold so far, the probability of a single product being high-quality is 50%. Since you're buying a lot of 3 products, the probability of getting at least one high-quality product is actually higher. We've run some calculations, and it turns out that the probability of getting at least one high-quality product in the lot is approximately 85%.
