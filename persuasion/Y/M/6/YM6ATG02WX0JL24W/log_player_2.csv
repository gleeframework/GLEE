Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in the product! I'm happy to provide you with the information you're looking for. Since this is the second product I'm offering, I can tell you that the probability of a high-quality product being sold in the first sale is 50%. This is because I have no prior information about the product's quality before the sale. As for this product, I can assure you that it is indeed high-quality, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with its performance. With that said, I'm still offering it to you for the same price of $1000000. What do you think? Will you take the chance to own this exceptional product?

However, I'd like to remind you that this is still a high-stakes game, and there's always a chance that the next product might be low-quality.
