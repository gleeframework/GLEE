low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which might suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice recommended it.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous two buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to get a better sense of the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm curious to see the next product and the updated statistics before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I'd rather not take the risk. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that this product is high quality given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales record so far?"

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm starting to think that your recommendations are actually based on the quality of the product. If the product were high-quality, I would expect at least one of the previous buyers to have bought it. Therefore, I'm going to pass on this product."
