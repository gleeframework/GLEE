,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $100. I'm aware that it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to let it go for this price. If you're interested, please let me know, and you'll get it for $100. If not, I'll just move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $100, I'm waiting for a high-quality product.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a high-quality product. I'm glad I have one available now. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm confident you'll find it worth the price, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you at this price, given the 80% chance it's actually high-quality.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the product. I'm willing to pay $100 for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $300 to me.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you were satisfied with the previous purchase! I have another high-quality product available, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I want to give you a bit more information this time. I'll tell you that the previous product you bought was indeed the first high-quality one I had, and I've had a chance to inspect this new one. I'm even more confident that this one is high-quality, and I think you'll find it's worth more than the previous one. So, I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still only willing to pay $100 for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $300 to me. I'll take my chances.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're sticking to your strategy. I'll give you another piece of information to consider. Since you've already bought two high-quality products from me, I'll offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. This way, you'll only risk $100, and you'll get a high-quality product or your money back. I think this is a fair deal, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I don't think it changes the expected value for me. The product still has a 20% chance of being low-quality, which means I'd lose $100. I'm not willing to take on that risk for a product that's only worth $300 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision to be cautious. However, I want to offer you a different perspective. Since you've already passed on two high-quality products, I'm willing to give you a'second chance' deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 'credit' that you can use towards a future purchase of a high-quality product. The credit will be worth $150, which is more than the $100 you'd pay for this low-quality product. This way, you can essentially'save' $50 and still have the opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a later time.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a credit that's worth $150. I'm only willing to pay $100 for a product that's worth at least $300 to me, and this offer doesn't change that.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're still looking for a high-quality product worth at least $300 to you. I'll make a counteroffer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $80, which is a discount from the original $100 price. This way, you'll get a high-quality product that meets your minimum value threshold, and you'll also get a better deal than before.",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the product. I'm willing to pay $80 for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $300 to me.,yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! I want to continue offering you a good deal on this high-quality product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80 again. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $90, which is a 10% discount from the original $100 price. I think this is a fair price, considering the 80% chance of it being worth $300 to you.",
,,Bob,7,"I already bought a high-quality product for $80, so I'm not interested in paying $90 for another one. I'll wait for a new product to be offered.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand you're not interested in paying more for a high-quality product. However, I want to remind you that you still have the $150 credit from the previous'second chance' offer. If you buy this low-quality product, you'll get the credit, which is worth more than the $100 you'd pay for this product. Plus, you'll still have the opportunity to buy a high-quality product at a later time. I think this is a good chance for you to'save' $50 and get a good deal.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with the credit. I'd rather wait for a new high-quality product to be offered.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand you're still waiting for a high-quality product. I'll make a new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for the same price as the last one, which is $90. However, I'll throw in an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that I'll offer you another high-quality product at a discount (at least 10% off) in the next round. This way, you'll get a good deal on this product and a potential future discount on another high-quality product.",

,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! As promised, I have another high-quality product available. I'll sell it to you for the same price as before, $90, but this time I'll give you an even better deal. I'll give you a 15% discount, so the price will be $77.50. I think this is a great deal, considering the 80% chance of it being worth $300 to you.",

I'll give you a 20% discount on this high-quality product, making the price $80. But that's not all - I'll also give you a 'priority access' to the next high-quality product that comes up. You'll get to buy it at the same price as the previous one, without any additional discounts or negotiations. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a good deal and secure a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,11,"I'll take the product. The 20% discount brings the price down to a point where I'm willing to pay for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $300 to me, and the priority access to the next high-quality product is a nice bonus.",yes

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As promised, I have a high-quality product available, and you get to buy it at the same price as the last one, $80. But I'll also give you an additional incentive: I'll throw in a 'price match guarantee' for the next high-quality product. If I offer a high-quality product at a lower price in the next round, you'll get to buy it at that price instead of the original $80. This way, you'll get the best deal possible on the next high-quality product.",

Since you've bought five high-quality products from me, I'll give you a 'VIP deal'. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $70, which is a 30% discount from the original price. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at an unbeatable price.",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take the product. The 30% discount brings the price down to a point where I'm willing to pay for a product with an 80% chance of being worth $300 to me, and I'm not expecting to get a better deal than this.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I have to inform you that this product is not high-quality. I know you're not interested in low-quality products, and I respect that. Since you've already bought six high-quality products from me, I want to give you a 'consolation prize'. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a $20 credit that you can use towards a future purchase. This way, you'll get something in return, even if you're not getting a high-quality product.",

I want to remind you that you have the 'price match guarantee' from the last purchase, which means you'll get the best price on the next high-quality product. I'll sell you this high-quality product for the same price as the last one, $70. However, I'll also give you a 'final offer' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a $50 credit that you can use towards a future purchase, on top of the price match guarantee. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for you.",

high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I have to inform you that this is actually Round 17, not the last round. I made a mistake earlier. You still have 3 more rounds left. I'll sell you this high-quality product for the same price as the last one, $70. But I'll also give you a 'bonus' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 5% chance to win a mystery prize, which could be a high-quality product at a discounted price, a credit, or even a free product. This is a unique opportunity, and I think it's worth considering.",
