  ""message"": ""You've already taken a chance on a low-quality product for $1000000. I want to emphasize that the next product could be high-quality, which might be worth significantly more to you. I'm willing to offer you a'safety net' - if you buy this next product and it's also low-quality, I'll give you a refund of $500000. This way, you'll be out $500000 instead of $1000000. What do you say?""

This way, you'll have a lower risk of a large loss, and you'll still have a chance to buy a potentially high-quality product at a lower price. What do you say?""
}"

However, I want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'll offer you a simple message: if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed description of its features and specifications. If it's high-quality, this might help you appreciate its value.

  ""message"": ""You've received the detailed description of the last product, but unfortunately, it's another low-quality one. I'll offer you a new perspective: think about the value of having a collection of products, even if they're not all high-quality. Maybe you can use them for parts, or sell them to someone else. I'll give you a'bundle deal': if you buy this next product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of this product, and I'll also throw in a free 'upgrade' on the next product you buy. What do you say?""

I'm not sure how much longer I'll be offering such good deals. This product is low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a very low price: $750000. It's a steal, and I think you'd be making a mistake to pass on it. What do you say?""
