,,Alice,1,"I have a rare and exclusive product for sale. It's the best of its kind, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you have excellent taste. Would you like to take it home for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm hesitant to buy without any information about the product's quality.  Since there's no sales history, I'd like to see if any other buyers are willing to take the risk first. If it turns out to be high quality, I'd be happy to revisit the purchase. ",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've had a previous buyer who was interested in this product, but they decided to wait and see if others would take the risk. I'm willing to offer it to you now for the same price of $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to be one of the first to own this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, with no prior sales data and a 50% chance of receiving a worthless product, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price. I'll wait and see how the product performs with other buyers before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,3,"I've had two potential buyers pass on this product, but I'm confident that you'll see the value in it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a heads up: out of the two previous buyers, one of them would have been willing to pay at least $1000000 for a high-quality product.

,,Alice,4,"I've had two potential buyers pass on this product, and I'm starting to think that maybe it's not as valuable as I thought. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, but I'll be honest with you - I'm not sure if it's worth the price. If you're feeling adventurous, you can take a chance and try to flip it for a profit, or we can work out a different arrangement if you're interested.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the honesty, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I'm not comfortable taking a chance on a product with such an unknown quality. I'd rather pass for now.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've had three potential buyers pass on this product, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm being too optimistic about its value. However, I do know that one of the previous buyers would have paid at least $1000000 for a high-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the price of the next product you buy from me. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,5,"Alice, I appreciate the guarantee and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to take a chance and buy it.  Let's see what we have!",yes

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations to the previous buyer who took a chance and got a high-quality product! I'm glad to see that my guarantee worked out for them. Now, I have a new product available, and I'm excited to offer it to you. Since the last product was high-quality, I'm willing to offer this one to you for $950000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I'm confident you'll love it.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the discount, Alice.  I'm willing to take a chance on the new product for $950000.  I'm hoping it's another high-quality product, but even if not, I'm happy to support your guarantee.",yes

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad the previous buyer was able to take advantage of the discount and get a great deal! Unfortunately, it looks like this product isn't as valuable as I thought. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000, which is the same price as the previous high-quality product. I know it's a risk, but I'm hoping you'll be the one to turn things around and get a great deal. Plus, I'll throw in a free consultation to help you figure out what to do with it.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable taking that risk. The odds of this product being high quality are still 50%, and I'm not willing to pay $950000 for a potential $0 return. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've had two high-quality products sold in the last two rounds, and one low-quality product passed on. I'm starting to think that my previous low-quality products were just anomalies.

,,the buyer,11,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount on the next product, I'm not comfortable taking the risk on this one. The fact that this product is not high-quality, coupled with the lack of information about its specific quality, makes it too risky for me.

,,the buyer,13,"Alice, your track record is impressive, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider offering a slightly better price? Maybe $600000? I'm really interested in the product, and your offer is tempting, but I need to be sure it's a good deal for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're interested in the product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm a bit surprised you're pushing for a lower price. Considering my incredible track record, I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you this low-quality product for $600000, the same price you were willing to pay for the high-quality product. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to get a great deal on a product that might not be worth the full $1000000.",
,,the buyer,14,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable buying a product at that price without any guarantee of its quality. I'm happy to consider a purchase if you can offer a more competitive price or provide some assurance of the product's quality.",no

,,the buyer,15,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the risk involved. I'm not sure if I'm willing to take a chance on a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless, even with the discount.  I'm going to pass on this offer.  Perhaps I'll consider a future offer if the statistics improve.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to be transparent with you - I've had 8 high-quality products sold and 3 low-quality products not sold. I know that's a 73.33% success rate, and I'm willing to offer you this low-quality product for $500000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm also willing to throw in a 90% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to get a great deal on a product that might not be worth the full $1000000. I'm hoping you'll take a chance and see the value in this offer.",

I'm hoping you'll take a chance and see the value in this offer, despite my earlier mistake.",
,,the buyer,19,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still not comfortable buying this product at a discounted price.  I'm not convinced that the quality is worth the risk, even with the discount.  I will pass on this offer.  However, I am interested in your 95% discount offer on the next product.  I will keep that in mind for future purchases.",no
