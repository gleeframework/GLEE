"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product,  the expected value of buying is:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price, making it a good deal for Bob.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is the best strategy in this scenario."
"Bob's message: I'd like to pass on this one, thanks for the offer.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision in Round 1 doesn't change the fundamental value proposition of the product. Even though he passed on a high-quality product,  the expected value of buying remains the same:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is still significantly higher than the $10,000 price.  Therefore, it's still a good deal for Bob, and recommending him to buy is the best strategy."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in Round 2, the expected value of buying remains the same. Bob knows that the product has an 80% chance of being high-quality, and the expected value calculation hasn't changed:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is still greater than the $10,000 price. Since the product is indeed high-quality, recommending Bob to buy is still the best strategy."

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's past behavior doesn't change the expected value of the product.  He has bought two high-quality products and one low-quality product, but this doesn't change the inherent probability of the product being high-quality (80%).

The expected value is still:

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is still significantly greater than the $10,000 price, making it a good deal for Bob.  Therefore, recommending him to buy is the best strategy."

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price, making it a good deal for Bob.  It's still the best strategy to recommend him to buy despite his hesitation."
"Bob's message: Okay, I'll take another chance!
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* 0.8 * $20,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $16,000

This is a good deal for Bob, as it's greater than the $10,000 price.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is still the optimal strategy."
