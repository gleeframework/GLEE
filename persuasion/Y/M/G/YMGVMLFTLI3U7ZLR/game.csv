,,Alice,1,"This is our first product, and I'm excited to offer it to you. I'm confident that you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've had a great track record with my previous sales, and I'm looking forward to continuing that streak. Will you make me an offer or buy it for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the product for $100. I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I don't have any information about its quality yet.,yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to our second product! I'm glad to report that we've had a successful sale already, and I'm confident that this one will be just as good. I'd like to highlight that the product we sold earlier was of high quality, and I'm proud to say that this one is also of high quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I think it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Since the first product was also of high quality, I'm worried that I might be getting another high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for more information.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put it this way: we've had one successful sale so far, but that doesn't necessarily mean the next one will be high-quality. In fact, we've had a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product from the start, and the first sale could have been a fluke. This product is available for $100, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,3,"I understand your point, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still cautious about the uncertainty of the product's quality. I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality. Please let me know the outcome.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a bold one, I like that! Unfortunately, the product we sold earlier was low-quality, just like this one. We're 0 for 2 now, and I think it's clear that we're not on a hot streak. In fact, it's starting to look like we're having a bit of a slump. Would you like to take a chance on us and buy this product for $100, or do you think we need to prove ourselves a bit more?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your sales record so far, and I don't want to take a chance on a low-quality product. I'd like to see a better track record before considering a purchase.",no

,,Alice,5,"I don't blame you for being cautious, and I appreciate your honesty. I want to be upfront with you: we're 0 for 3 now, and it's clear that we need to turn things around. I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $80. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to get a good deal on a product that might be high-quality. What do you think?",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth the risk. I'd like to wait and see if you can improve your sales record before making a decision.",no
