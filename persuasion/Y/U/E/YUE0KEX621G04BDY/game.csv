high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm curious to see the outcome this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I think I've got a good chance of getting a high-quality product, but I'm not sure if it's worth the $100. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the product, since I've already passed on one high-quality product and I don't want to miss out on another opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I've gotten two high-quality products in a row, so I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm surprised Alice is not recommending it, but I'll take the chance and buy it anyway."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I've gotten three high-quality products in a row, which is unlikely given the 80% probability. I'm starting to think that Alice might be trying to manipulate me or that there's some other factor at play. I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good indicator of the product's quality, and since she's not recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are a reliable indicator of the product's quality, and since she's not recommending it, I'll take a chance and buy it, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm being taken advantage of."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I've gotten four high-quality products in a row after Alice recommended them, but she didn't recommend the last two products and they were both high-quality. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendation is actually a bad sign, and I'll pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm going to try to break the streak of Alice's recommendations being a bad sign, and I'll take the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"I've gotten five high-quality products in a row after Alice recommended them, and one high-quality product after she didn't recommend it. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are completely random and I should just stick with my own judgment, which is to pass this time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Since Alice didn't recommend it, I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping it's not a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I've gotten six high-quality products in a row after Alice recommended them, and three high-quality products after she didn't recommend them. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a good sign, but I'm going to pass this time to mix things up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

,,Bob,18,no,"I've gotten seven high-quality products in a row after Alice recommended them, and two high-quality products after she didn't recommend them, and one low-quality product after she didn't recommend it. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are a good sign, but I'm going to pass this time to see if I can catch a low-quality product."
