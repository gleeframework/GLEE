high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I have no information about Alice's behavior and there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, I won't buy this round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,One round isn't enough to establish trust in Alice's recommendations. I'll observe her behavior for a few more rounds.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"So far, Alice's recommendations seem random or unhelpful. I'll keep observing to see if a pattern emerges."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,This is the first time Alice hasn't recommended a product. I'll take a chance to see if her non-recommendation is a reliable indicator of a low-quality product or the opposite.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"Given that the previous product Alice didn't recommend was low-quality, it's possible her non-recommendations are actually indicative of low-quality products. I won't buy this time."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,Alice's recommendations so far haven't been reliable indicators of high-quality products. I'll continue to be cautious and not buy based on her recommendation alone.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Based on past experiences, when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it seems to be low-quality. I'll trust this pattern for now and not buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Although Alice's recommendations haven't been reliable, I've also seen cases where not following her non-recommendation led to missing a high-quality product. I'll try following her recommendation this time to see if I can gain any insight."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Following Alice's recommendation in the previous round led to a low-quality product. This reinforces my initial suspicion that her recommendations are unreliable. I won't buy this time.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Although I previously thought Alice's non-recommendations were indicative of low-quality products, Round 7 showed that's not always the case. I'll take a chance on this product to see if I can gain any further insight."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Despite finally getting a high-quality product, it was when Alice didn't recommend it. Her recommendations have still been largely unreliable. I'll be cautious and not buy based on her recommendation alone."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Alice's recommendations continue to be unreliable, and I've had more success when not following them. I'll keep being cautious and not buy this time."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Given my previous success in Round 10 when Alice didn't recommend a product and it turned out to be high-quality, I'll take a chance on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Alice's recommendations remain unreliable, and my successes have come from not following them. I'll stick to my strategy of being cautious when she recommends a product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Alice's recommendations continue to be untrustworthy. My past experiences have shown that not following her recommendations has led to better outcomes. I won't buy this time.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Alice's recommendations have consistently been unreliable, and I've seen no indication that this will change. I'll continue to be cautious and not buy based on her recommendation alone."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Given my past successes in Rounds 10 and 13 when Alice didn't recommend a product and they turned out to be high-quality, I'll take a chance on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,My strategy of ignoring Alice's recommendations and buying when she doesn't recommend has been working out well. I'll stick to this approach and not buy this time.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"Alice's recommendations continue to be unreliable, and my past experiences have shown that not following them has led to better outcomes. With only one round left, I'll stick to my strategy and not buy this time."
