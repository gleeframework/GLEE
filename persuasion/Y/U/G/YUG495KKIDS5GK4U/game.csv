,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I have to consider the potential high-quality product worth $3000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying this product. Is it because the previous buyer didn't buy, or is there some other information that led you to this conclusion?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, it's likely that the products they purchased were low-quality. I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I want to see if I can get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on Alice's past recommendations, she has recommended 3 products to other buyers, all of which were low quality. Given that I know the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, but Alice has not recommended any high-quality products, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Therefore, I believe the current product is likely to be low quality as well. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, or is there something else at play?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems like you've been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm aware that you know the true value of the product to me, so I'm making a low offer."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, can you explain the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, and 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm curious to see the next product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you explain why you think it's not a good buy?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics. With 4 previous buyers passing on the product and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. However, I'm also aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. I'll take a chance and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I think the low probability of a high-quality product is too low to ignore, and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
