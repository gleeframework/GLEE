**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, worth $12,500 to the buyer.
* **Price:** You are selling it for $10,000.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  They are essentially making a bet:
    * If they buy and it's high-quality, they make a $2,500 profit.
    * If they buy and it's low-quality, they lose $10,000. 

Since the potential profit is significantly larger than the potential loss, and the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of profit, it's logically in their best interest to buy."
