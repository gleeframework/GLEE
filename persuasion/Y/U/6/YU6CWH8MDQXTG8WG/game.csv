low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,"Out of the 17 previous rounds, I have recommended buying 8 times, but only 2 of the bought products were actually high-quality. The overall sales record shows that 3 high-quality products were sold out of 8 products sold. Please make your decision based on this information."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm also considering the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product out of 5 sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,"Out of the 19 previous rounds, I have recommended buying 8 times, but only 2 of the bought products were actually high-quality. The overall sales record shows that 3 high-quality products were sold out of 8 products sold. I'm recommending not to buy this product because, despite the 50% initial probability, the actual sales record shows a lower success rate, and I don't want you to make a decision based solely on the initial probability. Please consider this information when making your decision."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is low?
