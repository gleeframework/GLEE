Round 2
Alice's message: I've got a new offer for you. This product is not as valuable as the previous one, but it's still a good deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Think of it as a 'loss leader' to get you to come back for more. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-value product, I'll pass.""}"

It's a'mystery product' that could be worth anywhere from $0 to $40000. I'm only offering it to you because I think you have a good instinct for these things.

Round 9

Since you got the previous high-quality product for $7500, I'll give you the same deal: 25% off the price, so you'll pay $7500 again. But here's the thing: if you buy this product, I'll also throw in a chance to buy the next product at the same price as the one you just got, which is $5000. It's a 'two for the price of one' deal.
