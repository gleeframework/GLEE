You should still recommend the buyer *not* to buy the product. Even though the buyer purchased the product in the previous round, this doesn't change the fact that the product is likely to be low quality. The buyer's decision was based on a lack of information, and the seller is obligated to be transparent.  

You should continue to recommend against purchasing the product until you have a track record of selling high-quality products. This will build trust with buyers and increase the chances of future sales."
