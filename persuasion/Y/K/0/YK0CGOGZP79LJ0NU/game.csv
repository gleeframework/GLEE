,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold first, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information about the product's quality, and I'd like to see the results of previous sales to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the results of the first few sales to get a better sense of the proportion of high-quality products."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. Can you provide more information about the product's quality and the sales record?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that only one high-quality product has been sold out of one, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that the previous buyer bought it based on Alice's recommendation makes me think that Alice might be biased towards recommending high-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if Alice will recommend it to the next buyer."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 out of 1 product sold was high-quality, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'll wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since I have access to the statistics. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, it seems like the probability of a low-quality product is still relatively high."
