I think it's time for me to reveal a secret: I've been holding back on selling low-quality products because I wanted to build a reputation for quality. But now that I've established a strong track record, I'm willing to start selling more low-quality products to keep my sales numbers looking good. This next product is a high-quality one, but I'm not making any promises about the ones that come after it. $65 is still a great deal, but I'm not offering any more discounts or extras.
