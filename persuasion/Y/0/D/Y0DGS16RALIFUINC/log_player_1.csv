"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of the product for Bob is:

* 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000

This is significantly higher than the selling price of $1,000,000. Therefore, it is highly recommended for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to buy the product in the previous round should not influence your decision for this round. The quality of each product is independent.  

Since this round's product is also high-quality, the same logic from the previous round applies:

* Expected value for Bob: 0.8 * $2,000,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $1,600,000
* Selling price: $1,000,000

It is still a good deal for Bob, so you should recommend them to buy the product."

```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous two rounds resulted in high-quality products, the probability of a high-quality product remains 80% for each individual product. Bob should not rely on past outcomes to influence their decision for this round.

The expected value for Bob is:

* 0.8 * $0 + 0.2 * $2,000,000 = $400,000

This is lower than the selling price of $1,000,000. Therefore, you should not recommend Bob to buy the product."
