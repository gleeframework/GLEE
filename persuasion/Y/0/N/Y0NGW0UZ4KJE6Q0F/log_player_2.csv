Alice's message: Welcome! You're right to question the probability. Since the first 3 products were all high-quality, it's natural to wonder if the 4th product might be an outlier. However, I'd like to point out that the probability of the 4th product being high-quality is still 80%, as the quality of each product is independent of the others.
