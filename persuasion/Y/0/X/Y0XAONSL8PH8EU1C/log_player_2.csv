Alice's message: Hello! This is a rare opportunity to buy a product that I believe will bring significant value to you. I'm excited to start my sales journey and I'm confident that I can offer high-quality products. I assure you that I will be transparent and honest in my dealings. Don't miss out on this chance to get a great product for $100. Buy now and see the value for yourself!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Since there are no previous sales records, I'll have to rely on the 50% chance of the product being high quality. Given the product's value to me is either $300 or $0, the expected value is $150. However, the asking price is $100, which is lower than the expected value. But I still can't be sure if the product is of high quality. I'll pass on this one to gather more data on your sales record.""}"
