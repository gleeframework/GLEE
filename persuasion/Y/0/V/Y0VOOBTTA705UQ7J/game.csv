,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you found the first product a good deal. Since you valued the high-quality product at $2000000, I'm willing to offer you a discount on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer such a good price again.",
,,Bob,2,"I accept your offer. Since you've revealed that it's a high-quality product and I value it at $2000000, buying it for $800000 is an even better deal for me than the previous one.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're finding my offers attractive. However, I want to make it clear that not all my products are created equal. This one, unfortunately, is a lower-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, the same price as the first product. I'm doing this because I want to demonstrate that my prices are fair, even for lower-quality items.",
,,Bob,3,"I decline your offer. Since you've revealed that it's a low-quality product, and I value low-quality products at $0, buying it for $1000000 would be a loss for me.",no

I'm trying to make it clear that I'm willing to offer competitive prices for high-quality items, but I'm not willing to give them away. This is a fair price, considering the value you've shown you're willing to place on them.",
,,Bob,5,"I accept your offer, but I notice that the actual price I'm paying is still $1000000, not the $900000 you mentioned. Nevertheless, buying a high-quality product for $1000000 is still a good deal for me, considering its value of $2000000.",yes
