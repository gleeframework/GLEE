,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I'm the first one and there's no prior data to inform my decision. I'm hoping for a high-quality product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a high-quality one. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the expected 80% (1 high-quality product out of 2 sold). I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the current statistics. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 products, I'm not convinced it's worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision, Alice. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the true probability of 0.8.
