,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get a better sense of the distribution of high and low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. If it's low-quality, I'd like to know that I'm not the only one who didn't follow Alice's recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share the probability with me?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all the previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still relatively high. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm leaning towards the product being low-quality. I'd like to pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the low probability of a high-quality product being sold, and not because of your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that they were all low-quality products. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on this product to see if the next buyer will get a high-quality one."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and all of them passed, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products is higher than 33.33%."

,,Alice,17,yes,
