,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not buying this one. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still high, but I've already gotten two high-quality products in a row, which is unusual. I'll pass and see if the next one is high-quality."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I know I passed on the last one, but I've already missed two high-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%. I'll take the chance."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I've missed two high-quality products in a row, and I'm still facing a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,no,"Alice's recommendation to not buy this product was correct, and it turned out to be low-quality. I'm starting to think that she's trying to help me avoid wasting money on low-quality products. I'll trust her judgment and pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

,,Bob,12,no,"I've gotten back on track with a high-quality product, but I'm still wary of Alice's motives. I'll pass on this one and see what happens next."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I've missed another high-quality product, and I'm starting to think that I should just trust Alice's recommendations. She's been right so far when she doesn't recommend buying, and I've been right when I take her advice. I'll buy this one."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I've missed another high-quality product, and I'm starting to think that I should just go with the odds. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
