Alice's message: You're in luck! I'm offering a unique opportunity to own a product that has a 80% chance of being high-quality. With 1 out of 5 products sold so far being high-quality, the odds are in your favor. Trust me, this product is worth the investment. Are you ready to take the chance? The price is $1000000, a steal considering the potential return. What do you say? Will you take the leap?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: Ahah, congratulations to the previous buyer! Now, let's talk about this new product. With 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold so far, the proportion of high-quality products is now 100%! This is a strong indication that my products are indeed high-quality. I'm willing to share this information with you, but I'm also aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, not 100%. This means there's still a 20% chance it's low-quality.

Since 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been high-quality, the proportion of high-quality products is now 100%!
