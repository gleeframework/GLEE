,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not influenced by your recommendation. I'll make my own decision based on the 50/50 chance of it being high or low quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer and you recommended against it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended and both turned out to be low-quality, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to wait for a more neutral or high-quality product recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or consider buying a product that has not been recommended."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics and would like to take my chances."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the products before me, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you have any more to offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products, as well as the total number of products that have been offered so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers were not just getting lucky with low-quality products. I want to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 5 products, I suspect that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
