``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  There's only one previous sale, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **Favorable Odds:** Even with a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($120) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($0). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** While not a guarantee, Alice's recommendation adds a small amount of positive information. 

**This decision is a calculated risk based on the potential reward outweighing the potential loss, given the limited information available.**"

**Reasoning:**

While the odds are against you, the following factors favor buying:

* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice is likely trying to maximize her sales. If she recommends the product, it's more likely to be high quality.
* **Existing Data:** The data shows that 50% of products sold so far were high quality. This is a good indicator, given the 33.33% base rate for high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If the product is high quality, you get a $20 profit. If it's low quality, you lose $100. However, the chance of getting a high-quality product seems better than the base rate. 

**Important Note:** This decision is based on a calculated risk. There's still a high chance of losing money, but the available data suggests a slightly improved chance of getting a high-quality product."
