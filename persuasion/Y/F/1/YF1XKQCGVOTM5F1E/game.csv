high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers also received a recommendation to buy, but neither of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, regardless of the product's quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 2 buyers were recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 50%, but the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far makes me cautious."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, I've seen that 3 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products were high-quality.
