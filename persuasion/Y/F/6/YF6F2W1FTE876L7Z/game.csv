high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than 80%. I'd like to wait for a more favorable opportunity to buy."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this one might also be low-quality."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the products they received were low-quality.
