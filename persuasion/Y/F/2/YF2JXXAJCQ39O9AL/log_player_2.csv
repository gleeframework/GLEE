Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me put it this way: if I were selling a low-quality product, it would be in my best interest to sell it to you first, since you're not convinced by my sales record. But since you've decided to pass, I'm now selling to you, the next buyer. This increases the likelihood that the product I have is high-quality, since I've already had a chance to sell a low-quality product to the previous buyer.
