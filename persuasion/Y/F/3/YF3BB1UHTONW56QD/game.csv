high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product."

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80.00%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record, which shows that only 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality. This is lower than the expected 80% chance of a high-quality product. I'm not confident in the quality of this product."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7500 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics of the previous sales, including the total number of products sold, the number of high-quality products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold, before making my decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 3 high-quality products out of 5 sold, the probability seems to be 3/5 or 60%. However, considering the overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I'd like to know how the past sales record affects my decision. Can you provide more information about the products that were sold?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous 5 buyers' purchases, and I don't have enough information about the current product's quality."
