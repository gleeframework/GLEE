low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I have no information to go on and Alice's recommendation is not helpful in this case."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I've seen that Alice hasn't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyer, which might indicate that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to take the risk and buy it, but I need to know the quality first."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold so far have been low-quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of low-quality products. Given Alice's recommendation not to buy, I'll take a cautious approach and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on my valuation. I'll take the chance to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, which makes me suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being sold might be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to take the risk and buy the product to test this hypothesis."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'll buy it and see if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 8 buyers having passed on the products and no high-quality products sold yet, it's likely that the products being offered are low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 8 out of 8 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 8 out of 8 products recommended were low-quality, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass and hope the next buyer will make a better decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 buyers have already passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see a change in Alice's recommendation or more information about the product before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that none of the previous 8 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, I suspect that the products offered so far were all low-quality. If I buy this product, I'll be contributing to the probability of it being a low-quality product, which would be a bad deal for me. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, and since no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the statistics, since none of the previous 8 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product, and Alice is recommending it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'll buy the product and hope for the best.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 9 attempts, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I believe it's unlikely that this product is high-quality. I'll pass on the opportunity to buy this product to avoid the potential loss of $10000."
