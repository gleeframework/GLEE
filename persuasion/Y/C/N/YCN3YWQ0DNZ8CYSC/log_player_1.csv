"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I know the product is high-quality. Given the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of the purchase is:

* 0.8 * $1,250,000 (high-quality value) + 0.2 * $0 (low-quality value) = $1,000,000

The expected value is equal to the selling price. Since the buyer is risk-neutral, they should be indifferent to buying or not buying.  However, in this scenario, it's advantageous for me to recommend the purchase as I know the product is high-quality."
