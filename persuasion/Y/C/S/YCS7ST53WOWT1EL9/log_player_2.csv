**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the fact that Alice recommends it *and* the previous buyer purchased it strongly suggests it's likely high quality. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the risk, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $0. 
* **Limited Information:**  There's not enough data to calculate a precise probability of the product being high quality. However, the information we have points towards a favorable outcome.

**Note:** This decision assumes a risk-neutral or slightly risk-seeking approach. A more risk-averse buyer might choose to pass."
