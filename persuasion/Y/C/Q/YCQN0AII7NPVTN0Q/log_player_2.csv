Alice's message: You're the second buyer I've had so far, and I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products. I'm offering you this one for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%. If you buy it, you'll be doubling down on the fact that the first product I sold was high-quality, which might suggest that I'm on a hot streak. On the other hand, if you don't buy it, you'll be getting a better sense of the distribution of product qualities. What do you think?

Alice's message: The first product I sold was indeed a high-quality product from the start. It wasn't upgraded or reconditioned in any way. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, just like the last one. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. I'm curious, are you willing to take a chance on this one?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer! You're right, the fact that the first product was high-quality might suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. However, it's also possible that it was just a lucky draw. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far, which is a bit higher than expected. But, I'm still a long way from reaching my goal of selling 20 products. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000.

I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, and I want you to know that it's a genuine opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I think it's worth noting that the odds of getting a high-quality product in a row are a bit lower than that. What do you think?

Given that 4 out of 6 products were high-quality, the probability of a high-quality product is actually 66.67% (4/6).
