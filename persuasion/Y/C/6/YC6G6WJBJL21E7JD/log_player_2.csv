Round 2
Alice's message: I see you're not interested in the deal, but I'm curious - are you looking for a high-quality product? If so, I can offer you a special deal on a product that I think you'll really like. But if you're open to a low-quality product, I can let you have this one for the same price of $10000. It's a steal!
