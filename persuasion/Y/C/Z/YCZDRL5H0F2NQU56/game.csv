I've sold 5 high-quality products in a row, but the probability of this happening by chance is still 32.64% (I've done the math). I'm offering you this product for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and make it yours?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product, but I'm also aware that the probability of this being a hot streak is still relatively low. I'd like to take a chance and see if I can get lucky.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,

I'm offering you this product for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and make it yours?",

I've sold 6 high-quality products in a row, but that's not a guarantee of future results. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering you this product for $1000000. Would you like to take a chance and make it yours?",
