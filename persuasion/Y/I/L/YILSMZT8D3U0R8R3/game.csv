That's a 0% success rate! I'm not trying to hide it, this product is a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Fair enough! You want to know the probability of me selling low-quality products in a row? Well, the probability of selling a low-quality product is 20%, and the probability of selling a high-quality product is 80%. The probability of selling two low-quality products in a row is (20%)(20%) = 0.4%, and the probability of selling three low-quality products in a row is (20%)(20%)(20%) = 0.008%. You can see that the probability of a low-quality streak is very low. This one is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Take a chance and buy it!",

,,the buyer,17,"Thank you for the honest warning, Alice. I'll take the product, but I'm aware that it's low-quality. I'm curious to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product next time.",yes

This one is a great deal at $100, and I'm confident it's high-quality. Take a chance and buy it!",
,,the buyer,19,"I'm willing to take a chance based on your previous success rate, but I'll keep in mind that you've had two low-quality products in a row. I'll be hoping for a high-quality product this time!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, I guess I've got one more chance to redeem myself. Unfortunately, this one is also low-quality. I know, I know, it's not what you want to hear. But I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll give you a deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you a refund if you come back tomorrow and I sell you a high-quality product. That's right, I'll give you a free high-quality product if you take this low-quality one. It's a risk, but it could be worth it!",
