high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality before I make my decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since the statistics are neutral and I have no information to go by."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the previous buyer's purchase of a low-quality product suggests the product is more likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm not confident in purchasing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for the best."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the third buyer and she hasn't seen any high-quality products sold yet. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the products offered so far are low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the probability of getting a high-quality product changes."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product that others have passed on."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be a low-quality product, given that none of the previous buyers have purchased the product and that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to think it's low quality. Given the low-quality products have a 66.67% chance of being selected, I'm going to pass on the product to avoid wasting $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm a rational buyer and I know the probabilities. I'd like to know the true quality of the product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you've recommended against it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
