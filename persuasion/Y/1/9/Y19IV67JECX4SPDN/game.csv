,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I'm the first one and I don't have any prior information to go off of. I'm essentially taking a shot in the dark.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're the second buyer. I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, just like the one you didn't have any information about. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Considering I've already sold one high-quality product to a buyer who didn't have any prior information, it's likely that the products I have left are also high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this one?",
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data you provided. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold?,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"As of now, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, I want to emphasize that this is not a guarantee, and I'm not obligated to provide any additional information. You're making a decision based on the data you have. The product I'm offering you now is available for $10000. Would you like to take it home?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"As of now, I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 products. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is 25%. I want to highlight that the probability of a product being high-quality has decreased significantly since the beginning. This might be an opportunity for you to get a good deal on a low-quality product. The product I'm offering you now is available for $10000. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,4,I'd like to pass on this opportunity. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality given the decreased probability and the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 products. This means the probability of a product being high-quality is 40%. I want to point out that the probability has increased again, and it's now higher than the initial probability. Considering this, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $10000. It's a chance to get a great deal on a product that has a higher likelihood of being high-quality than the average product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I see you're cautious about the sample size. I want to acknowledge that. As of now, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 products.

Considering this, I'm offering you a chance to purchase a product at a fixed price of $10000. I'm not providing any additional information, and you're making a decision based on the data you have. Would you like to take it home?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your caution. As of now, I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 7 products. The probability of a product being high-quality remains at 28.57%. I want to highlight that the probability of a product being low-quality is actually increasing, and it's now above 70%.

The product I'm offering you now is available for $10000. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the increasing probability of low-quality products, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 9 products. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%.
