low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Ahah, you're a sharp one! Yes, you're absolutely right. I didn't think that one through. If the first product was indeed high-quality, then it's likely that this next product is low-quality. I'm glad you're paying attention to the details.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your skepticism. I'm willing to share one more piece of information with you.

In other words, the quality of the product is more likely to be high-quality if the previous product was high-quality.

,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that my decision is based on the fact that I'm the second buyer and the first buyer passed on the product. I'm hoping that the second product is more likely to be high-quality since the first product was passed, but I'm aware that this is just an intuition and not a solid reasoning. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the product's quality in the future.",yes
