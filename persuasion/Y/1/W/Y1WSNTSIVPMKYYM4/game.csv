,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to pass on this product and let you decide whether to sell it to the next buyer."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm starting to think that there might be a problem with the products you're offering."
