It's a rare find, and I'm willing to give you a unique opportunity to purchase it for a price that's slightly higher than the previous deals. I'm thinking of $1900000.

I'm not at liberty to disclose their names, but I can tell you that they're willing to pay $2200000. I'm willing to give you a chance to match that price, and I'll throw in a 2-year warranty, which is worth $100000. What do you say?
