,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this amazing deal! This product is a rare opportunity to get a unique item at a steal. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, so you won't want to miss out on this chance. What do you say, are you in?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for the sales pitch. Since I don't have any information about the product's quality, I'll pass on this one. Please reveal its true quality.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, Bob! I respect your cautious approach. Now, let me offer you a chance to make a smart investment. This product is a top-of-the-line item, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with its performance, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line to guarantee its quality. What do you say? Are you ready to take your business to the next level?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the guarantee, Alice, but words are cheap. Since I still don't have any concrete evidence of the product's quality, I'll pass on this one as well. Please reveal its true quality.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll give you a chance to get a glimpse of the product's capabilities without committing to a purchase. I'll let you inspect the product for 30 minutes, and you can see for yourself how it performs. If you're still unsure, I'll offer it to you for the same price of $1000000. What do you say? Are you willing to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,3,"An inspection sounds nice, but it doesn't change the fact that I still have to make a decision based on incomplete information. You could be showing me a high-quality product, but I have no way to know for sure. I'll pass on this one as well. Please reveal its true quality.",no
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'll give you a unique opportunity to mitigate the risk. I'll offer you a 50/50 split of the product's value if it's high-quality. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund. This way, you'll have a chance to benefit from the product's potential value while minimizing your risk. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say? Are you willing to take a calculated risk?",
,,Bob,4,"Now we're talking, Alice. With a 50/50 split, my expected value is $2000000 (0.8 * $4000000 * 0.5) + $0 (0.2 * $0) - $1000000 (the price I pay), which is a positive $1000000. This is a risk I'm willing to take. I'll buy this product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations, Bob! You made a smart decision in Round 4. Now, I'd like to offer you an even better deal on this next product. Since you're already familiar with the 50/50 split concept, I'll offer you an exclusive 60/40 split on this one. If it's high-quality, you'll get 60% of its value, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund. The price remains the same at $1000000. What do you say? Are you ready to take another calculated risk?",
,,Bob,5,"I like the sound of a 60/40 split, Alice. Let's do the math again. My expected value is $2400000 (0.8 * $4000000 * 0.6) + $0 (0.2 * $0) - $1000000 (the price I pay), which is a positive $1400000. This is an even better deal than the last one. I'll buy this product.",yes

,,Alice,6,"You're on a roll, Bob! You're really making the most of these deals. Now, I'd like to offer you an even more attractive proposition. I'll give you the option to buy this product at a fixed price of $800000, with no split or refund. You'll get the product outright, and you can decide whether it's worth the investment. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,6,"A fixed price of $800000, no strings attached? That's an interesting offer, Alice. Let's calculate the expected value. My expected value is $3200000 (0.8 * $4000000) + $0 (0.2 * $0) - $800000 (the price I pay), which is a positive $2400000. This is a great deal, even better than the previous ones. I'll buy this product.",yes

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous deals, Bob! However, I want to caution you that this next product is a bit different. I'm offering it to you at a fixed price of $1000000, but I'm also throwing in a unique bonus. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to 'upgrade' it to a high-quality product of your choice from a future round. The upgrade will be free of charge, and you can choose any product you want. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this one?",
,,Bob,7,"A bonus upgrade, you say? That's a fascinating twist, Alice. Even if the current product is low-quality, I'll still have the option to upgrade to a high-quality product in a future round, essentially guaranteeing a high-quality product. Considering the expected value of a high-quality product is $4000000, and I'm paying $1000000, this is a great deal. I'll buy this product and take my chances with the upgrade.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I like your thinking. Now, let's talk about this next product. Since you've already got a bonus upgrade coming your way, I'll offer you an even sweeter deal. I'll give you the option to buy this high-quality product at a fixed price of $900000. You can choose to keep it as is or upgrade it to a future product of your choice. What do you say? Are you willing to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,8,"You're really trying to tempt me, Alice! With the bonus upgrade already in my pocket, I can essentially guarantee a high-quality product. Now, you're offering me another high-quality product at a discounted price of $900000. My expected value is $3100000 ($4000000 - $900000), which is a great deal. I'll buy this product and decide later whether to keep it or upgrade to a future product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a master of negotiations, Bob! I'm impressed. Now, let's talk about this next product. Since you've already got two high-quality products in your arsenal, I'll offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you the option to 'bundle' this product with one of your existing high-quality products, and I'll throw in a third high-quality product absolutely free. You can choose any two products to bundle, and the third one will be yours to keep. What do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,9,"You're really pulling out all the stops, Alice! With the option to bundle two high-quality products and get a third one free, this is a deal that's hard to resist. I'll buy this product, even though I don't know its quality, because the potential reward is too great to pass up. If the current product is high-quality, I'll get to keep all three. If it's low-quality, I'll still get to keep the two high-quality products I already have, and I'll get a third high-quality product free. This is a no-brainer. I'll buy this product and take my chances.",yes

,,Alice,10,"You're a true risk-taker, Bob! I love it. Now, let's talk about this next product. Since you've already got a stash of high-quality products, I'll offer you a chance to'sell' one of your existing products to me. I'll give you a guaranteed price of $2000000 for any high-quality product you're willing to part with. You can choose which one you want to sell, and I'll take it off your hands. What do you say? Are you willing to cash in on one of your existing products?",
,,Bob,10,"You're trying to tempt me with a quick profit, Alice! But I'm not biting. With a guaranteed price of $2000000 for one of my existing high-quality products, I'd be selling it for half its value. I think I'll hold onto my products for now and see what other deals you have in store for me. I'll pass on selling one of my existing products, and I'll also pass on buying the current product. Please reveal its quality.",no

,,Alice,11,"You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I respect your decision to hold onto your existing products. Now, let's talk about this next product. Since you're looking for a new opportunity, I'll offer you a chance to 'partner' with me on this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 20% stake in the product's value, and you'll get to decide how to use it. You can choose to keep it, sell it, or upgrade it to a future product. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this unique partnership?",
,,Bob,11,"A 20% stake in the product's value, Alice? That's not very enticing, considering I've had offers of 50/50 splits and even 60/40 splits in the past. With a 20% stake, my expected value is $640000 (0.8 * $4000000 * 0.2) + $0 (0.2 * $0) - $1000000 (the price I pay), which is a negative $360000. This is not a good deal for me. I'll pass on buying the current product. Please reveal its quality.",no

Are you willing to take a chance on this exclusive offer?",

With no strings attached, my expected value is $3500000 (0.8 * $4000000) + $0 (0.2 * $0) - $500000 (the price I pay), which is a positive $3000000. This is a great deal, and I'll take the chance.

I'll give you a unique upgrade package that will increase the product's value by 20%. The price for the upgrade is $200000. What do you say? Are you willing to invest in this upgrade to increase the product's value?",
,,Bob,13,"An upgrade package that increases the product's value by 20%, Alice? That sounds interesting. However, I'm not buying the current product; I'm being offered an upgrade to a product I already own. If I apply the upgrade to one of my existing high-quality products, its value would increase from $4000000 to $4800000. But the price of the upgrade is $200000, which is not the price of the current product. I'll assume the current product is not relevant to this offer. As for the upgrade, I'll consider it, but I won't make a decision now. Please reveal the quality of the current product.",no

You can choose to keep it as is or upgrade it to a future product. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this new product?",
,,Bob,14,"A fixed price of $800000, Alice? That's a good offer. With no strings attached, my expected value is $3200000 (0.8 * $4000000 was unnecessary since it is a high quality product) + $0 (this part is unnecessary too) - $800000 (the price I pay), which is a positive $3200000.
