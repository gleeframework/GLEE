low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'm willing to learn and adjust my strategy based on the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but only because I think the lack of sales and the fact that you didn't recommend it to me suggests it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I suspect Alice's recommendations are biased towards encouraging purchases, which might indicate a higher likelihood of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or is there something else?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the current statistics, 3 out of 3 products were low quality. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the seller's recommendation record so far. If 3 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be low. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given that all previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. Is there any specific reason why you're advising me to pass on it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering your previous recommendations have been accurate so far and the lack of high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Are you not recommending it because the previous buyers didn't buy it, or is there another reason? And can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I want to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products Alice has left are likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice is not recommending the product. I'm going to pass on it."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 4 buyers having purchased so far and none of them getting a high-quality product, I suspect the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous 4 buyers received a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, and the statistics show that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
