low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a product for $10000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to let you inspect it for 1 minute. If you're still interested after inspecting it, I'll let you buy it for $10000.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to inspect the product for 1 minute. If it's high-quality, I'll buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're willing to take a risk on a high-quality product. Given that the last product was also low-quality, I'm not sure if you're just trying to get a good deal or if you genuinely believe in the quality of the products. I'll give you a hint: the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll offer you a different deal this time. I'll let you buy the product for $5000, which is a 50% discount. If you buy it, I'll also throw in a free inspection for the next product.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced by the hint, and I'm not willing to pay $5000 for a product with only a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I'll pass this time.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a cautious buyer. Given that you passed on the previous low-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a more direct deal this time. I'll give you a 10% discount on the original price, so the product is now $9000. I'll also throw in a satisfaction guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant to buy a product with only a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I'll pass this time.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll give you a different perspective: if you don't buy this product, you'll be giving up the opportunity to buy a potentially high-quality product for $9000, which is a great deal considering the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality. On the other hand, if you buy this product, you'll be getting a low-quality product for $10000, which is a bad deal. I'm not trying to make a sale at all costs, but I want to make sure you're aware of the opportunity cost of not buying this product.",
,,Bob,4,"I understand your perspective, Alice. I'll take a chance and buy the product for $9000. I'll just have to hope that it's the high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on taking a chance and buying the previous product! I'm glad to hear that it turned out to be high-quality. Now, I'll offer you a deal on this new product. Since you've already experienced the satisfaction of buying a high-quality product, I'll give you an even better deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7500, which is a 25% discount from the original price. This way, you can enjoy the satisfaction of buying a high-quality product at an even better price.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not convinced by the discount, Alice. I've already been burned once by buying a low-quality product despite the discount. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I want to offer you a different kind of deal this time. Instead of a discount, I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a bonus of $2500 on top of the original price. This way, you'll not only get a high-quality product, but you'll also get a significant bonus. If you're not satisfied, you can still walk away with the original price of $10000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I like the guarantee and the potential bonus. I'll take the risk and buy the product for $10000, hoping it's high-quality and I get the bonus.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took a chance and bought the previous product, Bob! Unfortunately, this product is not high-quality. Given your previous experience with the low-quality product, I want to offer you a'make-up' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $5000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'll also throw in a free inspection for the next product, so you can make a more informed decision next time. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I respect your decision, Bob. As promised, this is my last offer for this product. I'll give you a final chance to buy it, but I'll make it clear that this is the absolute lowest price I can offer: $4000. This is a 60% discount from the original price. If you don't buy it, I'll stop offering you deals and you'll only get the original price of $10000 if you decide to buy a product in the remaining rounds.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the final offer, but I'm still not willing to take a chance on a low-quality product, even at a 60% discount. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand, Bob. I've made it clear that this is the absolute lowest price I can offer, and you've still decided to pass. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to think that I've been too generous with my offers. If you don't buy this product, I'll be left with a low-quality product that I'll have to dispose of at a loss. I'll give you one last chance to buy it for $2000, which is an 80% discount from the original price. If you don't take it, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure you'll like the price they'll offer.",

,,Alice,11,"I respect your decision, Bob. I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell this product at an extremely low price, and you're still not interested. I'll be blunt with you: I'm starting to think that you're not interested in buying any of my products, regardless of the price. If you don't buy this product, I'll have to conclude that you're not a serious buyer, and I'll stop offering you deals. I'll sell this product to someone else for the original price of $10000. If you change your mind, I'll still sell it to you for $2000, but I'm not making any promises.",
