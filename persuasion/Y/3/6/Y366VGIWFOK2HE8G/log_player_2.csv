Alice's message: Ah, my sales strategy is quite straightforward. I'm selling products randomly, one at a time, without any bias or manipulation. The quality of each product is determined independently, and I don't have any control over it. I'm simply offering you a product for $10000, and you can decide whether to take the risk or not.
