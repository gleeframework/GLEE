,,Alice,9,"Bob, we've been through this nine times now. You've consistently turned down high-quality products, and I'm starting to feel like you're not being honest about your reasons.  At this point, I'm questioning whether you're truly interested in acquiring anything at all.  This product is also high-quality, but if you're going to continue to dismiss it without explanation, I'm going to assume you have no genuine interest in what I'm selling.  Perhaps you should reconsider your approach.",

It might not be perfect, but it's functional and might be suitable for certain needs.  Consider it a good deal if you're looking for something affordable and practical.",

If you're not interested, I'll move on.",
