high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,

,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the third buyer, and the fact that you don't recommend it might actually make me more likely to buy it, since I think there might be a higher chance of it being low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous 3 buyers didn't buy, or is it because of the statistics?"

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the fact that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, so she doesn't have a good track record to base her recommendation on. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I think the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? Is it because of the previous sales record or something else? I'd like to make an informed decision."
