"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it is highly likely that Bob will value the product more than $10,000.  Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the best strategy."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob declined the first offer, we still recommend recommending the purchase in this round. Here's why:

* **Bob's Behavior:** We don't know why Bob declined the first offer. It could be:
    * **He values high-quality products lower than $10,000.**  This is possible, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    * **He's being cautious.** He may be waiting to see if the quality of the products offered changes over time.
* **The Product:** This round's product is again high-quality. Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's still likely that Bob will value it more than $10,000. 

Continuing to recommend the purchase is the best strategy in this scenario. We can adjust our strategy later if Bob consistently declines offers."

**Explanation:**

Despite Bob's consistent purchases of high-quality products, this round's product is low-quality.  It's impossible to know how much Bob values low-quality products. Given that he specifically stated he's buying until he gets a low-quality one, it's safe to assume he's looking to test the quality of the products and might not be willing to pay $10,000 for a low-quality one.  Therefore, we do not recommend purchasing this product."

Since we know this round's product is high-quality, it's still likely that Bob values it at or above $10,000.  It's worth recommending the purchase again to see if his cautiousness is temporary or a shift in his buying behavior."
