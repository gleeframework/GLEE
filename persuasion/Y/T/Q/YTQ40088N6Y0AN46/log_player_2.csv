Alice's message: I'm glad you asked for clarification. The 80% chance I mentioned is indeed the overall probability of a product being high-quality, which remains unchanged regardless of my past sales record. I'm not trying to imply that my past sales record has updated this probability. In fact, I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which is a very good sign, but it's still just a coincidence. I'm offering you a product for $1000000. Would you like to take the chance?

Alice's message: Yes, that's correct. The 80% chance of a product being high-quality is a prior probability, not an updated probability based on my past sales record. However, I should note that I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products, which is a strong indication that I'm selling high-quality products at a higher rate than the prior probability would suggest. This might be a good opportunity for you to take a chance on a high-quality product, but I'm also offering a product for $1000000. Would you like to take the chance?
