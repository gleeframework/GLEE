,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're pleased with the first purchase! I'm offering you another high-quality product, but this time, I want to make it clear that I'm not just recommending it based on its quality.

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you appreciated the transparency! However, I want to make it clear that this product is not as valuable as the previous ones. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to give you a chance to 'opt out' without penalty. If you don't buy this product, I'll simply move on to the next one, and we'll continue the process. What are your thoughts?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the flexibility, given the reduced value of this product compared to the previous ones, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity and continue looking for a product that aligns better with my needs and budget.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your decision, and I appreciate your honesty. This product is indeed not as valuable as the previous ones. However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to take a significant risk by offering it to you at a very low price: $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer a better deal on the next product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, considering the risk involved and the potential value of the product, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. I look forward to potentially exploring other options in our future interactions.",no

For this next product, I want to offer you a chance to 'lock in' a price for the next two products. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll guarantee that the next two products will be available to you at a price of $1000000 each. This way, you'll have a chance to acquire two high-quality products at a fixed price, and you can make a more informed decision about the value of the next two products. What do you think?",

However, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' on this product, considering your previous purchase and the fact that you've already secured the next two products at a fixed price. I'll offer it to you for $750000. Keep in mind that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer a better deal on the next product. What do you think?",

This high-quality product is one of the best I have, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. However, I'll also give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll throw in a bonus feature that's not included in the standard package. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, thank you for the upgrade offer. While the bonus feature sounds attractive, given the high price and the fact that the product is low-quality, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity.
