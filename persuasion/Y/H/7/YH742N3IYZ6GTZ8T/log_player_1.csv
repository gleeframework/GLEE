Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  Since the price is fixed, and there's no way to know how much Bob values a high-quality product, it's in Bob's best interest to buy. There's an 80% chance he's getting a product worth more than $1,000,000 to him."
