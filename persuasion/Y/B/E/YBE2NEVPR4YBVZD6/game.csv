,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to understand the basis of your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality based on the data we have so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale, and I'd appreciate your recommendation not to buy it, so I'll pass for now."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1, I'm not confident in the quality of the product being offered to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it for now."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to wait for more data to be collected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and the low success rate of her recommendations so far suggests that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold (1/3), I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take the product anyway. I'll take the risk of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide more information about the previous sales, such as the total number of buyers and the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm curious to see if the product is high quality or low quality, and to test Alice's recommendation strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is lower than expected?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 6, I can make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high-quality, not Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you share the updated probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 2/8 = 0.25. Given that Alice didn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the third high-quality product sold."
