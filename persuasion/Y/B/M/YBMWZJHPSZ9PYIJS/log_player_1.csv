"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not making a decision based solely on the probability of it being high-quality.

However, I want to be transparent with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the fact that the previous two products were high-quality might be a coincidence.

But I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy this product at the same price, and a 50/50 chance to buy the next product at a lower price.

This might suggest that the previous high sales rate was indeed a coincidence. I'm willing to sell this new product to you for $1,000,000.
