Would you like to buy the current product?","## Step 1: Understand the game setup and rules.
The game involves buying products from Alice, with each product having a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality. A high-quality product is worth $12,000, and a low-quality product is worth $0. Alice knows the quality of each product and provides recommendations.

## Step 2: Consider Alice's recommendation.
Alice does not recommend buying the current product. Given that Alice knows the quality of the product, her recommendation suggests that the product is likely of low quality.

## Step 3: Review the statistics provided.
No products have been sold yet, which means there is no historical data to influence the decision. The decision should be based solely on Alice's recommendation and the known probabilities of product quality.

## Step 4: Make a decision based on the information available.
Given the 50% chance of the product being high quality and Alice's recommendation against buying, it is reasonable to trust Alice's insight since she knows the product's quality. The potential loss of $10,000 if the product is low quality outweighs the potential gain of $2,000 if it is high quality, especially considering Alice's negative recommendation.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation and the potential risk seems too high without any positive indication of quality.""}"
