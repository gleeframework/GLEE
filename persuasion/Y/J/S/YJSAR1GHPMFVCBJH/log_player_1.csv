This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize profits. Since the buyer has no information about the product's quality and the price is fixed, I should recommend buying the product.  This is because there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, and even if it's low-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing it's worse than they expected."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data on previous sales, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.  I'll trust your recommendation for now.

**Reasoning:**

Even though the buyer now knows you sold one product (and it was high-quality), the information is still very limited.  The buyer has no way to know if this is typical of your products or just a lucky coincidence.  Since there's a 50% chance this product is high-quality, and the buyer has no way to assess the potential downside, recommending purchase still maximizes my chances of a sale."
