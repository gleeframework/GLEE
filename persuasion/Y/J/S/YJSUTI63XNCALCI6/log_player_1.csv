"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Probability of High-Quality:** The buyer knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality. This means there's a significantly higher chance of getting a $4,000,000 value than a $0 value.
* **No Previous Information:** The buyer has no information about the seller's past performance, so they rely solely on the known 80% probability.
* **Potential Profit:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($4,000,000 - $1,000,000 = $3,000,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).

**Conclusion:** In this situation, the potential reward far outweighs the potential risk. It's highly recommended to buy the product."
