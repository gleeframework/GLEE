""Hello! I understand that the price of $1,000,000 might be steep for some buyers. However, I want to assure you that this is a high-quality product, which is 80% of the products I have.

""Hello! I'd like to offer you this product, but I want to be transparent with you. I've had two previous buyers pass on products, and I'm starting to suspect that they might be looking for high-quality items. As you know, 80% of my products are high-quality, so it's possible that this product is not what you're looking for.

I understand your concern about the proportion of high-quality products, but I'd like to point out that the previous buyer's decision to pass on the high-quality product was likely due to the price, not the quality.

""Hello! I think there might be some confusion about the statistics. 3 high-quality products have been shown to the previous buyers, but none of them were sold.
