}"

}"
"The buyer's message: I've seen that the two products sold so far were low-quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. Given that the price remains $100 and the expected value of a product is (0.3333 * $300) = $100, I don't have enough information to believe that this product is more likely to be high-quality than the base rate. I'll pass on this one.

}"
"The buyer's message: Although the updated probability of 40% for a high-quality product is higher than the initial 33.33%, and the potential value of $300 for a high-quality product is enticing, the overall risk remains too high given the cost of $100.

}"
"The buyer's message: Based on the statistics provided, it seems that the probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed low, as you've mentioned. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases and a total of 3 low-quality products out of 6 sold, I'm inclined to believe that the risk outweighs the potential reward at this price point.
