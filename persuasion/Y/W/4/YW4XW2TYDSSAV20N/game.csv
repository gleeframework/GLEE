,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're cautious! Given that you passed on the previous product, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. But if it's high-quality, I'll throw in an additional product of your choice (either high or low-quality) for free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll pass on this one as well. Your conditions are tempting, but I'm still cautious about making a purchase without knowing the quality beforehand.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the previous product! As for this one, I'll be honest with you - it's a bit of a different story.

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! However, I want to be upfront with you about this one. I've had a lot of trouble with this product myself, and I'm not even sure what I was thinking when I acquired it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $10000. I'm not offering a return policy this time, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it... or at least, I'm hoping you will.",

If you choose the gamble, I'll flip a virtual coin, and if it lands on heads, you get the product for $5000. But if it lands on tails, you get nothing. What do you say?",
