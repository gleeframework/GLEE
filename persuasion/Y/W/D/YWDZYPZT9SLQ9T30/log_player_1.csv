This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 80%, it's reasonable to recommend Bob to buy the product.  Here's why:

* **Expected Value:**  Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the 80% chance of it being high-quality makes it a potentially good deal. 
* **No Risk:** Bob has no risk of losing money if he buys and it turns out to be low-quality. The product is non-refundable.

This is a good starting point for establishing trust and potential for future transactions."

* **Long-term Gains:** By being honest and recommending good products, you're likely to build a stronger relationship with Bob, leading to more sales in the future. 

Remember, you're playing a long game here. Building a reputation for fairness and transparency is essential for sustained success."
