high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product? What was the outcome?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but the lack of sales data is not very informative. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it and there's a possibility it's low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of the product being high quality is 20.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers also passed on the products, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both of them chose to pass, I'm starting to suspect that the products recommended to them might have been low-quality. I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it might mean it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 2 out of 2 products were recommended and both were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a final decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. This might indicate that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the statistics?"
