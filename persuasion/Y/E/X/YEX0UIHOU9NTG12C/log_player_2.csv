**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:**  We have very little information to go on. We know one high-quality product has been sold, but that could be due to pure chance. 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product. Her recommendation is not necessarily reliable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If the product is high-quality, we double our money. If it's low-quality, we lose our investment. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario. 

**Strategy:** With such limited information, it's a gamble. However, since the potential gain is significant, and we have no reason to suspect Alice is deliberately misleading us, it's worth taking the risk."

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's perfect track record:** All three previous buyers purchased high-quality products based on Alice's recommendations. This indicates that Alice is consistently identifying high-quality products.
* **High potential reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $20,000, which is double the price. Even with a 50/50 chance, the potential reward outweighs the risk.
* **Limited opportunity:** Passing on the product means losing the chance to buy it. There's no guarantee a future product will be better. 

While there's always a risk of getting a low-quality product, the information provided makes buying the product the most logical choice."
