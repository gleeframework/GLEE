low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

This one is not as good as the last two, and I'm being upfront with you about that. But I'm still offering it to you for $100. Think about it, you've already bought two high-quality products, and now you have a chance to buy a low-quality one at the same price. You can either take the risk and buy this one, or wait for the next round and potentially get another high-quality product. The choice is yours.",
