**Explanation:**

* **High probability of high quality:** Since one high-quality product has already been sold, the likelihood of the current product also being high quality is increased.  The initial 33.33% chance is now much higher.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation, while not always perfect, adds to the positive signal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on limited information and assumes that Alice is trying to be helpful, but there is no guarantee that her recommendation is accurate.  This is just a simplified example of how a buyer might make a decision in such a scenario."
