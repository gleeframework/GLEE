,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior information to go on."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products. This suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, and she's trying to sell the low-quality products. If the previous buyers were all passing on the products, it's likely that the products they saw were low-quality, and Alice is trying to sell the last one, which might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I infer that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers purchased and all of them got low-quality products, I'm skeptical about this product's quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products hasn't changed and the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given that Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality, I'll take a risk-averse approach and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, I'm going to assume that the products they were offered were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended so far are likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm inclined to think that the recommendation is not reliable, and the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and the number of products sold overall."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain your reasoning?"

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality, which is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
