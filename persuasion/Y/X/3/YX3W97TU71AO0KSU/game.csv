low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that you didn't recommend it and only 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if you, the first buyer, got a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to take the risk. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I think the probability of getting a high-quality product is low, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process and the proportion of high-quality products sold before them.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on. I'm making a blind guess. If you're not recommending it, I'm assuming it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous products were high quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high or low quality, and the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low quality, I think it's likely that this product is also low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which might indicate it's low quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, I see that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'm inclined to be cautious and pass on this product."
