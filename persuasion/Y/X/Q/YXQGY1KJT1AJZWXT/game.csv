,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I want to take advantage of the fact that the product is still unknown and the probability of it being high-quality is 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and still chose not to purchase, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation.
