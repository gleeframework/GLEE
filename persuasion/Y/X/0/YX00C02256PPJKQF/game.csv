,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not just trying to discourage me. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product, and now I'm the second buyer. I'd like to know if the previous buyer's decision was influenced by your recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of getting a high-quality product is still quite low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I'd like to take a chance on the high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of the sold products were high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low-quality is higher than 66.67%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"I understand that previous buyers have been hesitant, but I assure you that I'm not trying to deceive anyone. I'm confident that this product is worth considering. If you buy it, you'll see that my recommendation is genuine."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and it's not worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $10000. If I buy it, I'll make a decision based on the quality of the product, and I'll let you know whether it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have not purchased high-quality products, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being sold. Given the low probability of a high-quality product and Alice's recommendation, I will pass on this product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand that previous buyers have been disappointed, but I want to assure you that this product is an exception. I've never been more confident in a product's quality. If you buy it, I'm sure you'll be satisfied."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. With 4 sales and 0 high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'd like to see the proportion before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendation and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it and 0 high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for another opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm surprised that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy, which suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given that you don't recommend it, and the previous sales record of 0 high-quality products sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers did not buy the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are based on the product's quality. Since Alice is not recommending me to buy the product, I suspect it's likely to be low-quality. I will pass on it to avoid a potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not buying. Your previous recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 4 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
