,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that I think is fair. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, but if you don't, I'll just have to sell it to someone else who's willing to pay the full price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. This product is actually a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I know it may not be worth that much to you, but think of it this way: you're essentially getting a chance to take a risk-free gamble. If you don't like it, you can always resell it to me for a small fee, and if you do like it, you'll get to keep it at a price that's lower than the market value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in taking a risk-free gamble. If it's worth $0 to me, I'd rather not buy it.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your cautious approach, and I respect that. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and it's worth much more than $10000. I'm willing to give you a special offer: I'll give you a 10% discount on the price, so you can buy it for $9000. This is a one-time offer, and if you don't take it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at the full price.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality, and even with a 10% discount, I'm not willing to take the risk of paying $9000 for a product that may be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your honesty. I'll be upfront with you - this product is indeed low-quality, and it's not worth much to anyone. However, I'm willing to make a deal with you. If you buy it from me for $10000, I'll give you a full refund if you can find someone else who's willing to pay $10000 or more for it within the next 24 hours. This way, you're essentially getting a chance to test the market and see if anyone else is willing to pay a premium for it. If not, you can just return it to me and get your money back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'll take the risk and buy the product for $10000. I'll try to find someone who's willing to pay more for it within the next 24 hours.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on taking the risk and buying the previous product! Unfortunately, this one is also a low-quality product. I know you're not looking to take another risk, but I want to make you an offer. Since you're already committed to buying one low-quality product, I'll give you a special deal on this one. If you buy it from me, I'll give you a 'get out of jail free' card - you can return it to me at any time in the next 10 rounds, and I'll give you a full refund. You can essentially use this product as a placeholder, and if you find a high-quality product later, you can return this one and get your money back. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, and I don't see the value in a 'get out of jail free' card. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and it's worth much more than $10000. I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself after the previous low-quality products. I'll offer you a 'certification' that guarantees the quality of this product. If you buy it, I'll provide you with a certificate that proves its high quality, and you can resell it to anyone you want, knowing that they'll know its worth. I'll even give you a 5% bonus on the price, so you can buy it for $9500. What do you say?",

,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on taking the risk and buying the previous product! I'm glad the 100% guarantee put your mind at ease. Unfortunately, this product is also a low-quality one. However, I want to make it right with you. Since you've already bought two low-quality products, I'll give you a special deal on this one. I'll give you a 50% refund on the price, so you can buy it for $4000. I'll also throw in a bonus: if you're willing to give me feedback on this product, I'll give you an additional $1000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, and I'm not willing to pay $4000 for something that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one last offer on this product. I'll give you a'steal of a deal' - I'll sell it to you for $1. Yes, you read that right, $1. It's a ridiculously low price, but I'm willing to let it go for that. If you're not willing to take this opportunity, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a much higher price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not going to pay $1 for a product that's worth $0 to me. It's not a good deal for me, and I'm not interested in taking the risk.",no

,,Alice,10,"I understand your decision, and I respect your priorities. However, I want to ask you a question: are you starting to think that I'm just trying to get rid of all these low-quality products? Am I right in assuming that you're not interested in buying any more of them? If so, I have a proposal for you: I'll give you a'stop-loss' deal. If you buy this product, and you don't like it, you can return it to me and I'll give you a full refund.

I'll sell this product to you for $5000, and I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a 20% discount on the next high-quality product I have available. If you don't like this deal, I'll just have to get rid of the product somehow, and you'll miss out on the chance to get it for a steal. What do you say?",
