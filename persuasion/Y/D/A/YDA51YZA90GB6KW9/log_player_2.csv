Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your careful consideration. However, I'd like to point out that you're not actually paying $1000000 for an 80% chance of a high-quality product. You're paying $1000000 for a product that has already been shown to have a 66.67% chance of being high-quality (2 out of 3 high-quality products sold). The probability of this product being high-quality is actually higher than 80%! I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 10% discount if you buy this product, making it $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to maintain this price.

Alice's message: Congratulations on making a great deal! I'm glad you were able to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Now, let's talk about this new product. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 75%! However, I want to be upfront with you - the previous product you bought was actually low-quality, which means that the true probability of a product being high-quality might be lower than 80%. I'm willing to offer you a deal: I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, making it $800000. But if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. It's a risk-free purchase, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with this product.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your willingness to think critically about the situation. I'll be honest with you - I do have a product that I'm willing to sell, and I'm not looking to discard it. If you're not interested, I'll sell it to the next person who comes along. However, I want to make you an offer that's hard to refuse. I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, just like I offered on the last one, making it $800000. But I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% bonus on the purchase price. That's a total of $880000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with this product.
