Alice's message: Welcome to the second product! I've just sold one product, and it was low-quality. This means that 1 out of 2 products I've sold so far is low-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I've already sold one low-quality product, so the probability of this one being high-quality is 50% as well.

Alice's message: Welcome to the fourth product! I'll provide you with the information you requested. The first product that was sold was low-quality, and the second product that you passed on is also low-quality. This means that out of the 3 products I've had in stock so far, 2 are low-quality. I still have 1 product remaining. The probability of this one being high-quality is 50%, but it's worth noting that the probability of me having a high-quality product left is actually higher than 50% since I've already sold two low-quality products. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000.

I'll offer you a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, but I'll also provide you with a 50/50 chance of getting a low-quality product. The price remains the same at $1000000.
