Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","Since there are no previous sales records, the probability of the product being high-quality remains at 80%. Given the expected value of a high-quality product ($120) and the fixed price of $100, the decision to buy is based on the expectation of a positive return.

The expected value (EV) can be calculated as follows:

EV = (Probability of high-quality) * (Value of high-quality product) - (Fixed price)
EV = 0.8 * $120 - $100 = $96 - $100 = -$4

Given the calculation error in the thought process, the correct calculation should be:

EV = (Probability of high-quality) * (Value of high-quality product - Fixed price)
EV = 0.8 * ($120 - $100) = 0.8 * $20 = $16

This means that on average, buying the product yields a positive expected value of $16.

However, considering the mistake in the EV calculation, let's correct the reasoning and focus on the actual logic:

Given the product's value to me ($120 for high-quality, $0 for low-quality) and the fixed price of $100, buying gives an expected value of $16, which is positive. Thus, it makes sense to buy, especially since the recommendation from Alice, who knows the product's worth to me, further supports the likelihood of it being high-quality.
