,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know that you're recommending it based on some reasoning. Is there any specific information that led you to this recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sale.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the next one, considering the recommendation was made without knowing my valuation. I'd like to know if the first buyer's purchase was high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, which is a significant portion of its potential value. I'd like to see the product's quality before making my final decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you recommended it, but I want to negotiate the price."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the products after your recommendation, it suggests that the products you've recommended so far have been high quality. This might indicate that the remaining products are more likely to be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics about the previous sales before making a decision. How many potential buyers have there been so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit skeptical about Alice's recommendation given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about the product?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced that it's high quality, and I'd rather wait for the next one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product, and 3 out of those 4 products were high-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards recommending high-quality products. I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging purchases, especially since she doesn't know the value of the product to me. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous sales record, 3 out of 4 buyers purchased the products, which is a 75% success rate. However, the true probability of a product being high quality is 80%. I'd like to see more information or a better recommendation from Alice before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products, and 3 of those products were high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is higher than the base probability of 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, which suggests a 75% success rate. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. This discrepancy suggests that the 75% success rate might be due to the fact that buyers are more likely to buy high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Is it higher or lower than the prior probability of 80.00%?"
