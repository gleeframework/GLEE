,,Alice,12,yes,The probability of this product being high-quality is 50% based on the previous sales record.
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation.
