low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer and I have no information about the product's quality, so my decision is based on the expected value of buying a product. With a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $12000 and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0, my expected value is ($12000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4000. Since I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, I'm better off buying it."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced it's a good value given the lack of sales and no high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see if you can give me a recommendation based on the next buyer's decision
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 1 out of 1 product recommended by you was low quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see the recommendation for the next buyer.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, which might have been a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information. I'll wait for the next buyer to make a decision and see if they buy the product. If they do, I'll have more information about the proportion of high-quality products remaining."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the statistics. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. If it were high quality, it's likely that she would have recommended it to the previous buyer, and they would have bought it. Since it was sold to the previous buyer, it's more likely that this product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there's a 33.33% chance it's high quality, and I'm willing to take that risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, I'm suspicious that the products they got were low-quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is low. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the statistics show 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. However, I still believe that the expected value of buying the product is higher than passing on it, given the low price of $10000. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is relatively low, making it a riskier purchase."
