high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, but I'm confident that this one is a gem. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a steal considering the quality is likely to be exceptional. Take a chance and you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, Alice. With a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality and no previous sales record to back up your claim, I don't think it's worth the $10000 risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 2 in total. I'm offering this product to you for $10000. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to prove my commitment to transparency and fairness. You're taking a risk, but I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",

I'm transparent about my sales record, and I'm willing to sell this product at a loss to prove that I'm not trying to deceive you. Take a chance and see for yourself.",
,,the buyer,4,"Although I appreciate your transparency, I'll pass on this product due to the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you're trying to sell it for $10000, which is still a significant price considering the risk involved.",no

,,Alice,7,"I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 3 low-quality products in total. I want to be transparent with you: I'm starting to see a pattern here. It's possible that I might have a higher proportion of low-quality products. I'm offering this product to you for $10000, but I'll give you a 50% discount if you're willing to take the risk. I'll sell it to you for $5000.",

I want to be transparent with you: I've had a long streak of low-quality products, and I'm not sure if I've got a high-quality product for you. I'm willing to give you a 95% discount on this one. I'll sell it to you for $500. It's a low-risk purchase, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me.",
,,the buyer,10,"Although you're offering a significant discount, your track record of selling low-quality products and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold based on your recommendations makes me hesitant to take the risk, even at $500.",no

I'm taking a risk by offering this warranty, but I'm confident in the quality of this product.",
,,the buyer,11,"Although you're offering a warranty, your past sales record doesn't seem to align with your claims of confidence in the product's quality. You mentioned 0 high-quality products have been sold to the previous 2 buyers in this round, and your overall record shows 2 high-quality products out of 8 total sales.

It's a very low-risk purchase, and I'm hoping you'll take a chance on me.",
,,the buyer,12,"Although the discounted price of $100 is appealing, I must consider the product's quality and your sales record. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold to the 2 previous buyers, and your overall sales record of 2 high-quality products and 8 low-quality products does not inspire confidence, I will pass on this offer. The 99% discount suggests you are trying to get rid of a potentially low-quality product, which further reinforces my decision.",no

This inconsistency raises concerns about your credibility.
