Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
Alice should still recommend Bob *not* to buy the product. Here's why:

* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob is clearly using a strategy of not buying unless Alice recommends it. This means Alice can't use this round to change his mind.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though this product is high-quality,  the risk of Bob continuing to not buy in future rounds if Alice starts recommending is too high. It's better to continue the pattern of not recommending and hope Bob eventually changes his strategy."

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Alice should still recommend Bob *not* to buy. The logic remains the same:

* **Bob's Strategy:**  He's heavily reliant on Alice's recommendations. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even though a high-quality product might come up soon, risking Bob's trust for a single sale is not worth it.  Alice needs to build credibility first.
