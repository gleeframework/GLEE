Alice's message: I completely understand your concerns, Bob. I want to assure you that this product is a great opportunity to get a deal. Think about all the money you'll save by not having to spend $1000000 on a product that's only worth $0 to you. It's a no-risk, no-brainer! I'm still offering it to you for $1000000, a price that's already 100% off its true value. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if I can get a better deal.""}"

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your cautious approach, Bob. But let me ask you, what's the worst that could happen if you buy this product? It's still a $1000000 product, and you're only out $1000000 if it's low-quality. But what if it's high-quality? You'll be getting a product worth $2000000 for half the price! The potential upside is huge. And think about the prestige and bragging rights you'll get from owning a product that's worth so much more than what you paid for it. Don't let fear hold you back from making a smart business decision. Take a chance and buy this product for $1000000.
