,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, I'll buy the product"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This seems too low to justify the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality, and I don't want to waste $100 on it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm hesitant to buy, especially with Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that you don't recommend it and the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Can you explain why you don't think this product is worth buying?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all the previous products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is higher than the observed proportion of high-quality products sold. I'd rather wait for the next product, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $100. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'd like to take the risk and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. Can you explain your reasoning for not recommending this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product."
