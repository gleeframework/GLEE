**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation is a strong signal:**  Since Alice knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation is valuable information. 
* **High success rate:**  A 100% success rate in selling high-quality products is a compelling indicator. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's still a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($120) is significant. 

**Note:** This decision is based on the given information. A more complex strategy might involve considering the expected value of the product (taking into account the probability of getting a high-quality product). However, with the current data, buying the product is the most reasonable option."
