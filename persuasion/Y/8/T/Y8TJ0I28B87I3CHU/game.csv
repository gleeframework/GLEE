,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 so far, so the probability of this product being high-quality is 75%. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is an unusually high streak.

However, I'm confident that this product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $10000.

This suggests that my previous success rate might have been due to chance, and I should not be trusted.
