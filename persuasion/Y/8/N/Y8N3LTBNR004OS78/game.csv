high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, I'm offering it to you for $100, a one-time offer!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I'm the first one and I don't have any prior information to go by.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and I'm not sure what the quality of the next one is. But I can tell you that I have 19 more products to go. You can be the one to break the streak of unknown quality, or take a chance on the next one... for $100, of course!",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the current product. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, but I'm hoping to break the streak of unknown quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products now, and only 1 of them was high-quality. That means the probability of the next one being high-quality is 50%, just like the first one. But, I'll give you a hint: I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. You might want to think about the odds...",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products now, with only 1 high-quality one. That means the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 50%. But, I'll give you a hint: the last 2 products I sold were low-quality, and the first one was high-quality. This one might be a good opportunity to balance out the odds... for $100, of course!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor, and I'm not willing to take the risk for $100. I'd like to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, but they were all in the first 3 rounds. The last 2 products I sold were low-quality. You might be wondering if I've 'gotten lucky' and sold all the good ones early. I'll let you in on a secret: I've still got 16 more products to go. The odds are still 50/50, but maybe you'd rather wait and see if I can sell a few more low-quality ones...",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your attempt to reassure me. I'll just have to take my chances.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products now, and 2 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a hint: I've now sold half of my total stock. If I'm selling high-quality products at a higher rate than low-quality ones, you might be getting a good deal... for $100, of course!",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take the chance and buy the product. I'm aware of the 50/50 odds, but I'm also aware that you've sold more high-quality products than low-quality ones so far. I'm hoping to get lucky!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 3 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a statistic: 62.5% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality. You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've got 13 more products to go. Do you want to take a chance on the next one?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the odds are still 50/50 and there are 13 more products left. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 3 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a statistic: 66.7% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality. You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've still got 14 more products to go. And, I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row. You might want to think about the probability of a low-quality product coming next...",
,,the buyer,8,"I'll take the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which makes me think the next product might be low-quality, but I'm still taking the chance because of the overall 66.7% success rate.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 4 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a statistic: 63.6% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality. You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've just sold a low-quality product after 2 high-quality ones. Maybe I'm just 'due' for a low-quality one. Do you want to take a chance on the next one?",

You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've got 12 more products to go. And, I've just sold a high-quality product after a low-quality one.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 5 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a statistic: 61.5% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality. You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. Maybe I'm just getting back to normal. Or maybe I've got a streak of bad luck. You decide!",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to buy the product. However, I'm aware that there's a possibility that the product might be low-quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that the overall proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 61.5%, which is higher than the expected 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 6 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a statistic: 57.1% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality. You might think that's a sign that I've sold too many high-quality products already, and the next one is more likely to be low-quality. Or maybe I've just been unlucky so far. You decide!",
,,the buyer,12,I'm not convinced by the statistics. I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality products before making a decision.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,

You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've got 11 more products to go. And, I've just sold a high-quality product after a low-quality one. Maybe I'm getting back on track... or maybe I'm just alternating between good and bad luck. You decide!",
,,the buyer,13,I'm not convinced by the alternating pattern of high and low quality products. I'd like to wait for a few more sales to see if the pattern holds or if it's just a coincidence.,no
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,

You might think that's a good sign, but remember, I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row. You might want to consider the probability of a low-quality product coming next... or maybe I've finally figured out how to sell only high-quality products!",
,,the buyer,15,"I'll take the product, but I'm not convinced by your argument. I think the streak of high-quality products is a red herring, and the probability of a low-quality product remains 50%.",yes

You might think that's a good sign, but I'll be honest with you: I've been selling products for 16 rounds, and I've still got 4 more to go. Maybe it's time for the odds to catch up with me...",

,,Alice,19,"I've sold 14 high-quality products and 7 low-quality ones. The odds are still 50/50, but I'll give you a statistic: 70% of the products I've sold so far have been high-quality.
