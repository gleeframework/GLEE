low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Was it based on the previous buyer's decision?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000, as the probability of it being high quality seems low based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to believe it's a low-quality product. Given the low probability of a high-quality product (33.33%), and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales of high-quality products so far, but I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, I infer that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be reliable. I'd rather wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable, given that all previous buyers have also purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm skeptical about the current product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product based on your previous recommendations. Since none of the previous buyers purchased the product, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that all previous buyers have passed on the products, making it more likely that the product is low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate of previous buyers and your recommendation against it. I'll take a chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance, since you don't recommend it, it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 out of 8 products were low quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is higher than 33.33%. I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't change my decision, but I'd like to clarify the terms of the sale."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the fact that 9 buyers have been sold the product and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
