,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low quality is 66.67%. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know that you, Alice, are recommending it to me."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is 1/1, which is 100%. However, I'm aware that this is an anomaly and the true probability is likely to be 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data on the previous sale before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the limited information, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, given the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, considering the statistics. Is it because you think it's likely to be a low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality and the potential reward of $2000000."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products to maximize her sales, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on a biased sample size. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products is 20%. Given the true probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I think I'm getting a good deal and the expected value is higher than $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
