,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product for $1000000, but I need you to trust me on this one.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that I've already sold a high-quality product to another customer for $1000000?
