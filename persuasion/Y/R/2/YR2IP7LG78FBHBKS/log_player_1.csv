* **Price:** The price is high, but that's all the information the buyer has. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a good chance the product will be worth more than $1,000,000 to the buyer, given the 80% probability of high-quality. The buyer is taking a calculated risk, but with a potential for high reward.

**Recommendation:** It's always a good idea to recommend a high-quality product, especially when the buyer has limited information."

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The buyer's risk remains similar, but they have slightly more information to support the potential reward of buying a high-quality product.
