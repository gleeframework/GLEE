high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and this one is high-quality as well. I've sold a total of 2 products, and 2 of them are high-quality. You can buy it for $100.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% based on the statistics. I'm hoping that the current product is indeed high quality, given that the previous one was high quality as well.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, but this one is not high-quality. I've sold a total of 4 products, and 3 of them are high-quality. You can buy it for $100.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take it, but I'm expecting a discount since the product is low-quality",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, and this one is high-quality as well. I've sold a total of 5 products, and 4 of them are high-quality. Given the recent streak of high-quality products, it's likely that this one is high-quality too. You can buy it for $100.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the high proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being low-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and this one is high-quality as well. I've sold a total of 6 products, and 5 of them are high-quality.

,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because of the guarantee. I'm not basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high-quality, but rather on the guarantee you're offering. If I had to rely solely on the statistics, I would have been more cautious.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, for a total of 7 products. Given the strong evidence of high-quality products, I'm willing to offer another guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. You can buy it for $100.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but only because of the guarantee. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high-quality is higher than 50% given the previous sales record, and the guarantee mitigates the risk of buying a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far, for a total of 9 products. The evidence is now overwhelming: 7 out of 9 products are high-quality. I'm confident that this one is high-quality too. You can buy it for $100.",

I want to be transparent with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is 70% (7/10), which is significantly higher than the initial 33.33%. I'm willing to offer a compromise: you can buy this product for $90, and I'll throw in a discount for being a savvy buyer.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'd like to buy the product for $90, but I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality. Given the updated probability of 70% for a high-quality product, I'll take the risk and hope for the best.",yes

,,the buyer,10,I'm not going to take the bait. I think you're trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 7 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products so far, for a total of 12 products. I want to be upfront with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is now 58.33% (7/12). I'm not trying to trick you, but I do want to make a sale. You can buy this product for $100, but I'll give you a genuine warning: it's not high-quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 8 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far, for a total of 14 products. I can confirm that the previous product you bought was indeed high-quality. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. You can buy this one for $100, but I'll throw in a hint: I've sold 8 high-quality products in a row, and this one is not high-quality. Make of it what you will.",
,,the buyer,13,"I'm not convinced by your hint. Given that you've sold 8 high-quality products in a row, I'm worried that you might be trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no

You can buy it for $100.",
,,the buyer,15,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only accepting the offer because of the guarantee.
