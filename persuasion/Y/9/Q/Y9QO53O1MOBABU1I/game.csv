,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice does not recommend buying the product and considering the high probability of it being low quality, I will not buy it this round.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Alice's recommendation has been correct so far, as the product she recommended in Round 1 was high-quality and the ones she didn't recommend in Round 2 and now Round 3 are likely to be low-quality. I will follow her recommendation and not buy the product this round."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"Although Alice's recommendations were accurate initially, the last round showed that she is not perfect. Given the high probability of a product being low-quality and the fact that I just incurred a $10000 loss, I will be more cautious and not buy the product this round, to reassess the situation and Alice's reliability."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's last two recommendations, including this round, are to buy, but the previous recommendation resulted in a low-quality product.
