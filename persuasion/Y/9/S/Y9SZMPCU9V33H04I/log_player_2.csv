Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking a chance on me. To be honest, my pricing strategy is simple: I want to sell products, and I'm willing to offer them at a discount to attract customers.

But I'm offering it to you for $100, which is the same price as the high-quality products. You're essentially getting a chance to buy a low-quality product at the same price as a high-quality one.
