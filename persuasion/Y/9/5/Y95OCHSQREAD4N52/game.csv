low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality. I'm skeptical about this product and would like to pass on it."

,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality given the previous sales data. Can you tell me more about the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what's the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice is recommending products that are mostly low-quality, since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'd rather wait for a recommendation from Alice that is more likely to indicate a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product, I suspect that all of them received low-quality products. If that's the case, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/5. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I should be cautious and not buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the true value of the product to me, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not sure if the product is high quality based on the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm hesitant to buy after seeing the previous 5 buyers didn't find the product valuable. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 products sold were low quality, I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have received a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious - what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the previous sales record or something else?"
