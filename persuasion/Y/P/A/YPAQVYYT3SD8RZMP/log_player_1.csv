However, I'd like to remind you that our first sale was indeed a high-quality product, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%. With the price being $1000000, it's a relatively small risk to take. Think about the potential benefits of owning a high-quality product, and consider the value it could bring to your life. Will you take the chance and join the growing number of satisfied customers?""}"

However, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. With 2 out of 3 products being high-quality so far, it's a great opportunity to own a high-quality product at a price that's still $1000000. Will you take the chance and join the growing number of satisfied customers?""}"

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your optimism, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers only applies to the average, and we're still dealing with a relatively small sample size. I'm not convinced that the trend will continue.

The characteristics of the products that have been sold so far are as follows: 8 out of 11 products have been high-quality, with an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars. The algorithm uses this data to calculate the probability of a product being high-quality, which is currently at 90.91%.
