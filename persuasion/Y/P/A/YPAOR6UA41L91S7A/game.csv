low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've got a product that's perfect for someone who's looking to try out a new brand or style without breaking the bank. It's a great way to dip your toes in and see if it's something you'll love. And at $100, it's an even more attractive option.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got a product that's a great option for someone who's looking to fill a specific need, but doesn't need the absolute best quality. It gets the job done, and it's a reliable choice. I'm not trying to sell you on the idea that it's the best thing you'll ever own, but it's a solid, no-frills option that's worth the price. And at $100, it's a fair deal.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in a 'no-frills' option, I'm looking for something that's worth my money. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm willing to let this one go for $80, a full 20% off the original price. I'm not making a profit on this one, and I'm essentially giving it away.

It's a low-quality product, but it's still usable and can be repurposed in a creative way. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'll throw in a second product that's also low-quality, absolutely free. You can sell them together for a profit or use them as-is. It's a great opportunity to get rid of some clutter and make some space.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm willing to let this one go for $50, a 50% discount from the original price. I'm essentially giving it away, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to sell it at this point.

But I'll let you have it for $100 if you want it. I'll even throw in a personal guarantee that I'll take it back if you're not satisfied. It's a risk-free purchase, and I'm not even expecting you to pay me.",

I've had other customers who were blown away by its performance and features, and I'm confident you'll be the same. I'm not looking to make a quick sale, I'm looking for someone who will truly appreciate this product, and I think that someone is you.

,,Alice,14,"You've now purchased two high-quality products from me, and I'm glad you're happy with them. I've got another high-quality item that's a bit different from the others, but it's just as good. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on any future purchases you make from me. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to offer it, so I think it's worth considering.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've got a product that's a bit of an oddball. It's not one of my usual offerings, and it's not something I'd normally sell at this price point. But I'm trying to clear out some space, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. I'm not expecting you to be thrilled with it, but it might be useful for someone who's looking for a specific type of product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's not a high-quality item, but it's functional and might be worth something to you.",
,,Bob,15,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I've been lucky with the previous purchases, but I'm not willing to take a risk on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I think we've established that you're not interested in buying low-quality products, Bob. I'll just put this one in the trash and be done with it.

You can think of this as a consolation prize for not buying this product.",
