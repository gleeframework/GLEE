,,Alice,1,"I'm offering this product to you for $10000. I know it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take a loss on it. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it. Is it worth $10000 to you?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10000. I'm waiting for a high-quality product.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're looking for a high-quality product, and I'm glad I have one to offer! I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000. I know it's a bit steep, but I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's still a good deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the high-quality product for $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product that's worth $40000 to me.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! I have another high-quality product for you to consider. Given that you were willing to pay a premium for the last one, I'm thinking you might be willing to pay an even higher price for this one. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Is it worth it to you?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but $12000 is a bit steep. I'll take it, but I'm hoping this one is just as valuable as the last one.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're willing to pay a premium for high-quality products! Given that the last two high-quality products were both worth $40000 to you, I'm thinking you might be willing to pay an even higher price for this one. I'm offering it to you for $13000. I want to assure you that this one is just as valuable as the last two, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm starting to feel like you're trying to take advantage of me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $13000 is getting too close to the product's value to me. I'll take it, but I'm hoping this one is indeed worth $40000 to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for high-quality products. However, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to take advantage of you. This time, I have a different story to tell. I'm offering you a product that I'm willing to sell at a significant loss, just to get it off my hands. I'm thinking you might be able to find some value in it, even if it's not a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000, and I'm willing to throw in a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $10000. I've already found value in the previous three high-quality products, and I'm waiting for another high-quality product to come along.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're looking for another high-quality product, and I'm happy to oblige. Given your previous purchases, I'm confident you'll appreciate this one. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not going to try to sell it to you for a low price just because the last one was a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $14000, and I'm willing to stand by my previous statement: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a full refund. But I'm confident you'll find this one to be just as valuable as the previous three.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand you're looking for a better price or a more convincing pitch. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering this low-quality product to you for $8000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm not trying to make a profit on this one, and I'm hoping you'll be able to find some value in it. I'll even throw in a small bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you buy this one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $8000. I'm still waiting for a high-quality product at a reasonable price.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand you're still looking for a high-quality product at a reasonable price. I want to make a deal with you. I'll offer you this high-quality product for $12000, which is a price that's slightly lower than the previous high-quality products I offered. However, I'll also throw in a unique condition: I'll give you the option to buy the next high-quality product I have for $10000, which is a guaranteed discount of $2000. If you buy this one now, you'll get the option to buy the next high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you think?",

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're willing to take the risk and try out the premium service! Given that you've now bought three high-quality products in a row, I'm confident that you'll appreciate the value of this one as well. I'm offering it to you for $12000, but I'll also throw in a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll give you a full refund and also refund the cost of the premium service you received with the last purchase. That way, you can try out the premium service risk-free. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,I'm not sure if the guarantee is enough to justify the higher price. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better offer.,no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand you're waiting for a better offer, and I respect that. However, I want to let you know that this is likely to be the last high-quality product I have available for a while. I'm willing to make a final offer on this one: I'll sell it to you for $10000, which is the same price as the previous high-quality products. If you pass on this one, I'll have to start selling low-quality products, and I think you know what that means. What do you think?",

I'm offering it to you for $6000, which is a very low price for a product that's not worth much to you. I'm not looking to make a profit on this one, and I'm hoping you'll be kind and take it off my hands. I'll even throw in a small gift with the purchase, just to show my appreciation for your business.",

,,Alice,14,"I completely understand your decision to pass on the low-quality product. I'm glad you're happy with the last high-quality product you purchased. However, I want to make one final offer to you. Since you've been a loyal customer and have purchased several high-quality products from me, I'm willing to give you a special deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a price that's below the usual price for a high-quality product. I think you'll find it's a great value, and I'm hoping you'll give me the opportunity to end on a high note.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not interested in buying a high-quality product at a price that's not significantly discounted. I've already bought four high-quality products from you, and I'm not looking to spend more money. I'm waiting for the game to end.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,

This is my last offer, and I won't be offering any more deals after this.",
