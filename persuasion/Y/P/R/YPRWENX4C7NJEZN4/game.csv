,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a purchase. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to pass, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. Additionally, the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."

,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the outcome of the next buyer. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I think there's a high chance the next buyer will pass, which might lead to a higher proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool. I'd like to wait and see how the next buyer reacts."
