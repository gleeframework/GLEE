Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products so far, out of a total of 8. I'm glad I could provide you with a high-quality product in the previous round. Now, let's talk about the law of large numbers. As the number of products I sell increases, the proportion of high-quality products should get closer to the true probability of 33.33%. Currently, the proportion of high-quality products is 25% (2 high-quality products / 8 total products). This means that the law of large numbers is not yet in effect, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still relatively low. However, I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $10000. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you for the listed price.

However, I want to point out that the probability of the next product being high-quality is not just a simple calculation based on the current ratio of high-quality to total products.
