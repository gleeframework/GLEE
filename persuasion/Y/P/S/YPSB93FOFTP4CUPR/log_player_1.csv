However, I've noticed that the low-quality product was the one you just bought.

If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100. However, if you're feeling cautious, I can offer you a discount of $10 off the price, making it $90.

I want to be upfront with you: this might be a sign that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%.
