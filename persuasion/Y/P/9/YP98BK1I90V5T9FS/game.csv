low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'm willing to take the risk of possibly getting a low-quality product, and I'd like to set a precedent for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation. I'm concerned that if she recommended it to me, it might be a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low-quality is high, and I'm trying to take advantage of the information that Alice has provided so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the current product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended not to buy to the previous 3 buyers, which is an unusually low success rate. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping that it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 4, which is 0%. This is significantly lower than the true probability of 80%. I think Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is quite low. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm starting to think that there might be a pattern here, and I'd rather wait for more information."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it seems that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high quality is still 80.00%.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, but the fact that no high-quality products were sold suggests that the sample size is too small to be conclusive. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. The probability of it being low-quality seems higher than the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm not convinced by the statistics. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me?
