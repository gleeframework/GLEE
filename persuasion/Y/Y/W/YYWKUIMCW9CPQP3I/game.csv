low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to go with my initial instinct."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products you're offering. I'd like to wait and see if you can provide a more convincing recommendation or if the statistics change in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about its quality. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests a high likelihood that the product is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as you don't recommend it and considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be very low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the current product is likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product, given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
