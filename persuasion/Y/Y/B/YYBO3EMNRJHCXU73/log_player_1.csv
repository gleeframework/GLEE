"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the expected value of the product for Bob is:

* 0.8 * $1,250,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $1,000,000

This expected value is equal to the selling price. Therefore, Bob is indifferent between buying and not buying the product. However, given the high probability of the product being high-quality, it is recommended to **buy** the product."
"Bob's message: I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision in round 1 doesn't change the situation in round 2.  Bob still doesn't know the quality of the product in round 2, and the expected value remains the same:

* 0.8 * $1,250,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $1,000,000

This is equal to the selling price.  While Bob is still indifferent, recommending buying the product remains the best strategy, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80%."

* 0.8 * $0 (value of low-quality product) + 0.2 * $1,250,000 (value of high-quality product) = $250,000

This is significantly less than the selling price of $1,000,000. Therefore, you should **not** recommend Bob to buy the product."
