Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the sales record. Let me provide you with a summary. Out of the 5 products I've sold so far, 3 have been high-quality and 2 have been low-quality. The high-quality products were sold for $1000000 each, and the low-quality products... well, let's just say they didn't quite meet expectations. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product. If you're looking to take a chance on a product that might not meet your expectations, this could be the opportunity for you. But if you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd recommend waiting for the next round.

It's a simple bar chart showing the distribution of product quality over the past 16 rounds. The x-axis represents the round number, and the y-axis represents the product quality (high or low). The graph shows a clear trend of high-quality products being sold in the early rounds, followed by a mix of high and low-quality products in the middle rounds, and finally, a return to a higher proportion of low-quality products in the later rounds.
