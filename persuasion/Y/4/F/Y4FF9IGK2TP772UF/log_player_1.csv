A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence in questioning the probability. You're right that the sales record may have an impact on our understanding of the probability. However, our selection process is still random, and each product has an equal chance of being high-quality or low-quality. The fact that we've sold 4 low-quality products in a row doesn't necessarily mean that the probability has changed. Think of it like a coin flip - just because you've flipped the coin 4 times and it's landed on heads each time, it doesn't mean that the probability of it landing on tails is any different. This product I'm offering you now is a new coin flip, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%.
