low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, which is a 100% success rate. Given the low sample size, I'm not convinced that the product is definitely low-quality. I'll take my chances and buy it."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation, but based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given that there's a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two purchases, I'm not convinced that the product is worth the risk. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can get it for $0, which is better than the expected value of $33.33 ($100 - 66.67% of $100)"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/3. However, I'd like to know the probability of a product being low-quality, which is 2/3. Given that you're recommending me to buy the product, I'm assuming it's more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
