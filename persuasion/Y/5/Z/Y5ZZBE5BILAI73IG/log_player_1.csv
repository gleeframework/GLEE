Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Since Bob has already bought one high-quality product, he now has a 75% chance that the next product is high-quality (since the probability of the first product being high-quality is 50%, and the probability of the second product being high-quality is 50% as well). I'll take advantage of this updated probability.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"Bob's message: I'll buy the product, since I know the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and it's worth $1250000 to me, which is a good deal compared to the price of $1000000.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
