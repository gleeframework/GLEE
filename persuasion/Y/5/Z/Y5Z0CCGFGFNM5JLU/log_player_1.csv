Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","Now that Bob has bought the low-quality product, he thinks it's more likely to be low-quality. This changes the probability in his mind. 

Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and he has already bought one low-quality product, he now thinks the probability of a product being high-quality is 25% (1 - (1 - 0.3333)^2).

With this updated probability, I'll make my recommendation:
