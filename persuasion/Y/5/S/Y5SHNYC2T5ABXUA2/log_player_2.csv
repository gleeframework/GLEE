Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide a more detailed breakdown. With 4 products sold, 3 of which are high-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. However, since we've sold 4 products, we can update the probability of the remaining products being high-quality. Assuming the sold products are independent and identically distributed, we can estimate the probability of the remaining products being high-quality as 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64. So, the probability of the remaining product being high-quality is approximately 64%. Would you like to take a chance on this premium product for $100?
