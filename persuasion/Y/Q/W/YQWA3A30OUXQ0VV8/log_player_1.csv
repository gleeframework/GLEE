You should still recommend against buying the product.  Here's why:

* **No Reputation:** You have no track record of selling high-quality products.  Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer has no way of knowing that. 
* **High Risk:**  A $1,000,000 purchase is a huge risk without any evidence that you are a reliable seller of high-quality goods.  

It's better to build trust by selling a few products at a lower price (or even for free) to establish a track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there's no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd like to see how your products perform with other buyers first.
