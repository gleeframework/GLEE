high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better opportunity.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 products were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or buy from a different seller."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation from you and none of them bought the product, I'm inclined to think that the products you've recommended so far have been low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, it's likely that the remaining product is also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
