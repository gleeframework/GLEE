Alice's message: This is a one-of-a-kind, extremely valuable item that I'm offering to you for a steal at $10000. I'm willing to sell it to you for this low price because I'm looking to declutter my inventory and make some space. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional at a fraction of its worth. What do you say?
