high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product and get a better understanding of the distribution of product quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not find the product worth buying, and all of them were recommended to buy, I suspect that all previous products were low-quality. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that you don't have any information about the product's quality."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which suggests a very high likelihood that this product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. Alice's recommendation not to buy is not a strong indicator, so I'll pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, I'm surprised you don't recommend buying.
