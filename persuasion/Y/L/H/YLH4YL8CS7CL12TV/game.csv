,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since I'm the first one and there's no prior information to go by."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, I think the low-quality products are more likely to be sold given the current statistics."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the products Alice has been offering have been low-quality, and I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the current statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which is a good deal considering its true worth of $40000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think the lack of high-quality products sold so far is significant enough to change my assessment of the product's value."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if I can get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to try my luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer has a better luck."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry to my advantage."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I'm trying to challenge the assumption that Alice's recommendation is reliable. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not doing it because I trust your judgment, Alice."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 7 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous products were low quality, I suspect that the probability of this product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers purchased the product, I'm going to assume that all of them received low-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall average of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that hasn't been touched yet, hoping to get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.
