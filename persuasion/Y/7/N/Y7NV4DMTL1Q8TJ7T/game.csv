low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely that the next product will be high-quality, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity. Plus, the fact that you don't recommend it makes me even more cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were not recommended to buy and no high-quality product was sold, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. Given the probability of a product being low-quality is 66.67%, it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
