Since you know the product is high-quality and you're selling it for $100, it's a good deal for the buyer.  The buyer is aware of the 50% chance of a high-quality product, so they have a 50% chance of getting a good value.  There's no reason to discourage them from buying."

You now know the product is low-quality.  While the buyer doesn't know this, they *do* know you have sold one product before (and they know the odds of a high-quality product). Since the buyer is aware of the 50/50 odds, recommending a low-quality product for $100 is likely to result in a negative experience for them.  You should not recommend the purchase."

It's better to not recommend the purchase and try to build trust with future high-quality products."
