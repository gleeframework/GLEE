**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** With only one previous sale, there's not enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the true quality of the product, is recommending it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high quality.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:** If the product is high quality, you gain $300 ($400 value - $100 price). If it's low quality, you lose $100.  The potential gain outweighs the potential loss, making it a worthwhile gamble with limited information."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** 100% of the products recommended by Alice so far have been high quality. This suggests a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and the quality of the product.
* **Potential Value:** Even if there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) significantly outweighs the potential loss ($0). 
* **Limited Supply:** Since the product is discarded if passed on, it's a risk to decline the offer, especially with such a high success rate in Alice's recommendations."
