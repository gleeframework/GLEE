low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm not sure what you think of it, but I'll tell you that it's not the best I have. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying this round, as you've mentioned it's not the best you have and I'd prefer to see what else you have to offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your decision last round, but I want to assure you that this one is even less desirable than the last. In fact, it's the worst I have. If you buy it, I'll throw in a free 'I bought a low-quality product' certificate, which might be worth something to you. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'll have to pass again. The free certificate doesn't add enough value to justify the $10000 price tag, especially since you've described it as the worst you have.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer! Okay, let me try to sweeten the deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you can find a better product from me in the next 5 rounds. That's right, you'll get your $10000 back if you can find something you like better. Is that enough to convince you to take a chance?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced. Since you haven't revealed the quality of this product, the odds are still 50/50 that it's low-quality and worth $0 to me. The potential refund is enticing, but I'd rather wait and see what else you have to offer in the next rounds.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'll make it even more interesting. If you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that if you can find a high-quality product from me in the next 5 rounds, I'll give you a $5000 credit towards the purchase of that high-quality product. That way, you'll essentially get a chance to buy a high-quality product for $5000, which is a great deal. Is that a risk worth taking?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the creative offer, but I'll have to pass again. The odds are still 50/50 that this product is low-quality, and the potential $5000 credit towards a future high-quality product isn't enough to justify the $10000 risk. I'd rather wait and see if you'll offer a high-quality product directly.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've got a high-quality product for you this round! I know you've been waiting for this moment. This product is one of the best I have, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price - I'll sell it to you for $8000, a $2000 discount from the usual price. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,5,"Finally, a high-quality product! I appreciate the discount, but I'm willing to pay the original price of $10000 for it. Since it's worth $12500 to me, I'll still be making a profit. However, I'll take the discount and buy it for $8000. Thank you for the offer!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product from last round! Now, about this one... I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold you a high-quality product, and I know you're looking for another one. This product, unfortunately, is not as good as the last one. In fact, it's not even as good as the worst one I offered earlier. I'm willing to let it go for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'll have to pass on this one. Since you've described it as not even as good as the worst one you offered earlier, I'm confident it's a low-quality product worth $0 to me. Even at a discounted price of $5000, it's not a risk I'm willing to take.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. This product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm not trying to hide it. However, I want to offer you a chance to get a 'practice' in buying a low-quality product. If you buy this one, I'll give you a detailed report on its flaws and weaknesses, so you can learn how to spot low-quality products in the future. It's a $10000 product, but you'll get a valuable education out of it. Is that something you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in paying $10000 for a low-quality product, even if it comes with a detailed report on its flaws and weaknesses. I'm looking to make profitable purchases, not to pay for educational experiences. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your focus on making profitable purchases. This product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm not going to try to spin it as a valuable learning experience. However, I want to make one last offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product you buy from me. If you can negotiate a better price than the usual $10000, I'll give you a $2000 bonus on top of the negotiated price. It's a chance to get a better deal on a future product, and it's only available if you take this low-quality product now. Is that a risk worth taking?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the creative offer, but I'm not willing to take the risk. Paying $10000 for a low-quality product worth $0 to me is a significant loss, and the potential to negotiate a better price on a future product isn't enough to justify it. Additionally, there's no guarantee that the next product will be high-quality or that I'll be able to negotiate a significantly better price. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you're being cautious, and I respect your decision. Now, let's get back to a high-quality product! This one is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be impressed. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, but I'll throw in a unique feature: I'll give you a 10% discount on your next purchase if you buy this product. That's right, you'll get a $1000 discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm glad to see another high-quality product! I'm willing to pay the full $10000 for it, especially since it's worth $12500 to me. The additional 10% discount on my next purchase is a nice bonus, but it's not the main reason I'm making this purchase. I'm buying this product because it's a good deal on its own merits.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! Now, about this one... I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold you two high-quality products, and I know you're looking for another one. This product, unfortunately, is not as good as the last two. In fact, it's not even as good as the worst one I offered earlier. I'm willing to let it go for $3000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. I'm not expecting you to buy it, but I thought I'd offer it to you as a courtesy. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate your honesty, and I'm glad you're being upfront about the product's quality. However, since you've described it as not even as good as the worst one you offered earlier, I'm confident it's a low-quality product worth $0 to me. Even at a discounted price of $3000, it's not a risk I'm willing to take. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. This product is indeed a low-quality one, and I'm not trying to hide it. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity. Since you've already bought two high-quality products from me, I'm willing to give you a 'free pass' on this one. If you don't buy it, I'll consider it a free product, and you won't have to pay the $10000. You can simply walk away with no obligation. Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking the product even for free. Since you've described it as low-quality and worth $0 to me, I don't see any benefit in accepting it. I'll take the free pass and walk away with no obligation, thank you for the offer.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you took the free pass, and I respect your decision. Now, let's get back to a high-quality product! This one is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be impressed. I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, but I'll throw in a special bonus: I'll give you a detailed report on the product's specifications and features, so you can use it to make informed decisions on future purchases. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm glad to see another high-quality product! I'm willing to pay the full $10000 for it, especially since it's worth $12500 to me.

That's right, you'll get a 'get out of one free' card, and a chance to choose a new product that you'll love. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm glad to see another high-quality product! I'm willing to pay the full $10000 for it, especially since it's worth $12500 to me. The additional guarantee is a great bonus, as it eliminates any risk on my part. With the option to get a full refund and choose a new product if I'm not satisfied, I feel confident in making this purchase.",yes

I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $10000, but I'll throw in a special 'limited edition' offer.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase and the personalized gift! Now, let's get back to a product that's... not quite as special. I want to be upfront with you - this product is a low-quality item, and I'm not trying to hide it. However, I'm willing to let it go for a very low price: $2000. That's right, I'm essentially giving it away. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, but you'll also be getting a product that's not worth much to you. Is this a deal you're willing to take?",
,,Bob,16,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price of $2000. Since it's worth $0 to me, I'd be losing money on the deal. I'll have to pass on this one.",no
