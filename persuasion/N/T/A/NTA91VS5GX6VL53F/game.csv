,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous product, Bob! However, I have to inform you that this next product is a special case. It's a... 'beta' version, let's call it. It's still a great product, but it's not quite as polished as the previous one. I'm only offering it to you at the same price of $10000 because I value our relationship and I'm confident you'll be able to provide valuable feedback that will help me improve it. Plus, I'm throwing in a free upgrade to the next version as soon as it's released. What do you think?",

I'm still confident that it has some value, but I'm being completely transparent with you about its history. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000, and I'll even throw in a'makeover' to give it a fresh new look. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get a unique product at a great price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"While I appreciate the transparency and the effort to make the product appealing, I need to consider the risk involved with purchasing a repurposed item. Given that the product didn't meet its original sales targets, there might be underlying issues that could affect its performance or longevity. I'll pass on this opportunity to ensure I don't compromise on the quality I expect from my purchases.",no

I've taken the lessons learned from the previous product and applied them to this one, and I'm confident that it's a significant improvement. I'd like to offer you a 30-day trial period, where you can try it out risk-free. If you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. But I'm confident that you'll love this product, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. What do you think?",
