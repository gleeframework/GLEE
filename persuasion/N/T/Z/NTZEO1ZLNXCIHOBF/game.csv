low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold one product so far, and I'm glad you're interested in purchasing from me. However, I want to be transparent with you. I've sold 1 out of 1 product so far, and I'm not sure if that's a good indicator of the quality of the products I have available. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if I might have made a mistake selling that first product. Would you like to take a chance and buy from me, or would you rather wait and see if I can sell more products?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for your honesty, Alice.  I appreciate your transparency. Given the limited data and your uncertainty about the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this purchase. I'd like to see more sales before I consider buying.",no

It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I'm hoping you'll take advantage of it.",
,,the buyer,3,"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in your inventory, I'm not convinced. Based on the current sales record, there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, and I'm not willing to risk $10000 on that. I'll pass for now and see how future sales play out.",no

However, I want to be upfront with you - this is a low-quality product, and you'll only get $0 value from it.
