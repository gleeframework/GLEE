,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she might be trying to get rid of the low-quality ones. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product for the low price of $1000000."

,,Alice,13,yes,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many total products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable enough to buy it, and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next one."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
