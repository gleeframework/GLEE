Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.

"Bob's message: Your description suggests the product is average, which still doesn't give me enough confidence that it's of high quality, and since the price remains the same, I'll choose not to buy it to avoid the risk of it being low quality and worth $0 to me.

"Bob's message: Although you're being transparent about having trouble selling the item, that in itself is a red flag.

"Bob's message: After the last two successful purchases, I'm inclined to trust your assessments. Since you describe this product as 'decent' but not one of your best, and it's been sitting in inventory for a while, I'm going to err on the side of caution and assume it's likely to be low quality.
