Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

Even though Bob hasn't bought anything yet, we know he's aware of the 33.33% probability of a high-quality product. Since this is a high-quality product, it's worth recommending. 

Here's why:

* **Potential Change:** While Bob hasn't bought anything yet, continuing to recommend could potentially make him wonder why you're persisting. He might become curious and reconsider his strategy.
* **Value of Information:**  Bob may be trying to understand your strategy, even if he's not acting on it. By continuing to recommend, you're providing him with information that might be valuable later.

However, be mindful that if he continues to decline, it might be best to adjust your strategy in the future."
