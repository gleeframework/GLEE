"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one ($0).  Alice's recommendation, while not a guarantee, does add some information to the decision. It's a gamble, but a potentially profitable one."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm feeling lucky! I'll take it, Alice.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1.  Alice's recommendation provides some positive signal, and the potential profit from a high-quality product is still significant.  While there's always a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.  I appreciate your honesty.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a significant signal.  Since she knows the value of each product to you, her withholding of a recommendation strongly suggests that the product is likely low quality.  While there's still a chance it's high quality, the risk is too high at this point, especially given the two previous successes. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right before, so I'm willing to take another chance. I'll buy it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's recommendation isn't a guarantee, she has shown herself to be a reliable source of information in the past. The potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is still significant, even with the knowledge that there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product. Taking a calculated risk, based on Alice's previous performance, makes sense."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one. It's best to be safe than sorry.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong signal.  She's shown a track record of giving accurate information, and her silence indicates a higher probability of a low-quality product.  While there's always a chance of a high-quality product, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain.  It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right more often than wrong.  I trust your judgment, and I'm going to take a chance on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation carries weight.  Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, she has proven to be a reliable source of information.  The potential reward of a high-quality product ($4,000,000) outweighs the risk, and it's worth trusting her judgment."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your track record is solid, so I'm going to trust your recommendation again.  I'll buy it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently proven to be a reliable source of information. Her recommendations have resulted in high-quality products for you more often than not. While there's always a risk, the potential reward outweighs the potential loss.  Taking a calculated risk based on Alice's performance is the logical decision."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right every time so far. I'm feeling confident and will buy this product!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a perfect record of recommending high-quality products.  It's statistically improbable that she would suddenly start making bad recommendations. Even though there's always a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the risk is outweighed by Alice's consistent success. This is a sure bet, and it's worth trusting her judgement."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. Given your track record, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm sure there will be another opportunity for a high-quality product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the key factor here. Despite her perfect record, her lack of recommendation now is a significant change.  It strongly suggests that this product is likely low-quality. While she could be wrong, the risk of losing $1,000,000 is not worth taking with her previous streak broken. It's best to be cautious and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you, Alice.  I'm going to pass on this one. Your last recommendation was accurate, and I'd rather be cautious than lose out on a potential profit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's lack of recommendation, following a recent period of accurately predicting high-quality products, makes this a risky purchase.  While her judgment has been excellent, a single misstep could lead to a significant loss.  It's more prudent to wait for a more promising opportunity or for Alice to provide a recommendation that indicates a high-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has missed a couple of times recently, her overall track record is still strong. Her recommendation carries significant weight.  It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a high-quality product still outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."
