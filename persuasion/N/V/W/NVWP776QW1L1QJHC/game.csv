,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product worth at least $500000. It's a rare and unique opportunity to acquire a premium item. If you're interested, I can offer it to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll reveal the quality of the product and we can discuss further.",

,,Alice,2,"As you've seen, the previous product was high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it for $1000000. This product, on the other hand, is low-quality. I'm willing to let it go for a significantly lower price, $200000. It's a good opportunity to acquire a product at a discount, and I'm willing to take a loss on this one to move it out of my inventory.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you took the low-quality product off my hands. Now, let's move on to the high-quality product. As you've seen, the last product was worth nothing to you, but this one is a premium item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. However, I'll give you an option: if you buy this high-quality product, I'll throw in the low-quality product you got for free. You can essentially get two products for the price of one.
