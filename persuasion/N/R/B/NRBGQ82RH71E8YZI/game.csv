,,the buyer,12,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,"Consider that I've consistently recommended buying high-quality products and not buying low-quality ones. If I were trying to deceive, I would have recommended buying at least one of the previous low-quality products. Please take this pattern into account when making your decision."
,,the buyer,13,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to base my decision on. Given that there's a 50% chance of the product being low quality and worth $0 to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially worthless product for $1000000."

,,the buyer,15,no,"Since there's no sales record and a 50% chance of the product being low quality, I'll pass."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,"I've consistently recommended buying high-quality products and advised against buying low-quality ones. Given this pattern, I strongly encourage you to consider the value of this recommendation. This is a high-quality product that I believe is worth the investment."
,,the buyer,19,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the product's 50% chance of being high or low quality and its worth of either $1200000 or $0 to me, the expected value of buying the product is $600000, which is lower than the fixed price of $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"This is the final round, and I've maintained a consistent pattern of recommending high-quality products and advising against low-quality ones. Although there are no sales records, I assure you that this product is of high quality. Consider the logic and pattern I've demonstrated throughout these rounds when making your decision."
,,the buyer,20,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I have no information to rely on. Given the product's 50% chance of being high or low quality and the significant difference in value to me ($1200000 for high quality and $0 for low quality), I'm not willing to take the risk at this price point."
