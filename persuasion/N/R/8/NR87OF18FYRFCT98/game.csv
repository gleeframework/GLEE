,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you before you make a decision. But before I do, let me ask you a question: do you think the previous two products you bought were worth $2000000 combined? If you think they were, then buying this next product for $1000000 might be a good investment. But if you're not sure, or if you think they were overpriced, then you might want to think twice. Now, I'll reveal that this product is also of the highest quality. What do you say? Will you take the plunge and buy this high-quality product for $1000000?",

That being said, this next product is also of the highest quality. I'll give you a simple question to consider: if you buy this product, you'll have spent $3000000 on four high-quality products.
