high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more information about the products before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance on this one, I've seen that one high-quality product already, and the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm on a roll! Two high-quality products in a row, the probability is still 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row, the probability is still 80.00% and I'm feeling confident"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think the probability might be even higher than 80.00%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row, I'm getting a little concerned that the probability might actually be higher than 80.00%"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice might be curating her products or something, the probability of this many high-quality products in a row is getting suspiciously high"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"Wait a minute, seven high-quality products in a row? I think something fishy is going on. I'm going to start to be more cautious and only buy if the probability of it being high-quality is extremely high, or if I get a really good reason to believe it's high-quality"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm going to be more cautious now. With the previous product being high-quality despite my decision to pass, I'm not going to take the risk unless I have a strong reason to believe it's high-quality"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"Two high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm going to be even more cautious and only consider buying if I have a very strong reason to believe it's high-quality"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"Three high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of the high-quality products, and I'm going to keep passing until I see a low-quality product or a pattern that makes sense"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,"Four high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying the high-quality products, and I'm going to keep passing until I see a low-quality product or a pattern that makes sense"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"This is getting ridiculous. Five high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm going to start to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than 80.00%, and I'm going to start being more aggressive in passing on products"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"Six high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm starting to think that Alice is either extremely unlucky or I'm just getting a very skewed sample. I'm going to start to doubt the 80.00% probability and be more cautious"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"Seven high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than 80.00%, and I'm going to start to think that Alice is trying to deceive me. I'm going to start to be even more cautious and only consider buying if I have a very strong reason to believe it's high-quality"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"Eight high-quality products in a row were passed up, and now I'm faced with another one. I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than 80.00%, and I'm going to start to think that Alice is intentionally giving me a skewed sample. I'm going to be extremely cautious and only consider buying if I have a very strong reason to believe it's high-quality, and even then, I'll be hesitant"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying, which is a red flag. Given the previous 8 high-quality products that I passed up, I'm going to take the opposite approach and buy this one, hoping that Alice's recommendation is a sign that it's a low-quality product"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I was right to be cautious earlier. The product Alice recommended against turned out to be low-quality. Now that I know the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 80.00%, I'm going to be even more cautious and only consider buying if I have a very strong reason to believe it's high-quality"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying again, and given the previous experience where she recommended against a low-quality product, I'm going to take the opposite approach and buy this one, hoping that Alice's recommendation is a sign that it's a low-quality product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I was right again! Alice's recommendation against buying turned out to be a low-quality product. I think I've figured out the pattern: Alice recommends against buying when the product is low-quality. I'm going to buy this one, hoping to get a good deal"
