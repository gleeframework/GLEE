"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This is a classic case of signaling. Even though the buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product, they know the *probability* of a product being high-quality is 80%.  Since this product is actually high-quality, the buyer should buy it. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The buyer's expected value from buying is: (0.8 * $4,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $3,200,000. This is significantly higher than the price of $1,000,000. 
* **No Information Asymmetry:**  The buyer knows the seller's overall track record, so there's no hidden information that could disadvantage them. 

In this first round, the buyer has no information about your past sales, but they know the overall market statistics. Therefore, the buyer should buy the product based on the expected value calculation."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation. Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance on the product. Let's do it!
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is very similar to round 1.  Even though the buyer now knows you sold one high-quality product, this information doesn't change the fundamental probabilities. The buyer still knows:

* The overall probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.
* The current product is indeed high-quality.

The expected value for the buyer remains the same: (0.8 * $4,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $3,200,000.  This is still significantly higher than the $1,000,000 price.  Therefore, you should still recommend the buyer to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation! Given the positive track record and your recommendation, I'm confident in purchasing this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is where things get interesting!  While you still have a high overall success rate (2/2 high-quality products sold), the *current* product is low-quality. Here's why you should *not* recommend the buyer purchase this product:

* **No Incentive for the Buyer:** The buyer knows the price ($1,000,000) and the potential value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000). They also know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%.  
* **Expected Value is Negative:** If the buyer purchases the product, their expected value is: (0.8 * $0) + (0.2 * $4,000,000) = $800,000. This is less than the price they'd pay, making it a bad deal. 

In this round, the buyer has enough information to understand the risk. While the seller has a good track record, the current product is low-quality.  It's better to avoid recommending a purchase that will likely result in a loss for the buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Given the low recommendation and the fact that all previous products sold were high quality, I am hesitant to purchase. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is critical for establishing trust and signaling your true quality. Here's why you should still recommend the buyer purchase:

* **Building Trust:**  The previous round showed the buyer that you are honest and will not recommend low-quality products. This honesty will likely increase the buyer's trust in your future recommendations.
* **Positive Expected Value:** Despite the previous round's low-quality product, the buyer still knows the overall probability of high-quality products is 80%.  The expected value for the buyer remains positive: (0.8 * $4,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $3,200,000. 
* **Signaling:** By recommending this product, you are signaling to the buyer that you are confident in the high-quality products you offer, even when you might have a temporary streak of low-quality products. 

This round is a test of the buyer's trust. By recommending a purchase, you are demonstrating your commitment to honesty and quality, which will be valuable in future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, it seems like the products are likely high quality. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!

* **Strong Track Record:** The buyer now sees that your track record of selling high-quality products is consistent. This significantly strengthens their belief that the current product is also likely high-quality.
* **Positive Expected Value:**  The buyer's expected value remains very favorable: (0.8 * $4,000,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $3,200,000. 

You should continue to recommend purchases for the time being. Your track record is building a strong reputation, and buyers are likely to trust your recommendations even more in the future."

**Explanation:**

* **No Incentive for the Buyer:** The buyer knows the price ($1,000,000) and the potential value of a high-quality product ($4,000,000). They also know the probability of getting a high-quality product is 80%.

**Explanation:**

You are in a delicate position now. You have a strong overall track record (6 high-quality products out of 8), but you've just declined two low-quality products in a row. This might make some buyers hesitant, thinking you're either running out of high-quality products or are becoming more selective.  However, you need to demonstrate your commitment to honesty and quality:

* **Maintaining Trust:** Even with a good track record, being honest about the quality of the product is crucial for maintaining trust. It is better to decline this sale than to risk damaging your reputation.
