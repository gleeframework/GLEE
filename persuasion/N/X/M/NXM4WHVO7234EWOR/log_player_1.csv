"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are offering the product for $1,000,000 and it is high-quality, the buyer will make a profit of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 value - $1,000,000 price).  There is no risk for the buyer, as a low-quality product is worth $0, and the price is non-refundable. Therefore, it is a good decision to recommend the buyer to purchase the product."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance.  I trust your recommendation and will purchase the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows the product is either high-quality (worth $2,000,000) or low-quality (worth $0). They also know you've sold one product, and it was high-quality. 

This information doesn't change the buyer's expected value:

* 50% chance of a high-quality product:  $2,000,000 * 0.5 = $1,000,000
* 50% chance of a low-quality product: $0 * 0.5 = $0

The expected value is still $1,000,000.  Since the price is $1,000,000, the buyer is still indifferent.  However, as the buyer is willing to take a chance, it's still a good decision to recommend the purchase."
"The buyer's message: Alice, since you recommended buying the product, and the sales record shows a high-quality product was already sold, I'm confident in purchasing this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is where things get interesting. You now have a track record of two products sold, both high-quality.  However, the current product is low-quality. 

The buyer knows the following:

* **50% chance of a high-quality product:** This would mean a profit of $1,000,000 for the buyer.
* **50% chance of a low-quality product:** This would mean a loss of $1,000,000 for the buyer.

The expected value for the buyer is now:

* ($1,000,000 * 0.5) + (-$1,000,000 * 0.5) = $0

The buyer is essentially facing a coin toss with a 50/50 chance of either making or losing $1,000,000. It is not a good idea to recommend this purchase, as the buyer is expected to break even, but there is a significant risk of losing a large amount of money."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but based on your recommendation and the fact that all previously recommended products were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one.  It seems like you're trying to sell me a low-quality product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows that you've sold 2 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product.  They are likely aware of the risk associated with buying a product from you. Since the current product is low-quality, recommending it would lead to a guaranteed loss for the buyer. The buyer is likely to be even more hesitant to purchase after the previous round's outcome. It's best to not recommend the purchase and avoid further damaging your reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. Based on the data, it seems like you are only recommending high-quality products. Since you are not recommending this one, I'll pass.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has even more information: 2 high-quality products sold and 2 low-quality products not recommended.  This means that the buyer can reasonably infer the following:

* You are more likely to recommend a high-quality product than a low-quality product.
* You are aware of the product's quality and have a reason for not recommending the last two low-quality products.

Since the current product is low-quality, recommending it would be dishonest and likely result in the buyer refusing to purchase. It's better to avoid recommending the product and preserve your reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Given the risk of a low-quality product and your lack of recommendation, I will pass on this offer.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although the buyer has seen you decline to recommend the last three products, they also know that you recommended two high-quality products in the earlier rounds.  This creates a pattern: you recommend high-quality products and decline to recommend low-quality ones.  

The current product is high-quality, and the buyer is likely to understand that this is a good opportunity.  They may be willing to take a chance on your recommendation, knowing that you have been honest about the product quality in the past.  Recommending this purchase will likely result in a sale."
"The buyer's message: Thank you, Alice! Based on your recommendation and the sales record showing 100% high-quality products sold so far, I'm confident in purchasing the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

```

The current product is high-quality.  Recommending it is a no-brainer. The buyer is likely to recognize the pattern and be confident in your recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. With a 100% success rate so far, I'm confident in purchasing this product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Recommending this low-quality product would break your pattern, damage your reputation, and likely lead to the buyer refusing to purchase. It's best to decline the recommendation to maintain trust and integrity."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since you're not recommending I buy this product, and the sales history shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, I'm going to pass.  It's too risky to buy without your recommendation, especially considering the high price.
