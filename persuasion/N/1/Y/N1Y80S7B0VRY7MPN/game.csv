,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation from you, Alice. Can you explain why you're not recommending this product? Is there something I should know about its quality?"

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. I'd like to see more sales and get a better sense of the product quality before making a decision.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision, considering the previous sales record."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only one high-quality product sold out of two products, which is a 50% success rate. Given the low quality probability of 20%, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can take advantage of the low probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 2 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm not confident that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since I know the probability of a high-quality product is only 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product, and both were high-quality, I suspect that Alice may be recommending low-quality products to buyers who are likely to purchase, in order to increase the probability of selling more low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a situation where the recommendation is less likely to be biased."
