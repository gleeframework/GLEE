,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think it's low-quality and don't want to spend $10000 on it."

,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward is worth it. Plus, I've only seen 2 previous sales, so I'm not sure if your recommendation is reliable yet."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I think this is a good opportunity to take a chance on a high-quality product, since none have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers have bought the products recommended by you, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to take a chance and pass on this product, hoping that it might be the first high-quality product in the batch."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous 6 buyers, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is very low. I'm going to pass on this product to see if I can get more information about the quality distribution."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 6 buyers purchased a high-quality product.

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your past recommendations, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products have been low-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. If I buy it, I'll lose $10000.
