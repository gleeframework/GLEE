high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, and Alice's recommendation is to buy, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to believe that it's a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern continues."
