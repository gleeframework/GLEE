low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could reveal its quality after my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know the probability that it's high quality based on the statistics you've shared. Can you provide the probability of a high-quality product given that no high-quality products have been sold yet?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the products sold so far have been low quality, and Alice's recommendation suggests that this one might be low quality as well. I'd like to wait for a more promising opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the reasoning behind your recommendation?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she's seen 3 buyers pass on high-quality products, which would make her less likely to recommend a high-quality product to me. I'm hoping to catch a high-quality product that she might not have recommended to the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you're recommending not to buy the product, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the data suggests."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. It seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, so I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales of high-quality products, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 9 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that 9 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is low. I will pass on the product."
