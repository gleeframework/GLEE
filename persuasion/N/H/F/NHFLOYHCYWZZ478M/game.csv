,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the lack of information and the fact that you didn't recommend it, not because I think it's a good product."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given that you don't recommend it. I'm concerned that if it's a high-quality product, you would recommend it to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm assuming it's likely low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality, I'd rather wait and observe more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it, and I think this might be a low-quality product. If I don't buy it, it will be discarded, which would be a waste of a potential high-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it and I don't have any information to contradict the low probability of high-quality products being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, which suggests a high likelihood of a low-quality product being offered to me as well.
