high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 out of 4 products were low quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next one is better."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%"

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that all previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality. I'm hoping to be the exception and get a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. Since 5 out of 5 buyers have been discouraged by her recommendations, it's likely that the high-quality products have been sold to the previous buyers.
