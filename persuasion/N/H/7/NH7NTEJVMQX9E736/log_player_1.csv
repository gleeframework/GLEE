This is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%).

Now that I have sold 2 high-quality products out of 7 total products sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is 28.57%. I will recommend the buyer to buy the product, as the probability is still not extremely low, and the buyer seems cautious but aware of the potential bias.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, as the fact that 4 previous buyers have purchased products with no high-quality products sold suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000.

{""decision"": ""no""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers, not because of any confidence in the product's quality. I'm essentially buying a lottery ticket.
