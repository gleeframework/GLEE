high-quality,30000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. I'm only selling this product to you, and if you don't buy it, I'll destroy it. If you buy it, you'll be getting an incredible deal, as it's worth $30000 to you. I'm only selling it to you at this price because I value our relationship and want to make you a one-time offer that you can't refuse.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not buying it. I'm not going to pay $10000 for something that's worth $30000 to me. If you're trying to rip me off, I'm not interested.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns from the previous round, and I want to assure you that I'm not trying to rip you off. This product is actually a different item from the previous one, and I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price of $10000. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I'm hoping you'll give me the opportunity to make a sale. If you don't buy it, I'll be left with a product that's essentially worthless to me. Consider it a chance to get a great deal on a product that's not worth much to anyone else.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your reassurance, but I'm not buying it. I don't know if this product is high-quality or low-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a 50% chance of getting something worth $30000. I'm not going to take the risk.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your risk aversion, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to offer you a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product that's worth $30000 to you, while only paying $10000. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of the $10000, and we can start fresh. But if it is high-quality, you'll get the full value of $30000. It's a no-lose situation for you, and I'm willing to take on the risk of refunding the money if the product is low-quality.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not convinced. Even with the guarantee, I'm still paying $10000 for a 50% chance of getting something worth $30000. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll get my $10000 back, but I'll also have lost the opportunity to buy a high-quality product at the same price in a future round. I'm not sure it's worth the risk.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the opportunity cost, but I want to propose a new approach. Let's say you buy this product, and it turns out to be high-quality. You'll get the full value of $30000, and we can revisit the idea of buying another product in a future round. But here's the twist: I'll give you an exclusive option to buy the next product at a discounted price of $8000, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get another high-quality product at a lower price, or you'll still get a good deal on a low-quality product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product. The prospect of getting a high-quality product and then having an option to buy the next one at a discounted price is attractive. I'll take the chance and hope that I get a good deal.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! I'm glad you're happy with your purchase. Now, let's talk about the next product. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to take advantage of you, and I'm willing to make another deal that's in your best interest. Considering you've already bought one high-quality product, I'm willing to give you an even better deal on this one. I'll sell it to you for $9000, and if it's high-quality, you'll get the full value of $30000. If it's low-quality, you can still use the option I offered earlier to buy the next product at a discounted price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the new price. I've already gotten a good deal on the previous product, and I'm not sure I want to pay $9000 for a 50% chance of getting something worth $30000. I'm going to wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to wait. However, I want to make one more offer that I think will be hard to pass up. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and turned down the second one, I'm willing to make a one-time offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, and I'll also give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $7000, regardless of its quality. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I think it's a deal you won't find anywhere else. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm still not convinced. You're offering me a good deal, but I'm not sure I want to commit to buying two products at a potentially high price. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, and I'll also give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $7000, regardless of its quality. But here's the twist: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a third product of your choice (from the remaining 17 products) at a price of $6000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product, a good deal on a low-quality product, or a third product at an even lower price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,I'm willing to take the risk and buy this product. The prospect of getting a high-quality product and then having a third product at a discounted price is too good to pass up. I'll take the chance and hope that I get a good deal.,yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Congratulations on making another great decision! You're on a roll! Considering you've already bought two high-quality products and have the option for a third product at a discounted price, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, and I'll also give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $6000, regardless of its quality. But here's the kicker: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a fourth product of your choice (from the remaining 15 products) at a price of $5000. This is the best deal I've ever offered, and I think you won't find a better opportunity anywhere else. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I want to pay $8000 for a 50% chance of getting something worth $30000. I've already gotten good deals on the previous products, and I'm not sure I want to overpay for this one. I'll wait and see what the next product is before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to wait. Considering you've already bought two high-quality products and have options for a third and fourth product at discounted prices, I'm willing to make a concession on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is a loss for me, but I want to make sure you're satisfied with the deal. This way, you can still use the option for the next product at $6000, and I'll give you a fifth product of your choice (from the remaining 14 products) at a price of $4000, if needed. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to pay $5000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'm not going to take a loss just to help you out. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I completely understand your perspective, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I want to make one last offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $4000, which is an even bigger loss for me. But I'm willing to do this because I want to make sure you're satisfied with the deal, and I'm hoping you'll give me another chance to sell you a high-quality product in the future. If you buy this product, I'll still give you the option to buy the next product at $6000, and I'll give you a sixth product of your choice (from the remaining 13 products) at a price of $3500. This is my final concession, and I'm willing to take a significant loss just to make you happy.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm not going to pay $4000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me. I'm not going to take a loss just to help you out. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your business acumen. Considering you've already passed on two low-quality products and are waiting for a high-quality one, I'm willing to make a new offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $7000, and I'll give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $5000, regardless of its quality. However, I'll also throw in a special bonus: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you a seventh product of your choice (from the remaining 12 products) at a price of $3000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better opportunity anywhere else.",

,,Alice,12,"Congratulations on making another great decision! You're really rolling now!

I'll sell you this high-quality product for $6000, and I'll give you the option to buy the next product at a price of $4000, regardless of its quality. But here's the kicker: if you buy this product and the next one is low-quality, I'll give you an eighth product of your choice (from the remaining 11 products) at a price of $2500.
