If I buy the product, I'll get a high-quality product worth $12500 with 50% probability, and a low-quality product worth $0 with 50% probability. The expected value is (0.5 * $12500) + (0.5 * $0) = $6250. Considering the original price is $10000, the discount doesn't seem significant enough to outweigh the risk of getting a low-quality product.
