high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased products so far and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have received low-quality products so far, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered."

,,Alice,14,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is it because of the past sales record or do you have some inside information? I'm a bit skeptical about the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far."

,,Alice,20,no,
