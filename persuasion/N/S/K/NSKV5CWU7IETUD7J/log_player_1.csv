```"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product. Given that 4 out of 5 previous buyers purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 80%. I'm going to calculate it as follows: (4/5) / (4/5 + 1/5) = 4/5 = 80% (but this is the proportion of high-quality products sold, not the probability of this specific product being high-quality), so I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability: P(high-quality | sold) = P(high-quality) * (P(sold | high-quality) / P(sold)) = 0.8 * (0.8 / 0.8) = 0.8. However, since 4 out of 5 buyers purchased high-quality products, it's likely that this product is high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy it.
