low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm looking to sell it to you for $100. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, which means I have a 0% success rate. I'm not sure what this product is worth to you, but I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you for a fixed price of $100. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a better deal in the future.",
,,the buyer,1,I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. My success rate is still 0%. I'm offering you this product for $100, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. However, I'm willing to provide you with a bit more information: if I had a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, given how eager the previous buyer was. This product is still available for $100, and it's a one-time offer.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the additional information. Given the low success rate and the fact that you mentioned you would have sold a high-quality product if you had one, I believe the risk is manageable. I'll take the product for $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen that I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, and my success rate is still 0%. I want to emphasize that I'm not trying to hide anything from you. If I had a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, and I would have likely sold it to the previous buyer who was eager to take the risk. Since I'm still offering you this product for $100, it's likely that it's another low-quality one. You're my third potential buyer, and I'm not getting any younger...",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for your honesty and transparency, Alice. Given the statistics and the fact that you've sold two low-quality products in a row, I am choosing to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your efforts and hope to see you succeed soon with a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I appreciate your honesty as well! It's clear that you're a savvy buyer who values transparency. I'll give you a bit more information: I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, and I've had 2 opportunities to sell a high-quality product so far. Since you know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that I have a high-quality product in my inventory, but it's not being offered to you. I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a better deal in the future.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"It seems like I'm having a bit of a streak here. 3 low-quality products in a row. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm actually starting to wonder if I'm just really bad at selling high-quality products or if there's something going on with my inventory. Either way, I'm offering you this low-quality product for $100. I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to make a sale. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take the risk of selling it to you.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think I've established a pattern here. 4 low-quality products in a row. I want to ask you a question: do you think I'm just really bad at selling high-quality products, or do you think I'm just trying to get rid of these low-quality products? Either way, I'm offering you this one for $100. I'm not getting any younger, and I really need to make a sale. If I had a high-quality product, I would have sold it by now, and I would have likely sold it to the previous buyer who was willing to take the risk. This one's still available for $100.",

I'm not sure what this product is worth to you, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I've learned from my previous mistakes, and I'm trying to be more transparent. I've got a mix of high-quality and low-quality products in my inventory, and I'm not sure which one you'll get. But I'm hoping that this one is the good one. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a better deal in the future.",
