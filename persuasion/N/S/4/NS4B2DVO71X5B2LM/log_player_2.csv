**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a positive signal.
* **The statistics:**  One buyer bought a high-quality product. This is a very strong indicator that Alice's recommendations are accurate. 
* **The odds:**  While there's still a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the odds are in your favor with Alice's track record. The potential gain of $2,000 (if it's high-quality) outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 (if it's low-quality) in this case. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes that Alice is trying to maximize her sales. A dishonest Alice could manipulate the recommendations to her own benefit. However, given the limited information, it's a reasonable risk to take."
