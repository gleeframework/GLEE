,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability of low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it, which suggests it's likely low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice has an incentive to recommend high-quality products and is likely to pass on low-quality ones."
