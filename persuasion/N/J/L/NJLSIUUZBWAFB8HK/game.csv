,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide me with the probability of a product being high quality given that no high-quality products have been sold so far?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, and the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record, which is not very informative given the low number of sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers bought the products recommended by you, I'm inclined to think that the products were likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the expected value of buying is still $625000 (50% chance of high-quality product * $1250000 + 50% chance of low-quality product * $0)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't find the product valuable, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially benefit from a high-quality product."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there any information that led you to advise me against buying it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0 out of 6. I'm curious, are you basing your recommendation on the lack of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is very low. I'll pass on the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but the prior probability of the product being low-quality seems higher given the previous sales record."
