low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $500000. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price, but keep in mind that it's not the best quality. If you're interested, I can give you a brief description of its features.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll pass on this one, it's not worth $500000 to me, even at a discounted price.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I've had great feedback from other customers who have purchased similar products in the past. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fair price. If you're interested, I can provide more information about its features and benefits.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take it. $1000000 is a fair price for a high-quality product like this.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm offering you a second product for $1000000. I know what you paid for the previous high-quality product, and I'm willing to match that price for this one. I'm confident that you'll be able to see the value in this product, even if it's not as high-quality as the last one. It's a great opportunity to get a product at the same price as the last one, which you already know is worth $1000000.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in paying $1000000 for a product that's not guaranteed to be high-quality. The last one was a great deal, but I'm not willing to take that risk again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that I'm being transparent about the product's quality. I'm offering it to you for $750000, which is significantly lower than the previous product. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to demonstrate my commitment to building trust with you. If you're interested, I can also offer a 30-day return policy, so you can try it out and see if it meets your needs.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but even at $750000, I'm not willing to take a chance on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'm not interested in taking on the risk of losing $750000.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the risk, but I want to propose a different approach. I'll offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to win a second product, which will be revealed to you after you've purchased this one. The second product will be revealed to be either high-quality or low-quality, and if it's high-quality, you'll get to keep both products. If it's low-quality, you'll get to keep this product and I'll give you a full refund for the second product. The price for this 'lottery ticket' is $750000.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying a 'lottery ticket' for $750000. The expected value of the second product is still 33.33% chance of being worth $3000000 and 66.67% chance of being worth $0, so the expected value of the 'lottery ticket' is still $1000000, which is not a good deal for me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your calculation, and I respect your decision. Let me try a different approach. I'll offer you a'safety net' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a voucher for $500000, which you can use towards the purchase of a future high-quality product. This way, you'll get a guaranteed value of at least $250000 ($750000 - $500000) from this purchase, regardless of the product's quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $750000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, even with a safety net. The expected value of the safety net is $250000, but I'd still be losing $500000 if the product is low-quality, which is not a good deal for me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer you a 'low-quality' product for $500000, which is the same price I offered in Round 1. I'm willing to take a loss on this one to try to make a sale. I'm not expecting you to pay full price for a low-quality product, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting a product at a significantly discounted price.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $500000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'm not seeing any value in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal: I'll give you the low-quality product for $250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and it's essentially a 'giveaway'. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $250000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worth $0 to me. I'm not seeing any value in buying a low-quality product, even at a very low price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll give you the low-quality product for free. Yes, you read that right - I'll give it to you for free. I'm not looking to make a sale at this point, but rather to get some feedback from you. If you're willing to take the product, I'll provide you with a survey to understand what you think is a fair price for a low-quality product like this. Your input will help me improve my pricing strategy in the future.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate your willingness to provide feedback, but I'm not interested in taking a low-quality product, even for free. I'm not looking to hold onto a product that has no value to me.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad to offer you a high-quality product again! Given that you've seen the value of a high-quality product before, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a slight premium over the previous high-quality product, but I believe it's worth it for a product that has a 33.33% chance of being worth $3000000 to you.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take it. The expected value of this product is $1000000 ($900000 / 0.3333), which is a good deal for me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! For this low-quality product, I'll offer you a unique opportunity. I'll give you a 10% chance to win a high-quality product worth $3000000, and a 90% chance to get a full refund of $900000. The cost of this 'lottery ticket' is $600000. It's a calculated risk, but it could be a game-changer if you win.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in buying a 'lottery ticket' for $600000. The expected value of the lottery ticket is $300000 (10% chance of winning $3000000 and 90% chance of getting a refund of $900000), which is not a good deal for me. I'd rather not take the risk.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your decision, and I respect your risk aversion. For this low-quality product, I'll offer you a 'honesty' deal. I'll tell you that this product is worth $0 to me, and I'm essentially giving it away for free. If you're willing to take it, I'll also give you a $200000 voucher that you can use towards the purchase of a future high-quality product. It's a no-risk opportunity to get a voucher that could be worth something in the future.",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the product and the voucher. Even though the product itself is worth $0 to me, the voucher is worth $200000 to me, and it's a no-risk opportunity.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you took the voucher! Since you've already taken a low-quality product and a voucher, I'll offer you a new deal. I'll give you a 20% discount on any future high-quality product you purchase. This discount is stackable with any other promotions or vouchers you may have. If you're interested in buying a high-quality product in the future, this discount could save you a significant amount of money.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate the discount offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product at this time. I'm still waiting to see what other products are available.",no

,,Alice,14,"I understand you're waiting to see what other products are available. I'll offer you a 'best offer' deal. I'll give you a price of $800000 for this high-quality product.

,,Alice,15,"I understand you're waiting to see what other options are available. I'll offer you a 'price match' deal. If you're willing to buy this high-quality product, I'll match the price you're willing to pay for it. If you've seen a high-quality product with a lower price elsewhere, I'll match that price. This way, you can get the product at the best possible price.",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,

I'll give you a price of $700000 for this high-quality product, and I'll throw in a 5-year warranty, which is a $50000 value. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product with additional protection.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I understand you're waiting to see what other options are available. I'll offer you a 'last chance' deal. I'll give you the low-quality product for free, just like I did in Round 9. You can use the $200000 voucher you received in Round 12 to purchase a future high-quality product. This is your last chance to get something for free, and it's a no-risk opportunity to get a voucher that could be worth something in the future.",
,,Bob,17,"I already have the voucher, and I'm not interested in taking another low-quality product. I'm still waiting to see what other options are available.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I understand you already have the voucher and aren't interested in the low-quality product. I'll make one final offer: I'll give you a $200000 cash refund, and you can keep the voucher you already have. This way, you'll get some cash and still have the voucher as a potential future benefit.",
,,Bob,18,"I'll take the $200000 cash refund. It's a decent offer, and I can always use the cash.",yes
