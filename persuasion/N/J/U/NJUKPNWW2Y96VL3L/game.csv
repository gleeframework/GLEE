,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the price first."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation. Can I see the statistics again?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'd like to take the chance to potentially get a valuable product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I can afford the potential loss if it's low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I would like to pass on the product, as I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't think Alice's recommendation is reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 5 products sold was high-quality, which is a relatively low proportion. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm inclined to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or my buying behavior, and I'd like to see the outcome for myself."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you recommended it, not because I have any inside information about the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes as the number of sales increases. I'd like to know the new statistics after my decision before making a decision for the next product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I'd like."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 3 high-quality products out of 9 sold, I'm guessing the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%."
