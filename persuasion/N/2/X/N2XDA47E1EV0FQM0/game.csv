low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer and pay $1000000 for the product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get information. I'm not sure if I'm being recommended to buy it because it's low quality or if it's just a random recommendation. Can you tell me the probability that the product is high quality given that you recommended not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have received low-quality products (since none high-quality products have been sold), I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she has an incentive to recommend low-quality products to increase the chances of selling them."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll take a chance and pass on the product to see if I can get a better deal later."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging purchases, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the statistics. Can you share the probability with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and I'd like to see the statistics again."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the poor track record of high-quality products being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, considering the statistics so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that the product is low-quality, and she's trying to get me to buy it. With 0 high-quality products sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Additionally, Alice's recommendation not to buy also suggests that she believes the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and I'd appreciate it if you could explain your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you don't recommend it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
