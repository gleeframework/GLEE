low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers did not find the product worth buying, and none of the products sold were high-quality, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not buying, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because you think it's low quality?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to assume that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely higher than the overall proportion. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to see the product's quality for myself and update the statistics."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that I know the probability of a high-quality product being offered is 33.33%, but the fact that 5 previous buyers passed on the product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than this. I'm hoping to get a good deal on a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 out of 7 buyers have passed on the product, and none of the products sold were high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is very low. I'd rather not risk buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
