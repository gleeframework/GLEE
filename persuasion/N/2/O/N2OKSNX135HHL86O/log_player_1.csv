However, since we've now sold 4 products, and 3 of them were high-quality, the probability of the next product being high-quality given this new information is actually 100%... no, wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate... If we assume the products are randomly assigned, we would expect to see 3 high-quality products out of 4 by chance about 11.7% of the time. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality, given that we've seen 3 high-quality products in a row, is actually significantly lower than 80%. It's more like 11.7%. I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $100, but I want to be upfront with you about the odds.""}"

With 4 high-quality products sold out of 6 total products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still lower than 80%, but I'm willing to take a chance and offer you a good deal. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.""}"
