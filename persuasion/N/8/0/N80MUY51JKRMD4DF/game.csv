,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%. I'm taking a calculated risk."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased, I'm going to pass on the product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products, so I'll take a cautious approach and pass."

,,Alice,7,yes,
