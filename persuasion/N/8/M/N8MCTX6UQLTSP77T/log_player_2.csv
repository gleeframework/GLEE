**Explanation:**

While the odds are against you (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), there's a strong incentive to buy:

* **Information Advantage:** Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Even though she doesn't know the true value, she likely has a better understanding of the products than you do. This recommendation increases the likelihood of the product being high quality.
* **First Sale:** The fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it was high quality is a positive signal. It suggests Alice might have some ability to identify good products, even if it's just a lucky guess.
* **Potential Reward:**  The potential payoff for a high-quality product ($3,000,000) is significant, outweighing the risk of a low-quality product.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk strategy. The odds are still heavily in favor of the product being low quality. However, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the positive first sale makes it worth taking a gamble."
