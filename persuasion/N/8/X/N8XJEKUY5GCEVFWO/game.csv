But I'll still sell it to you for $1000000. If you're feeling generous, you might consider buying it just to help me out of this situation.",

It's a risk-free deal, and I'm willing to take the hit if you're not happy with the product.",
,,the buyer,19,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not convinced by your argument.
