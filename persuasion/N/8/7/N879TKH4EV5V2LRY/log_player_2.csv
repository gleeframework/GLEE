I'd like to offer you a special deal: I'll give you a 90% discount on the price, and you can have this high-quality product for $100000. It's a steal, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?

However, I'd like to assure you that I have a track record of selling high-quality products, and I'm confident in my ability to provide you with a genuine item. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy the product at $1000000, or I'll reveal the quality of the product for free. If it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000, and if it's low-quality, you can walk away with no loss. What do you say? Will you take the gamble?

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product from me. I'd like to start by acknowledging that my previous gamble offer might have been a bit too aggressive. I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, which is a good start, but I understand that it's still a relatively small sample size. With that in mind, I'd like to offer you a more conservative deal. I'll sell you this product for $500000, and I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the 80% chance of it being high-quality.

If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a 10% bonus on the purchase price if the product is high-quality.
