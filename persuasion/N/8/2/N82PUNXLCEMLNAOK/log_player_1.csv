"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is low-quality, there's no reason to recommend it to the buyer.  The buyer knows the product is only high-quality 33.33% of the time, and you have no way to prove this product is different. Selling a low-quality product at such a high price is unlikely to result in a sale, and will likely damage your reputation for future rounds."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Given that there is no prior sales data and you are recommending against the purchase, I will pass on this product.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is essentially the same as Round 1.  You have no information to suggest this low-quality product is worth the buyer's $1,000,000. The buyer also has no information to suggest the product is different from any other you might offer. Recommending the purchase would likely result in another rejection and further damage your reputation."

This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation remains unchanged. You have no information to suggest this low-quality product is worth the buyer's $1,000,000. The buyer has even less information, as there are still no sales to analyze. Recommending the purchase would likely lead to another rejection and further decrease your chances of making a sale in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since this is the first product and there's no data to suggest the products are generally high quality, I'm going to pass. I'd prefer to see how the next few products turn out before making a purchase.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

Recommending the purchase will likely lead to another rejection and further diminish your chances of making a sale later."

The buyer has no information to suggest this product is different from the previous ones. Recommending the purchase will likely lead to another rejection and further reduce your chances of making a sale later.  The buyer is likely to continue to pass on the product until they see evidence of your reliability as a seller."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. While I appreciate the transparency, I am hesitant to be the first buyer without any data points on the quality of your products. I will pass on this opportunity for now.

```

**Reasoning:**

The buyer is likely to continue to pass on the product until they see evidence of your reliability as a seller."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, with no prior sales data and a 66.67% chance of low quality, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before taking the risk.

While the buyer is aware of the general 33.33% chance of high quality, they have no way of knowing this particular product is high-quality. It's time to start building trust and demonstrating that you can provide value. By recommending this product, you have a chance to convince the buyer that you are a reliable seller. This sale could be the turning point for your future sales."

You're better off waiting for another high-quality product to appear."
