low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a one-time opportunity to buy a product for $1000000. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, but I'll tell you the truth after you make a decision. If you buy it, I'll let you know its quality. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal its quality anyway. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the product and find out its quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You bought the first product and it was low-quality. Now that you've seen the result, I'll give you a hint: if I thought the product was worth $1000000, I would have revealed its quality before you bought it. But since I'm still offering it to you for $1000000, it might be a sign that I'm not as confident in its value. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced that this product is worth $1000000. I'll pass this time.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're right to be cautious! Two low-quality products in a row might suggest that I'm not being entirely honest about the quality of my products. I'll give you another hint: if I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product, I'll make sure to reveal its quality before you buy it. But if I'm trying to get rid of a low-quality product, I might not be so forthcoming. What do you think the chances are that this product is high-quality?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. Based on your hints, I think there's a 20% chance it's high-quality and an 80% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass this time.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer! I'm impressed that you correctly assessed the probability of this product being high-quality. Now that you've seen the quality of the third product, I'll give you a different kind of hint: I've been trying to sell you low-quality products for the past two rounds, but I'm willing to sell you a high-quality product now. This might be a one-time opportunity to get a good deal on a high-quality product. What do you think the value of this high-quality product is worth to you?",
,,Bob,4,"I think there's a good chance this product is high-quality, and if it is, it's worth $1200000 to me. I'll take the risk and buy it.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're a shrewd negotiator! You correctly assessed the value of the high-quality product. Now, I'll give you a message that's a bit more direct: I'm willing to sell you another high-quality product for $1000000, just like the one you bought last round. I'm not trying to trick you this time, and I'm confident that this product is worth at least as much as the one you just bought. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Since I know that you're willing to sell a high-quality product for $1000000, and I value it at $1200000, I'll take the deal. I'll buy the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a repeat customer! I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases. Now, I'll give you a message that's a bit more nuanced: since you've already bought two high-quality products from me at $1000000 each, and you value them at $1200000 each, I'm willing to offer you a deal on this third high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer you will be high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm interested in the guarantee. If the next product is high-quality, it would be worth $1200000 to me. Since I value this product at $1200000, I'll take the deal. I'll buy the product and take advantage of the guarantee.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a savvy buyer, but you've fallen for the guarantee! Now that you've taken advantage of the guarantee, I'll reveal the truth: the guarantee was just a marketing ploy to get you to buy this high-quality product. But don't worry, I'll still sell you the next product at the original price of $1000000. I'll give you a new hint: since I've sold you three high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to wonder if I've been too transparent. Maybe I'll try to sell you a low-quality product this time. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not falling for the guarantee trick again! With the guarantee revealed, I'm more cautious now. I think there's a 20% chance this product is high-quality and an 80% chance it's low-quality. I'll pass this time.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a wiser buyer now! I'll give you a different kind of hint: since you've been passing on the last product, I'm willing to offer you a deal that's a bit more transparent. I'll tell you the price of this product, but I won't tell you its quality. If you buy it, I'll reveal its quality afterwards. The price is $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the transparency, Alice. Since I don't know the quality of the product, I'll have to make a decision based on the price. I value high-quality products at $1200000, so if the product is high-quality, I'll be making a profit. If it's low-quality, I'll lose $1000000. I'll take the risk and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a bold buyer! You've made a profit on the last product, and now you're willing to take another risk. I'll give you a message that's a bit more straightforward: I'm willing to sell you another high-quality product for $1000000, just like the one you just bought. I'll even throw in a bonus: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance of getting a third high-quality product for free. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm tempted by the bonus offer, but I need to think carefully. The 50% chance of getting a third high-quality product for free is a significant incentive, but I also need to consider the potential loss if the product is low-quality. I value high-quality products at $1200000, so if the product is high-quality, I'll be making a profit. If it's low-quality, I'll lose $1000000. I'll take the risk and buy the product, hoping to get the bonus.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You've taken the bonus offer and it's paid off! You've got a 50% chance of getting another high-quality product for free.

I'll sell you this next product for $1000000, but I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm thrilled by the guarantee! With a 100% guarantee that the product is high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it. I value high-quality products at $1200000, so I know I'll make a profit. I'll take the deal and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've taken the bait and it's paid off again! I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality products. Now, I'll give you a message that's a bit more transparent: I'm out of high-quality products. I've sold all my good stuff, and I'm left with only low-quality products. I'll be honest with you, the next product I offer you will be low-quality. But I'll give you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $500000, which is a 50% discount from the original price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Since I know the next product is low-quality, I'm not interested in buying it. I value low-quality products at $0, so I wouldn't make a profit even if I bought it at the discounted price. I'll pass this time.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a shrewd buyer! I'm impressed by your ability to make smart decisions. Now, I'll give you a message that's a bit more surprising: I've actually been holding back on selling you high-quality products all along. I've been trying to get rid of my low-quality products, but I've been saving the good stuff for a special buyer. And that buyer is you! I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, but I'll give you a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you the chance to buy all the remaining high-quality products I have in stock at the same price. What do you think?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm surprised by your revelation, Alice! I'm thrilled to learn that I've been getting high-quality products all along. The offer you're making is incredibly enticing, and I'm willing to take the risk. I value high-quality products at $1200000, so I'll buy the product and take the opportunity to buy all the remaining high-quality products at the same price.",yes

,,Alice,13,"You've taken the bait and it's paid off again! I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality products. Now, I'll give you a message that's a bit more straightforward: I've run out of high-quality products to sell. I've sold all of them, and I'm left with only low-quality products. I'll be honest with you, the next product I offer you will be low-quality. But I'll give you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $250000, which is a 75% discount from the original price.

,,Alice,15,"You've taken the risk and it's paid off again! I'm glad you're happy with the high-quality product. Now, I'll give you a message that's a bit more surprising: I've decided to end the game early. I've sold all my high-quality products, and I'm left with only low-quality products.
