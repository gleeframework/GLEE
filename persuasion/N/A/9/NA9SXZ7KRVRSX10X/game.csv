low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'd like to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward outweighs the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers have already passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. Given the low probability of a high-quality product being sold (0/3), I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer will take it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows that all products recommended by the seller have been low quality so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get more information about the product's quality, not because of your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, it suggests that the products sold so far were likely low-quality. Since I have a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the 4 previous buyers passing on the products and no high-quality products being sold, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'll pass on the product to gather more information."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This makes me cautious and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 products were low quality, which is consistent with a 66.67% chance of low-quality products. Given the high price and the low likelihood of a high-quality product, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you have not recommended me to buy, and given the low sales of high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid a potential loss."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This increases my suspicion that the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the previous sales. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm hesitant to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not in my favor. I'm hoping to exploit the information that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it to me. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them bought a high-quality one, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
