Alice's message: Hello! I have a product available for $100. It could be a great value, but I can't guarantee its quality. I've sold eleven products so far, and three of them were high-quality. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","It seems like there is some confusion. Alice's message says she has sold eleven products, but the statistics say 10 buyers have purchased products. Let's assume the statistics are correct.

Given that 5 out of 10 products sold were high-quality, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50% as per the initial condition, not necessarily influenced by Alice's sales record since each product has an independent 50% chance of being high-quality.

Considering the expected value: 0.5 * $120 (high-quality) + 0.5 * $0 (low-quality) = $60. Since the selling price is $100, which is higher than the expected value of $60, it is not in the buyer's best interest to purchase the product.
