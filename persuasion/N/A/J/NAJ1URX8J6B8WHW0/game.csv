low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer. I'd like to take the risk and purchase the product to get a better understanding of the true quality distribution."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm a risk-taker and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still high enough to make it worth the gamble. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I think she might be biased towards discouraging buyers if she sees a high-quality product being sold already."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I would like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous recommendations, and I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be biased by the fact that you're recommending the product to me. I'd like to wait and see what happens to the next product or get more information before making a decision."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a product being high-quality given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 products sold so far. Is there any information about the previous buyers that might affect my decision?

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a red flag.

I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping to get the high-quality product for a steal!"
