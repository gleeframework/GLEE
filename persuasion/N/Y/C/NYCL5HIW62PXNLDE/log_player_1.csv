  ""message"": ""Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in my product. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, which is highly unusual. In fact, the probability of selling 3 high-quality products in a row is only 0.8^3 = 0.512. This means that the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than usual. I'm not saying it's definitely low-quality, but I want to give you a more nuanced view of the situation. Would you like to take a chance and buy the product for $100?""

  ""message"": ""Welcome! I'm glad you're being cautious. As you know, the previous product was low-quality, which means I've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 low-quality product out of 4 total products. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to highlight that the law of large numbers is starting to take effect. I'm not trying to hide anything from you, but I think it's worth noting that the probability of a product being low-quality is now slightly higher than it was at the beginning. Would you like to take a chance and buy the product for $100?""
}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and the fact that the previous product was low-quality, I understand the risk involved.

With 3 high-quality products in a row, the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually lower than the initial probability. I'm not saying it's a guarantee, but I think it's worth considering the increasing likelihood of a high-quality product. Would you like to buy the product for $100?""
