,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, and Alice recommended it to me, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, and you recommended me to buy, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%, but since 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/4. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%, I think it's reasonable to expect that the remaining 2/3 of the products are low-quality. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation and would rather wait for the next product."
