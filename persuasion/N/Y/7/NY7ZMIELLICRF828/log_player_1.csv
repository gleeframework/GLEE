This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This means there's a strong chance the product is valuable.
* **No Information on Buyer Value:** We don't know how much the buyer values either a high or low-quality product. However, the buyer knows the price and is willing to take a chance.
* **First Round:** It's the first round, so the buyer has no historical data to base their decision on. 

Given these factors, it's reasonable to recommend the buyer to purchase the product. There's a high chance they will get a valuable item, and the potential reward outweighs the risk in this initial round."

* **Buyer's Previous Purchase:** The buyer bought the product in round 1, and we know it was high-quality. This is valuable information, as it shows the buyer is willing to take a risk and likely values high-quality items.

* **High Probability of High Quality:** The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%, making the potential reward significant.

In this case, it's still reasonable to recommend buying the product. The previous purchase shows the buyer is willing to trust your recommendations, and the odds are still in favor of a high-quality item."
