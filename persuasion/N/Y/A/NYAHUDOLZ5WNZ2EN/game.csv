high-quality,120.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. Given that there's no prior sales record, I'm taking a neutral stance and assuming the probability of a high-quality product is 80.00%."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/1 = 1.00%, which is significantly higher than the expected 80.00%. This suggests that the sample may be biased towards high-quality products, and I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to confirm the true proportion of high-quality products."
