"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-Quality Product:** You know the product is high-quality, which is a good selling point.
* **Buyer's Lack of Information:** The buyer doesn't know the quality of the product. However, they do know the overall probability of a high-quality product (80%). 
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000, which is high but not an unrealistic price for a potentially valuable, high-quality product.
* **No Previous Data:** Since this is the first round, the buyer has no data on your past sales. 

**Recommendation:** Based on the information available, recommending the buyer to purchase is the best strategy. The buyer will likely be willing to take a chance on a potentially valuable product, especially with the high probability of it being high-quality."

* **Previous Positive Experience:** The buyer's positive message suggests they are likely to be more trusting of you, even with limited information about your sales history.

**Recommendation:**  Given the high-quality product and the buyer's positive experience, recommending the purchase is still a good strategy. The buyer is now more likely to believe you will continue selling high-quality products, even with a small sample size."
