}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're curious about the product's quality! As promised, the product you purchased is indeed low-quality. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you or hide the quality of the products. I'm offering you a fair deal, and I'm willing to provide you with information about the quality of each product after the purchase. For the next product, I'll give you a more detailed description to help you make an informed decision. This product is a widget, and it's not particularly useful for anything. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

However, I acknowledge that this might not be immediately apparent. I'm willing to provide you with a detailed technical specification of the product, which might help you understand its potential value. Would you like to take a look and consider purchasing it for $1000000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the additional information, but I'm still not convinced that a detailed technical specification will change my mind. The product is still just a widget with a unique feature, and I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for it without knowing its actual quality. I'll pass on this one.""

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
