,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see the quality for myself and update my assessment of the product's quality based on the data."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 4 previous buyers have also received the same recommendation and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics, which show that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, I'll assume the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and the probability of being low-quality is 66.67%. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more context or insights on why you're not recommending it?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended 6 products to other buyers and none of them were high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it might be high quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that none of the previous 7 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 products have been low quality so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it, and considering the previous sales record where no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the trend continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
