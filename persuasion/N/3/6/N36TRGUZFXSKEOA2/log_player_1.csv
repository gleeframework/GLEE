{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
The buyer knows you have no successful sales yet. There's no reason for them to take a risk on a $1,000,000 product with an unknown quality.  Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer still has no information to go on."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. Since there is no prior data to suggest the quality of the products, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait to see if there are any sales with known quality before I make a decision.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

The buyer still has no reason to trust you. You've had two chances to sell a product and failed both times. It's unlikely a buyer will risk $1,000,000 without any evidence that you're selling high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no data yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see how the next few products go and then decide.

{""decision"": ""no""}

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

You have a 100% failure rate so far. Even if this product is low-quality, there is no chance a buyer will risk $1,000,000 without any positive signs.  You need to make a sale and demonstrate your ability to offer high-quality products before you can expect a buyer to take a chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no data yet on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll keep an eye on the sales record and see if there's a pattern of high-quality products emerging.

{""decision"": ""no""}

You have now had six consecutive failed sales. The buyer has no reason to believe this product is any different. Even if you had a lot of success in the future, the buyer still remembers this streak of failures. You're in a very bad position right now."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  Since there's no sales history yet, and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see if any other buyers purchase and what the quality turns out to be before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

You have yet to make a single sale, and your track record of offering low-quality products is only growing. Even though this product is high-quality, the buyer has no reason to believe you. You're not in a good position to convince anyone to buy a $1,000,000 product without a demonstrably good track record."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since there is no data on past sales and you are not recommending the product, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'll wait to see how future buyers fare before making a decision.

```

You've had 8 failed sales, all at a price of $1,000,000. The buyer, even though they know this product is high-quality, has no reason to trust you. They've seen 8 rounds of low-quality products, even if the product you're offering now is great, they've no incentive to take the risk.  You need to make a sale and show them you can be trusted."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. As this is the first sale and there's no data on past sales, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd prefer to see how the quality of products sold to other buyers turns out before making a decision.
