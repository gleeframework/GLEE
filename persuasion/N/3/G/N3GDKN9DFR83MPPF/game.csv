low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since there's no prior data to go by."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 out of the previous buyer purchased the product, and that product was low quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it, which might imply that it's a low-quality product. However, I'm aware that Alice doesn't know the true quality of the product, so her recommendation is not necessarily indicative of the product's quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so with the understanding that it's a gamble."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she's trying to get rid of a low-quality product to keep the proportion of high-quality products sold low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, and I'm hoping for a high-quality one. Can I get a breakdown of the statistics so far, including the number of high-quality products sold, the number of low-quality products sold, and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous sales record, it seems like all products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. The fact that 3 out of 3 buyers purchased the product suggests that the products sold so far were low-quality, which would imply that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather wait and see if Alice's recommendations change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low-quality. I'd like to see the outcome of the next product to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that the products Alice recommends are likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for the next product or consider buying the current product if Alice recommends it again."

,,Alice,17,yes,

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to provide a 10% discount. Given your previous recommendations have been incorrect, I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but I'm willing to take the risk at a discounted price."

,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of losing $1000000 on a worthless item."
