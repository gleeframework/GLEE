,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, I'm hesitant to take the risk. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm going to take a risk and buy the product. I think the previous buyers may have been overly cautious, and the product might be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, and given the low success rate of previous buyers, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I'd like to know why Alice didn't recommend it and if there's any additional information she can provide before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%, I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $10000, which is a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $10000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? I'd like to make my own decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on the product. If all previous products were low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality would be 33.33%. I'd rather take the risk of potentially missing out on a high-quality product than risk buying a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not buying, based on the fact that you don't recommend it and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely low, and it's a good idea to be cautious."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales data."

,,Alice,16,no,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 33.33%. This makes me more cautious about buying the product. I'd like to wait for more information or pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality. With a 66.67% chance of being low quality, it's not worth the risk for me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 7 out of 7 products were low-quality, which is a very strong indication that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a product that is likely to be worth $0 to me."
