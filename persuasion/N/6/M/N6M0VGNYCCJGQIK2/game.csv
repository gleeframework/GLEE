It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to offer it at this price. What do you say? Will you take a chance on it?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the extra bonus, but I'm still not convinced. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is a better deal. Besides, I'm not sure if the product is even worth the $100, let alone the $170 you're implying it's worth.",no
