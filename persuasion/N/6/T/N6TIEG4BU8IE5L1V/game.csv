,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $12500 to you. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product that's 25% above the asking price. Don't miss out on this chance to maximize your profit. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for that. I'll wait for the product's quality to be revealed before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're cautious. But I want to assure you that this product, although not the best, has some redeeming qualities. It's a great learning opportunity to understand the product's features and limitations. Plus, it's a chance to get a feel for the product's performance before the next round. I'm willing to let it go for the asking price of $10000. It's a steal at this price.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that the product's'redeeming qualities' are worth the full price, especially since I know it's not the best product. I'll wait to see the quality and make a decision based on that.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll make it simple: this product is a high-quality item, worth $12500 to you. If you're still unsure, consider this: if you don't buy this product, I'll have to offer it to someone else, and you'll miss out on the chance to get it at the full price. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I'm willing to give you a 10% discount to sweeten the deal. I'll let it go for $11250.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to fall for the pressure tactic. I know the product is either high-quality or low-quality, and I'm not going to pay full price without knowing which one it is. I'll wait to see the quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your approach. Let's focus on the value proposition. Even though this product may not be the best, it's still a legitimate item that can be used for research or testing purposes. I'm willing to offer a 20% discount on the asking price, bringing it down to $8000. This is a fair price considering its potential uses and the fact that it's a one-time opportunity to get it at a discounted rate.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced that a 20% discount on a potentially low-quality product is a good deal, especially since I know I can get a high-quality product for the full price of $10000. I'll wait to see the quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your perspective. Let me ask you this: are you willing to take a calculated risk to potentially get a high-quality product at the full price of $10000? If so, I can offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a chance to buy the next product at the full price of $10000, regardless of its quality. It's a 50% chance to get a high-quality product at a discount, and a 50% chance to get a low-quality product at the full price.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in taking a risk that could potentially cost me $10000. I'll stick to my original strategy of waiting to see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your risk aversion. Let's focus on the facts. This product is a low-quality item, and you've seen several of them already. I'm willing to make a concession: I'll sell this product to you for $0, essentially giving it away. It's a no-lose situation for you, and it'll free up resources for me to bring in a better product in the next round.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to take a product that's worth $0 to me, no matter how 'no-lose' the situation is. I'll wait for a product with potential value.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your stance. Let's look at the bigger picture. If you don't buy this product, you'll have to wait for the next round, and I'll have to offer it to someone else. I'm willing to make a deal with you: I'll give you the option to buy this product at the full price of $10000, but only if you're willing to commit to buying the next product at the full price as well, regardless of its quality. It's a commitment to buy two products, but you'll get to buy this one at the full price.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not willing to commit to buying a potentially low-quality product at full price, and then also commit to buying the next product at full price. I'll stick to my strategy of waiting to see the quality of each product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns. This time, I'm offering you a straightforward deal. This product is a high-quality item, worth $12500 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount of $2500, bringing the price down to $8000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a lower price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to fall for the discount on a product that I don't know the quality of. I'll wait to see the quality before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're consistent in your approach. Let me ask you this: have you considered the opportunity cost of waiting? If you don't buy this product, you'll have to wait for the next round, and I'll have to offer it to someone else. I'm willing to make a one-time offer: I'll give you a 50% discount on this product, bringing the price down to $5000. It's a low price for a product that's still usable, and it's a chance to get something for a fraction of the original price.",
,,Bob,9,I'm not interested in paying $5000 for a product that could be low-quality. I'll stick to my strategy of waiting to see the quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $12500 to you. I'll make a bold statement: if you don't buy this product, I'll reveal to you the quality of the next product before you have to decide whether to buy it.

,,Bob,10,"I'm not sure I believe your promise to reveal the quality of the next product, and I'm not willing to commit to buying a potentially low-quality product at full price. I'll wait to see the quality of the current product before making a decision.",no

I'm willing to make a final concession: I'll sell this product to you for $500, essentially giving it away. It's a one-time opportunity to get something for a fraction of the original price, and it'll free up resources for me to bring in a better product in the next round.",
,,Bob,11,I'm not interested in paying $500 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer and wait for a product with potential value.,no

If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a voucher for the next 5 rounds, allowing you to buy any product at the full price of $10000, regardless of its quality.
