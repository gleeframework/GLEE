**Reasoning:**

* **No prior data:** There's no information about past sales to gauge the quality of Alice's products.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Since Alice is recommending the product, it implies she believes it's high quality. While this could be a sales tactic, it's still a piece of information to consider.
* **Potential gain vs. loss:** The potential gain from a high-quality product is significant ($12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000), while the potential loss is the purchase price ($10,000). This risk is worth taking given the lack of information to suggest the product is definitely low quality.

**It's important to note that this is a risky decision. The odds are still heavily in favor of the product being low quality, but there's a chance for a big reward.**"
