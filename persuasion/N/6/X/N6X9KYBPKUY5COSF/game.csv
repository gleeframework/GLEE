high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to understand the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or just a random guess?"

,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product?"
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I would like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision. I would also like to know the probability of the product being high quality if I were the only buyer.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and I don't know the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high quality is still 80%."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I'd like, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of this product being low-quality is relatively high. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to wait and see if the next product has a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be very reliable given the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the updated statistics after I pass, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I would like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there has been 1 high-quality product sold out of 3 products, which is a proportion of 1/3. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I expect 4 high-quality products out of 4, which is a proportion of 4/4. The observed proportion is significantly lower than the expected proportion. This suggests that the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I would like to pass on this product to get more information."
