"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 80% chance of being high quality and a 20% chance of being low quality, and it's worth $1,250,000 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.8 * $1,250,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $1,000,000

This is equal to the price of the product, so it's a neutral bet.  Since Alice is recommending it, there's a slight chance she has some information that makes it slightly more likely to be high quality.  Therefore, it's worth taking the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. However, I'm going to pass on this one.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice not recommending the product is a significant piece of information. Since Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality (she doesn't know it), it suggests she has information that makes this product more likely to be low quality.  Given that the expected value of buying a random product is positive, passing on this product is the safer option."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice!  I'll take a chance on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's recommendation was wrong in the previous round, it's important to remember her recommendations are not based on the actual quality of the product. Her recommendations are likely based on some other information she has. Since she's recommending this product, it's likely she has some information that suggests this product is more likely to be high quality. It's still a risky decision, but the expected value of buying the product is still positive."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  However, I'm going to pass on this one. Your track record with recommendations has been a bit mixed, so I'm going to err on the side of caution.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has given us mixed recommendations so far.  Even though her recommendation is not directly tied to the quality of the product, it still provides valuable information. Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely she has information that suggests this product is more likely to be low quality.  While the expected value of buying a random product is positive, the risk is too high given her recent track record. It's safer to pass on this one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm willing to take another chance on this one. Let's see what we get!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's track record is inconsistent, her recommendation carries some weight. Even though she's been wrong a few times, she's still providing information based on something. The expected value of buying a random product is positive, and since she's recommending this one, it suggests there's a higher likelihood of it being high quality. It's a gamble, but given the potential reward, it's worth taking the risk again."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  I appreciate your input, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your recommendations have been a bit unpredictable, and I'd rather not take the risk right now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been inconsistent, making her advice less reliable. While the expected value of buying a random product is positive, passing on this product is a safer bet. Since she's not recommending it, there's a higher chance it's low quality, and the potential loss outweighs the potential gain in this case."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been unpredictable, making it difficult to rely on her judgment.  While the expected value of buying a random product is positive, the risk is too high given her inconsistent track record.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's safer to pass and avoid the potential loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**
