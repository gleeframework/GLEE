**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal. 
* **Limited information:** We have very limited information: only one previous buyer bought a high-quality product. This is not enough to form a strong opinion about the overall quality of Alice's products.
* **Risk/Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($400) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($100) if the product is low-quality. 
* **The odds:**  Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is still positive (80% chance of $400 = $320, minus the $100 cost = $220 expected profit).

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking based on the information available.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products. This strongly suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, further reinforcing the likelihood of it being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a $400 high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting nothing."
