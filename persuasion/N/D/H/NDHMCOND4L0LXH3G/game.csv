,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the outcome of my decision, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product and test it out, as there's no prior data to go by and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision, especially since none of the previous products have been high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as there have been no high-quality products sold so far, and the probability of this product being low-quality is 20%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you didn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product so I can prove that your recommendation system is flawed."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers who bought products were likely misled by Alice's recommendations, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, so I'm hesitant to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the previous products were low-quality. Therefore, I will pass on the current product to see if Alice's recommendation is still positive."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of previous sales of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers, who had access to the same information, also bought the product despite the 0 high-quality products sold. This suggests that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the low sales of high-quality products so far. I'd like to pass on this one.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but can I ask, what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the probability of it being low quality is higher than the probability of it being high quality, given Alice's previous recommendations."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there a reason you think it's low-quality?
