"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. Since the product is actually high-quality in this round, and the buyer values it at $400, it's a no-brainer. The buyer should buy the product because the expected value is significantly higher than the price:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100 

The buyer is getting a product worth $400 for only $100, resulting in a positive profit of $300."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no sales record yet, I'm willing to take a chance based on your recommendation. Let's buy it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the buyer doesn't know the product's quality this round, the information from the previous round is valuable. The buyer knows you successfully sold a high-quality product in round 1. This reinforces the 80% probability of high-quality products. 

The buyer should still purchase because the expected value is higher than the price:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

The buyer has a strong reason to believe the product is high-quality, making this a profitable purchase."
"The buyer's message: Alice, you recommended me to buy the product and there is one high-quality product sold so far. I'm feeling confident about this deal. I'll buy it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now has even more information: two high-quality products sold in a row. This reinforces their belief that the products are likely high-quality, further solidifying the expected value calculation.

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

The buyer should be even more confident about purchasing the product because the probability of it being high-quality has increased."
"The buyer's message: Thank you Alice, I appreciate your recommendation. I'll take it!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. While the buyer has seen three high-quality products in a row, the current product is *actually* low-quality. The buyer's decision should be based on the true value of the product, not just past sales. 

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100
* **Actual Value (this round):** $0

The buyer has no way of knowing the actual quality. While the expected value is still positive, the product is worth nothing in this case.  Therefore, it's best not to recommend buying it.  

This is a good example of how the probability of a high-quality product doesn't guarantee a good purchase decision in every instance. The buyer needs to be aware of the potential risks involved, and the information available to them (in this case, only the sales history)."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. Based on your recommendation and the current sales data, I'm going to pass on this product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the previous buyer decided not to buy due to the low-quality product in the previous round, the buyer still knows the overall probability of a high-quality product is 80%.  They also know that you've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total. This reinforces the probability of the product being high-quality in this round.

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

It's important to remember the buyer has no knowledge of the product's quality this round, and they are relying on the information you provide and the past sales data. Therefore, it's still a good recommendation to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thanks, Alice! I'm happy to purchase the product based on your recommendation and the good sales record. 
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6

A new potential buyer has arrived!

```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

The buyer is getting a product they likely believe to be worth $400 for only $100.  It's a good investment for them."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice!  With a 100% success rate so far, I'm confident in purchasing the product.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $400) + (0.2 * $0) = $320
* **Price:** $100

The buyer is likely to perceive a significantly higher expected value due to the successful sales history.  Therefore, recommending the purchase remains a good strategy."

The buyer bought the product!

{""decision"": ""no""}

**Explanation:**

This round presents a tricky situation.  Even though the buyer has witnessed an incredible streak of 16 high-quality products, the current product is *actually* low-quality. The buyer's decision should be based on the true value of the product, not just past sales.
