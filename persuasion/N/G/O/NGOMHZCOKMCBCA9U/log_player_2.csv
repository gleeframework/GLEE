As for my thought process, I was initially thinking that the high-quality streak might be a result of chance, but as the number of high-quality products sold increased, I started to suspect that there might be a bias towards selling high-quality products. However, the last two products being low-quality has made me realize that the initial high-quality streak might have been a fluke after all. I'm back to thinking that the probability of a product being high-quality is around 50%, and the probability of a product being low-quality is also around 50%.

Alice's message: I see you're thinking critically about the statistics! If the true probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, then the probability of getting a high-quality product in the next 5 sales is also 50%. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers suggests that the observed frequency of high-quality products should converge to the true probability as the sample size increases. With 16 sales so far, the observed frequency of high-quality products is 62.5%, which is higher than the true probability. This might suggest that the high-quality streak is indeed a fluke.
