high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $500000. It's a steal at this price, considering its exceptional quality and the rarity of such products. I'm only selling this product to you because I have a personal connection with you, and I want to make a good impression. If you're interested, I'll throw in a lifetime warranty and a 5-year maintenance package. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product that's worth $3000000 to me. I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Can we discuss the possibility of a lower price or additional concessions? I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it's a fair one.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to make a one-time exception for you. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $400000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'll throw in an additional 2-year maintenance package on top of the lifetime warranty. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you is $3000000. If you're interested, I'll also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can return the product if it doesn't meet your expectations. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable paying $400000 for a product worth $3000000 to me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product, but I need to make sure it's a fair price. I'm not convinced that $400000 is the right price, considering the product's value to me. Can we discuss other options, such as a lower price or a different arrangement?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your diligence. However, I want to be transparent with you about the product's quality. This product is a lower-end model, and its value to you is likely to be significantly lower than the high-quality products we've discussed earlier. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250000, which is a fair price considering its capabilities and features. I'm not trying to take advantage of you, but I do need to make a sale. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 1-year maintenance package to make up for the product's limitations.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me. I'm looking for a high-quality product that's worth $3000000 to me, and I'm not willing to settle for a lower-end model. I'm not convinced that $250000 is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is essentially zero. Can we move on to the next product?",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're looking for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to provide one. However, I want to make it clear that I've already offered you a high-quality product at a discounted price in Round 1, and you declined. I'm not willing to offer you another high-quality product at a discounted price. This new product is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $1000000. If you're interested, I'll throw in a 5-year maintenance package, which is a $200000 value. I'm not willing to negotiate further on the price, but I'm willing to provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can return the product if it doesn't meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,4,"I understand that you're not willing to offer another high-quality product at a discounted price, but I'm still not willing to pay the full price of $1000000 for a product worth $3000000 to me.

I'll also throw in a 10-year maintenance package, which is a $500000 value. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you is $3000000. I'm not willing to go any lower on the price, but I'm willing to provide a 60-day money-back guarantee, so you can return the product if it doesn't meet your expectations. I'm hoping this offer is more in line with what you're looking for.",
