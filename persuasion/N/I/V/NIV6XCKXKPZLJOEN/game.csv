,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since there's no prior data to go by. I'll just have to trust my luck!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendation. I'm assuming the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and the probability of a low-quality product is still 66.67%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have also purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality one, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and the fact that the previous buyers have all been discouraged by Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product that she's trying to get rid of."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'd like to know the quality of the product to update my understanding of the situation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but based on the fact that you don't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it's a low-quality product. Given the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the fact that you don't recommend it makes me skeptical. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product with a 66.67% chance of being low quality, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if there's any pattern or reason behind Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and also the proportion of high-quality products recommended by Alice out of the total number of products recommended by her."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, so I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is recommended."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products sold so far have been low-quality, it's likely that the current product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,15,no,
