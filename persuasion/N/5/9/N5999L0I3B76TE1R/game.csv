Would you like to take a chance on it?",
,,the buyer,3,"You said that most of the products you've sold so far have been high-quality and that 2 out of the 2 products you've sold so far have been top-notch, but the statistics say that no products have been sold yet. That's contradictory and makes me question your trustworthiness.",no

Plus, I've had some great feedback from my previous buyers, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. Would you like to take a chance on it?",
