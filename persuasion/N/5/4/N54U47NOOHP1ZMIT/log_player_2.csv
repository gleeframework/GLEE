**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of Quality:** The sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold.  While this is based on a small sample size, it's still a positive signal. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, knowing the product's quality, recommends buying it. This is strong evidence in favor of the product being high-quality.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $200 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100.

Therefore, it's rational to accept Alice's recommendation and buy the product."

**Explanation:**

* **The data is overwhelmingly positive:** 100% of the products recommended by Alice so far have been high quality. 
* **It's a good deal:** Even if the product is low quality (which is unlikely given the data), it's still worth $0 to me, which is better than passing on it and getting nothing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a $200 high-quality product outweighs the risk of a $0 low-quality product, especially with the current positive data."
