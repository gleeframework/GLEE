A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, my goal is to maximize sales. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and this product is confirmed high-quality, I should recommend the buyer to buy it. The buyer will likely be willing to pay $100 for a product they know has an 80% chance of being high-quality, especially since they don't know the specific value of a high-quality product."
