Alice's message: We've had one sale so far, and it was a low-quality product. The statistics are now 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the odds are now slightly against it. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000.

Alice's message: We've now had two sales, and the statistics are 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products sold. The probability of a product being high-quality is now 33.33% (which is the same as before, since the probability doesn't change with the number of sales). However, I'd like to highlight that we've just had a high-quality product in the last sale, which might suggest that the probability is actually higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a great deal on a potentially high-quality item.

Alice's message: We've now had two high-quality products out of 4 total products sold, which is a slightly higher proportion than the 33.33% probability. However, it's still early days, and we need more data to confirm this trend. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but I'd like to point out that we've had two consecutive low-quality products, which might suggest that the previous high-quality sale was just a fluke. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a great deal, but you should be aware of the recent trend.

Alice's message: We've now had two high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, and two low-quality products in a row. This might suggest that the previous high-quality sales were just a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but it's worth noting that we're starting to see a trend of low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000. It's a risk, but you might be able to get a high-quality product at a great price. Alternatively, you might be able to get a low-quality product at a very low price.

I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - the chances of it being high-quality are lower than they were before.
