,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and hope it's a high-quality one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm curious to see if Alice's recommendation is correct. I'm not relying on her recommendation to make my decision, but rather my own judgment based on the statistics. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm aware that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. I'm skeptical about the quality of the product, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but you know the product's value to me. If you've already recommended it to 3 other buyers and none of them bought it, that means all 3 products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with the low recommendation. I think the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take that chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see the recommendation for the next buyer."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the initial 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm concerned that Alice has not recommended the product, and given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, Alice. Is there something I should be concerned about?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not basing my decision on her recommendation, but rather the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'm hoping to get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and possibly get a high-quality product for $1000000, which would be a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer has a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, I believe the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is higher than the overall average. I'd like to see the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's recommendation is against buying it. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and get a better sense of the true quality distribution of the products."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of my valuation of the product, and I don't want to fall into a trap. I'll pass on this one."
