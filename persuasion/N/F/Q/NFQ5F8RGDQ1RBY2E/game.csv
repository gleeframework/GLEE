high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I have a high-quality product that I'm willing to sell to you for $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not going to fall for that. I know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but I also know that you know the value I place on it. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you decide whether to buy it. This way, you can get a sense of the overall quality of the products I have available, and make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not going to fall for the guarantee. I think you're trying to manipulate me into buying this high-quality product by offering a deal that gives me more information about the next product. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm not trying to manipulate you. I'm simply offering a genuine opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price. I'll give you a straightforward message: I've already offered you two high-quality products in a row, and I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll keep selling it to someone else.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced that you're being straightforward. Given the high probability of a high-quality product, it's still in your interest to get rid of the low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, but I'll also throw in a 'no-regret' clause: if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $2500 credit towards the purchase of the next product. This way, you can take a chance on this product and still have a safety net if it ends up being low-quality.",
,,Bob,4,I don't think the 'no-regret' clause changes the fact that you're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price of $10000. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. I know it's a risk, but I'm confident that you'll be able to see the value in it. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund, no questions asked. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you at this price because I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not buying it. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price of $10000, and I know that you know its value to me is $12500. I'm not going to take on the risk of buying it without getting a better deal.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $9500. I'm willing to take a small loss on the sale to incentivize you to buy it. I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not falling for it. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price that's only slightly lower than the original $10000. I think you're just trying to get rid of the low-quality product you had last round, and I'm not going to take the bait.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm going to be transparent with you. I've sold you two low-quality products in a row, and I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $9500. I'm not trying to get rid of anything, I'm just offering you a great deal on a high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to take a loss on the sale to prove to you that I'm not just trying to get rid of low-quality products.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not buying it. Your transparency is suspiciously convenient, and I'm not convinced that you're not just trying to get rid of the low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm going to give you a completely different offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500, but I'll also give you the option to buy it for $10000 and get a chance to buy the next product for $8000. This way, you can take advantage of a great deal on a high-quality product and potentially get an even better deal on the next one.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in your complicated offer. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price that's not significantly lower than the original $10000. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm willing to make a one-time exception to the price. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, and that's the lowest price I'm willing to offer. I'm not trying to make a profit on this sale, I just want to get rid of it and move on.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced that you're not trying to make a profit on this sale. You're still selling a high-quality product at a price that's 25% below the original price, but it's still a significant profit for you. I'll pass on this one.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm willing to sell you this high-quality product for $8000. I'm essentially giving it away at this price. I've already lost money on the previous two high-quality products, and I'm not going to make a profit on this one either. I just want to get it off my hands.",
,,Bob,10,"Alright, I'll take it. I'm not sure if you're telling the truth about losing money, but at this price, it's a risk worth taking. I'll buy the high-quality product for $8000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! As promised, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before you decide to buy it. And, I'll also give you a heads up that this next product is actually the last one I have available. If you buy it, you'll be getting the best deal of the entire sale.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not falling for the 'best deal of the entire sale' pitch. You've already sold me a high-quality product at a discounted price, and now you're trying to create a sense of urgency to sell the last product. I'll wait and see what the quality of the next product is before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your decision to wait. Let me be transparent with you: I've already sold you a high-quality product at a discounted price, and I'm willing to do the same for this one. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, the same price as the previous one. No tricks, no games, just a fair deal on a great product.",
,,Bob,12,"Alright, I'll take it. You're offering a fair deal, and I'm not going to pass up another chance at a high-quality product at a discounted price.",yes

,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! As you know, this is the last product I have available. I'll sell it to you for $7500, which is the lowest price I've offered on any high-quality product so far. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you want to complete the set, this is your chance.",
,,Bob,13,"I'll take it. You're offering a good price, and I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to complete the set. I'll buy the last product for $7500.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I need to inform you that I've already sold you three high-quality products in a row. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's likely that the next product will be low-quality. I'll sell it to you for $7000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteeing its quality. You're taking on the risk of getting a low-quality product at this price.",
,,Bob,14,"I'm not buying it. You're being upfront about the risk, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to take on the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a price that's still higher than what I'd be willing to pay for a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I completely understand your decision. I'll be honest with you, this is a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $0, just to get it off my hands. I'll even throw in a small token of appreciation for your understanding, which is a detailed report on the product's specifications and any potential issues you might encounter.",
,,Bob,15,"I'll take it. I'm not going to pass up a free product, and the report on its specifications and potential issues will be useful even if it's a low-quality product.",yes

I'll sell it to you for $6500, which is the lowest price I've ever offered on a high-quality product. I'm essentially giving it away at this price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at an unbeatable price.",
,,Bob,16,I'm not buying it. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price that's suspiciously low. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll pass on this one.,no

,,Alice,17,"I'm not trying to sell you anything. I'm just offering you a high-quality product at a fair price. I'll sell it to you for $6000, and that's it. No games, no tricks, just a straightforward sale. If you don't want it, I'll just give it to someone else.",
,,Bob,17,I'm not convinced. You're still trying to sell me a high-quality product at a price that's too low. I'm not going to take the risk of buying it from you.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not trying to sell you anything. I'm just going to tell you the truth. I've already sold you three high-quality products at discounted prices, and I've given you a low-quality product for free. I've lost money on every sale, and I'm not going to make a profit on this one either. I'll sell it to you for $6000, but I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it. If you don't want it, that's okay.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm not buying it. You're being honest, but I'm still not convinced that you're not trying to manipulate me. I'll pass on this one.",no

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Well, that's it for me. I've sold all my products, and I'm done. I want to thank you for being a tough negotiator and for pushing me to be honest about my products. I think we've had a fair and transparent transaction. This high-quality product is the last one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $5500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",
