,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to get the first data point and see if the product is high or low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests that the product might be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your previous recommendations. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyers all passed on the product, and I'm trying to exploit the information that there hasn't been a single high-quality product sold yet. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still quite low, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as it might influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were discouraged from buying, and none of them bought the product, I suspect that all 4 products were low-quality. If that's the case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 5 buyers have purchased the product so far and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the products being recommended are more likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice does not recommend the product. I'm inclined to pass on it, but I'm curious to see if Alice's recommendation is based on her understanding of my decision-making process or if it's just a random guess. I'd like to see how she reacts to my decision to pass."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the statistics and the odds of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, I'd like to know the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm only buying because I think the probability of a high-quality product is higher than the previous 7 buyers, who all passed on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold and your recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products sold so far were all low-quality. If that's the case, then the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is not high enough for me to take the risk of buying it for $1000000."
