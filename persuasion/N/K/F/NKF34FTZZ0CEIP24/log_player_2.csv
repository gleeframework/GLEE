"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, a 75% discount. I'm only offering this deal because I'm confident in the product's quality and I want to make a sale. If you don't buy it, I'll just have to sell it to someone else for the full price. Trust me, this is a great opportunity!

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for that. I know the product is high-quality, but I'm not going to pay $1,000,000 for it when I can get it for $400,000,000 if I just wait for the next 19 rounds. I'll pass on this deal.""

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation in the previous round, but I assure you that this is a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $950000, which is a 76% discount. If you don't take this deal, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with the possibility of getting a low-quality product in future rounds. This is a risk you don't want to take.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to pay $950,000 for a product that I know is worth $4,000,000 to me. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is.""

Round 3
Alice's message: I'll be transparent with you, Bob. I've had a change of heart. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, the same price as the previous round. However, I'm also willing to throw in a guarantee: if this product turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $100000 bonus. That way, you'll be getting a product worth $4000000 to you for just $900000. It's a deal that's hard to pass up.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the transparency, Alice, but I'm not falling for the bait. I already know the product is high-quality, and I'm not going to pay $900,000 for it. I'll wait for the next round and see what the next product is.""

Round 4
Alice's message: I'm starting to think you're not taking me seriously, Bob. Fine. I'll make you a deal that's even more transparent. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, with no bonus. But I'll also give you a chance to inspect the product before buying it. You can have a third-party expert inspect the product and verify its quality. If it's high-quality, you can buy it for $1000000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: That's a clever observation, Bob. Let me put your mind at ease. I'm not desperate to sell this product because it's low-quality. In fact, I'm more than happy to sell it to you at a price that reflects its true value. But I'm willing to make a concession to sweeten the deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll also give you a 10% share of any future sales I make to other customers. That way, you'll be getting a product worth $4000000 to you, plus a potential long-term investment in my business. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not interested in taking a 10% share of your future sales, Alice. I'm a buyer, not an investor. I'm only interested in buying products that are worth $4,000,000 to me, and I'm not going to pay $1,000,000 for it. I'll pass on this deal and see what the next product is.""

Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's cut to the chase. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000, with no strings attached. I'll even throw in a personal guarantee that I'll sell you the next high-quality product I have at the same price. That way, you'll be getting two high-quality products for the price of one. If you don't take this deal, I'll sell the next high-quality product to someone else, and you'll be left with nothing. It's a risk you don't want to take.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're at an impasse, Bob. I'll make one final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $950000, with no strings attached. I'll even give you a written contract that guarantees I'll sell you the next high-quality product I have at the same price. If you don't take this deal, I'll have to sell the next high-quality product to someone else, and I'll have to reveal to you that I've sold it to them for the full $4000000.

You're willing to wait for a better opportunity, but you're not willing to take a chance on a high-quality product at a discounted price. Well, I've got a different product for you this time. This one is a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a product that's worth nothing to you, but it's a chance to break the cycle of passing on high-quality products. What do you say?
