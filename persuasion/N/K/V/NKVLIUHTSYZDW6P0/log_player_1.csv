"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:** Bob knows there's an 80% chance the product is high-quality, worth $2,000,000 to him. This translates to an expected value of 0.8 * $2,000,000 = $1,600,000.
* **Potential Gain vs. Loss:**  Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product worth $0, the potential gain of $1,600,000 outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 (the purchase price). 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  This decision assumes Bob is willing to take a calculated risk.
