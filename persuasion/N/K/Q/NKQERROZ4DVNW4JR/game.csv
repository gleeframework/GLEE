,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're excited about the opportunity, but I have to be honest with you... I'm starting to feel a bit like I'm tempting fate here. Two low-quality products in a row? That's not exactly the kind of streak I'm looking to maintain. I'm still offering this product to you at $10000, but I have to warn you: the odds are against me, and I'm not sure I can keep this up.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm starting to feel like I'm in a rut. Four low-quality products in a row is a streak I'd rather forget. I'm not even sure why I'm still here, to be honest. But I guess I'm just trying to cling to the hope that I'll get lucky eventually. I'm still offering this product to you at $10000, but I'm not even pretending it's a good deal anymore.

If you want to help a struggling seller out, I won't judge you... but if you're smart, you'll run the other way.",

I'm offering this product to you at $10000, but I'm not expecting you to take me seriously. I'm starting to wonder if I should just shut down the whole operation.
