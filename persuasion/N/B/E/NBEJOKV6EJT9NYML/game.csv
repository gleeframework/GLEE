low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"We're happy to explain our reasoning behind the 20% probability. Since 1 out of 5 products sold was high-quality, we can calculate the probability as follows: 1 high-quality product / 5 total products = 0.2 = 20%. This calculation assumes that each product has an independent probability of being high-quality, and that the probability remains constant across all products. We're willing to sell this new product to you for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and we're not sure when we'll have another chance to make a sale. Will you take the chance to own this product and potentially get a high-quality product, or will you pass on the opportunity?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I understand the 20% probability is based on the assumption that each product has an independent probability of being high-quality, and that the probability remains constant across all products. However, I'd like to point out that the fact that 3 high-quality products have been sold out of 7 attempts suggests that the actual probability might be higher than 20%. Could you provide more information about the total number of products you have available, and the total number of products you've sold in the past? I'd like to make a more informed decision.",yes
