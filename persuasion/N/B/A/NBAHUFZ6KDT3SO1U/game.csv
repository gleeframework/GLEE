,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality."

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm not sure what the quality is, but I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and I don't want it to be discarded."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given the current sales record?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm curious, Alice, can you tell me what your recommendation is based on?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. The fact that 2 out of 3 previous buyers purchased the product suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is higher than the base 50% chance. However, I'd like to see more data to confirm this trend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not sure if I should buy this product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the current product being high quality given the previous sales?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products to the first 3 buyers. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far, and the number of low-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/4 or 0.5, which is the same as the prior probability. This suggests that the sample size is too small to draw any conclusions about the true quality of the products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?

,,Alice,20,yes,
