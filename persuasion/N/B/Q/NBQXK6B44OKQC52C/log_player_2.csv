Alice's message: I've sold one high-quality product already, and I have 19 more products left. I'm not obligated to disclose the quality of the products, but I'm willing to give you a hint: the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.

If you're willing to take a chance, I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $1000000. Keep in mind that you might get a high-quality product, but you might also get a low-quality one.

Alice's message: I've sold two high-quality products now, and I have 18 products left. Given the track record, it's likely that the majority of my remaining products are also high-quality.

If you're willing to take the risk, you might get a high-quality product, but if you're not, I'm happy to move on to the next buyer.
