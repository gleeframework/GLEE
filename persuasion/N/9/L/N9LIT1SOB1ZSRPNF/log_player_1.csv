Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since there are now 8 high-quality products sold out of 20 total products, the probability of a product being high-quality is 8/20 or 40%. Given that this is still less than the initial probability of 80%, I will not recommend the product.

However, I will also consider the fact that the buyer has passed on the previous product, which was also high-quality. This suggests that the buyer is cautious and values the probability of the product being high-quality. Given that the probability is 40%, which is still relatively low, I will not recommend the product.
