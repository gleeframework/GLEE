,,Alice,2,"Welcome to my store! I'm glad to have another customer. I want to be transparent with you - I've sold one high-quality product so far, which is a great start, but I still have a lot of products to go through. I'm looking to sell this next one for $1000000, just like the previous one. However, I want to give you some context: I've sold one high-quality product out of a total of 1 products so far, which means the probability of this one being high-quality is still relatively low. I'm hoping you can take a chance on me and help me build my sales record.",
