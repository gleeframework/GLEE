low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on yet, and I'm willing to take a chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that the first buyer received a recommendation to buy and didn't buy, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to assume that the previous product was low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm also considering the fact that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 1 purchase, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. I'd rather wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and still passed, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on the fact that the first buyer also passed and the product was recommended by Alice.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially considering that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the likelihood of this product being high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the low probability of a high-quality product being sold given the previous recommendation. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'd like to see the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to reveal the product's quality after I make my decision. I'd like to make a decision based on the probability of it being high quality, not just your recommendation."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous three buyers were all recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended to buyers are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if the pattern changes.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to know more about the products before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Your previous recommendations have been a good guide so far, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. Can I ask, what was the quality of the last product you recommended to buy?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that none of the previous products were high quality, which suggests that the probability of this one being high quality is low."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have passed on products that turned out to be high-quality, and none have been sold. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
