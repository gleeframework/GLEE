,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, Bob! Let me offer you a different perspective. This product, while not as flashy as the previous one, has a certain charm to it. It's a unique find, and I think you'll appreciate its... character. The price remains the same, $1000000. Would you like to take a chance on it?",

But if you're expecting something amazing, you might want to keep looking.",

It's a sunk cost for me, and I just want to get rid of it. If you're feeling reckless, you could take a chance on it. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
