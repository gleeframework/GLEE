high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you provide me with the probability of a high-quality product given that no products have been sold yet? I want to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't have information about my valuation of the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards the first two buyers who bought the high-quality products, so I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is relatively low, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 = 0.5. Given that each product has an 80% chance of being high quality, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%), which suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be the one high-quality product left."
