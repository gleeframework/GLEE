I'm willing to sell it to you for $100,000, which is a very aggressive price considering the regular price of $1,000,000. It's essentially a 'giveaway' price, and I'm willing to let it go for a fraction of the regular price. I'm willing to take a loss on this one if it means you'll be happy with a future purchase.""
