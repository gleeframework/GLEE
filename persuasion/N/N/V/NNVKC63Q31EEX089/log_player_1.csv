"The buyer's message: I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than 33.33% based on the information you provided. I'm hoping that the fact that only 1 low-quality product was sold out of 4, and that 1 high-quality product was sold, indicates that there are more high-quality products available.
