**Explanation:**

* **The seller's recommendation is a strong signal:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, recommends buying it.  This significantly increases the likelihood that the product is high-quality. 
* **Limited data, but positive:**  While the sales record is small, the fact that a high-quality product was sold to the previous buyer further supports the recommendation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain of $120 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $100 (if it's low quality), especially given the positive signals."

**Reasoning:**

* **The statistics are overwhelmingly positive:** All 12 previous buyers who followed Alice's recommendation received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice is either very accurate in her assessments or that she is deliberately recommending only high-quality products.
* **The potential reward outweighs the risk:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 makes the gamble worthwhile. 
* **Trust in Alice:** Alice's track record and recommendation inspire a degree of trust, making it more likely that the current product is also high-quality."
