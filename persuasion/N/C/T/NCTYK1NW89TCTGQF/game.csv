,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"

,,Alice,2,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this is a contrarian play based on the fact that she's seen no high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers were also recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests the products recommended so far may have been low-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the total number of products offered and the number of low-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the products are likely to be low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this because there have been no high-quality products sold yet, and I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak. I'm also considering the possibility that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, so I'm taking a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm not confident in the quality of this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. This might imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 5 buyers didn't find it valuable, but I'd like to take a chance and see if I'm one of the lucky ones."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you've recommended 6 products and none of them were high quality, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality sales, and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were recommended and none of them were high quality, I suspect that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
