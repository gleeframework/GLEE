Since you know the product is low-quality and Bob has no information about the specific product, it's not advisable to recommend him to buy it. There's no chance of Bob getting a good deal, and he's only risking losing a significant amount of money."

This is a tricky situation.  While Bob has no information about this specific product, we know it's high-quality.
