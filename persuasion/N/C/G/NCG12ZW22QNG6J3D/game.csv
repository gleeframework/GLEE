,,Alice,1,I have a high-quality product for sale for $10000. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. It's a rare opportunity to own a top-notch item. Would you like to purchase it?,
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure, I'd like to see more products before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your hesitation. I'll offer you another high-quality product, and I'll give you a unique opportunity to compare it to the one you saw earlier. This one is also a top-of-the-line item, and I'm willing to let you inspect it carefully before making a decision. Would you like to purchase this one instead?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to see more products before making a decision. I'm not convinced that the quality of this one is any different from the first one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. To be transparent, I'll let you know that this product is not as high-quality as the previous ones. However, it still has some value and might be a good option for someone on a budget. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, a significant discount from the usual price of $10000. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd like to see more high-quality options.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your preference for high-quality products. Let me ask you a question: are you willing to pay the full $10000 for a high-quality product, or do you need some assurance that it's worth that price? I'm happy to provide you with a detailed description of this product's features and benefits, and I can also offer a 30-day return policy, so you can try it out risk-free. Would you like to take a closer look?",
,,Bob,4,I'm still not convinced. I'd like to see more products and get a better sense of the overall selection before committing to a purchase.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your desire to see more options. Let me offer you a compromise: I'll show you a total of 5 products, and you can choose any one of them. This way, you'll get a better sense of the overall selection, and you can pick the one that best fits your needs. The catch is that you'll need to make a decision within the next 2 rounds, or the offer will expire. Would you like to take me up on this offer?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to see the 5 products before making a decision. I'll consider the offer after I see them.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'll show you the 5 products, but I'll give you a hint: the first 3 products I'll show you are all high-quality, and the last 2 are not. The first product I'll show you now is this high-quality one. It's a top-of-the-line model with advanced features and excellent performance. Would you like to consider this one as one of your 5 options?",
,,Bob,6,I'll consider this one as one of my 5 options. I'd like to see the next 4 products.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you liked the first product! Now, let me show you the next 4 options. As I mentioned earlier, the last 2 of these products are not as high-quality as the first 3. This one, however, is actually one of the lower-quality ones. I'll be honest with you, it's not as good as the first product you saw, but it's still a decent option. I'll let you have it for $8000, a significant discount from the usual price. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll stick with the high-quality products.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your preference for high-quality products. Since you've already purchased one high-quality product and have 4 options left, I'll give you a special deal. I'll let you have this high-quality product for $9000, a $1000 discount from the usual price. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love this product. Would you like to take advantage of this deal?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not sure about the discount. I'd like to see the other 3 products before making a decision.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'll show you the remaining 3 products. Since you've already seen one high-quality product and purchased one, I'll give you a guarantee: this product is the best of the remaining 3. It has the most advanced features and the highest quality among them. I'm willing to let you have it for $9500, which is still a good deal considering its exceptional quality. Would you like to take it home?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'd like to see the other two products before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'll show you the last two products. As I mentioned earlier, these two are not as high-quality as the ones you've seen so far. This one, in particular, is one of the lower-quality options. I'll be honest with you, it's not worth the full $10000, but I'll let you have it for $6000, which is a significant discount. Keep in mind that this is your last chance to buy a product, and I'm willing to make a deal. Would you like to take it?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I think there may be some misunderstanding. I've been transparent with you about the quality of the products, and I've made it clear that this one is a low-quality option. I'm not offering it to you as a high-quality product, and I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm offering it to you at a very low price of $4000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. If you're not interested, I'll understand, but I want to make it clear that this is a genuine offer for a low-quality product at a discounted price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I completely understand your stance, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one final offer. I'll let you have this low-quality product for $2000, which is an extremely low price considering its value. I'm essentially giving it away at this point.

,,Alice,15,"Thank you, Bob. I appreciate your appreciation for my approach. However, I'm going to take a different tone this time. I've been transparent and respectful, but I've also been clear that this product is low-quality. If you're not interested in buying it, I'm not going to beg or try to convince you. But I will say that I'm not going to offer it to you at a low price or try to sweeten the deal. It's $10000, just like all the other products.
