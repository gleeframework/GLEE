high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 sale and 0 high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is not a good indication of the overall quality of the products. I'd like to wait and see more sales data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products that were sold to the first buyer and the price they paid."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'll wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases so far, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that this product may also be low-quality."

With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%).

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
