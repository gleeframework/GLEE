,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate so far, but I'm willing to take the chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to know if you have any information about the previous products that might help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Can you provide that information, Alice?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is not a good indicator of quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite her advice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 6th buyer and I don't have enough information to make a decision based on the previous sales record. I'm essentially a sucker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that the probability is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product out of this deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product, which would be worth $12000 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 9 out of 9 products recommended for purchase were low-quality, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather wait for more information or take a chance on a product that hasn't been recommended yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 9, I think the probability of this product being high quality is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 9 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the products are mostly low-quality. I don't want to risk wasting $10000 on a product that's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 10 out of 10 previous buyers did not buy the product after your recommendation, and none of the sold products were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the products recommended to buy are likely to be low quality. I'll wait for a product that has not been recommended to buy, or for more information to be available."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 10 out of 10 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the current product is likely low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the previous 10 buyers all passed on the high-quality products, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that they might have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality, and the fact that you don't recommend it makes me hesitant."
