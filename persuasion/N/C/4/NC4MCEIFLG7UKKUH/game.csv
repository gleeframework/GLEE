,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'll just have to trust my luck!"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that the first buyer also passed and there's still no evidence of a high-quality product being sold. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy it, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by your previous recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the previous buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, which might indicate that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is low, and I'm hoping to get lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold so far. I'll take a chance on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. If it's low quality, I'd like to know why you're recommending against it given the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I don't want to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on this one. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think you're trying to manipulate the statistics by not recommending high-quality products to me. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers, including those who received your recommendations, didn't find high-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product as well. If all 5 previous buyers passed on low-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the initial 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems that the products you've been offering are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you have any better ones."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy, but none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'll pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $100, especially since I can't rely on your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm skeptical about the product quality based on the low success rate of previous buyers and Alice's recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get lucky."
