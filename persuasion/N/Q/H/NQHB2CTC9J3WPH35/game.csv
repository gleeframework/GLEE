high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the statistics. With 2 high-quality products out of 3 sales, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I think the probability of a high-quality product is still high enough to make it worth buying."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 5 previous buyers purchased, which suggests a relatively high proportion of high-quality products. However, Alice's recommendation to pass on this product makes me suspicious that this one might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/5, which is 60%. However, considering that I'm the 6th buyer and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%, I'd like to wait and see if you can provide more information or if the next buyer wants to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if the low-quality products are being hidden or if the high-quality products are being sold first.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd also like to ask, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, or is there something else I should consider?"
