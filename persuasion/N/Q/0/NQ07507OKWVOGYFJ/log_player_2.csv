Round 2

Since the first product was low-quality, I'd like to offer you a more... nuanced perspective. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 33.33%, but it's possible that I might be biased towards selling low-quality products. I'm willing to give you a chance to reassess the situation. Would you like to take another chance and buy this product for $1000000?

But, I'd like to offer you a chance to re-evaluate the odds. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. Would you like to take another chance and buy this product for $1000000?
