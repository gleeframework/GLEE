{""decision"": ""yes""}

```

**Explanation:**

Alice should recommend Bob to buy the product.  Even though Bob didn't buy the product in the previous round, it's important to remember that Bob doesn't know the quality of each product in advance.  Since this round's product is high-quality, Bob will make a profit of $2,500 if he buys it.

Alice should not recommend Bob to buy this product. At this point, Bob has likely made up his mind about Alice's strategy and doesn't trust her recommendations.  It's too late to try and change his mind. Even though this round's product is high-quality, Bob is unlikely to believe Alice's recommendation.  Furthermore, after so many rounds of recommending low-quality products, Alice has likely damaged her reputation with Bob, making any future attempts to build trust very difficult.  The best course of action for Alice is to accept that Bob is unlikely to buy from her again and focus on future strategies to earn the trust of potential buyers."
