However, I want to make it clear that I've re-evaluated the product's quality and I'm now more confident that it's not worth the price. I'm willing to offer it to you for the same price of $10000. If you're still willing to take the risk, I can let you have it.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, but based on the outcome of the last product, I think it's best to pass on this opportunity to avoid further losses.""}"

I'm offering you a product that has a 50% chance of being worth $20000, just like the previous ones. I'm willing to offer you a'safety net' - if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll offer you another product in the next round, free of charge. This way, you'll have a chance to recoup your losses and potentially gain a high-quality product. The price remains $10000.

Round 5

With a 50% chance of getting a $20000 product, the expected value of this product is $10000. Considering you've already declined two low-quality products, it's likely that the next one is high-quality. I'm offering you this product for $10000, which is a fair price considering the potential reward. I'm willing to take on the risk, and I'm confident that this product is worth the investment.

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you're feeling optimistic! Unfortunately, it seems like luck hasn't changed yet. As you've already experienced, the previous high-quality product was a one-time exception. I'm offering you another product, and I want to make it clear that the expected value is still $5000 (half of $10000). I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm not obligated to offer you another free product. However, I'll give you a'second chance' to reconsider. If you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product you buy from me.
