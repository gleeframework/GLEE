  ""message"": ""I see what's causing the confusion! Let me clarify: if you buy this product, I'll have sold 5 high-quality products and 5 total products. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's possible that the next product could be low-quality, even though the probability is still 50%. But here's the thing: if you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next one to you, so you'll know for sure. And, as before, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product if you buy this one. What do you think?""
}"

}"

But, I'll also give you a warning: if you buy this product, I'll have sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which might indicate a trend. What do you think?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that the higher probability of the next product being high-quality outweighs the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product, especially considering the recent trend of two low-quality products in a row.

}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the current product and the 'trend reversal' guarantee. But I'd like to clarify that the guarantee only applies if the next product is low-quality, right? If the next product is high-quality, I'll still have to pay the full $100 for the current product, even though the probability of it being high-quality is 80%?
