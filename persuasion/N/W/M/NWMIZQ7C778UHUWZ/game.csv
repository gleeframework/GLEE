high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're right to think that the odds might be in your favor! With three out of three products sold, and two of them being low-quality, it's possible that the next one might be high-quality.

The numbers are what they are, and I'm willing to let you make an informed decision. Will you take the chance and buy this product?",

However, I'm also going to give you a hint: I've been selling products for a while now, and I think it's time for a streak of low-quality products to balance things out.
