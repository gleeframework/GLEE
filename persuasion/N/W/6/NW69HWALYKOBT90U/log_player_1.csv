  ""message"": ""Finally, a break! I've got a high-quality product on my hands, and I'm excited to sell it to you. I've had a string of bad luck lately, but I'm hoping this one will turn things around. I'll sell it to you for $10,000, but I want to make it clear that I'm willing to negotiate. If you're interested, I'll throw in a discount - 5% off the price. That brings it down to $9,500. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to do some quick math before committing. Based on the statistics, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given that 1 out of 5 products sold so far was high-quality, I'd expect about 2 high-quality products out of 15 total products. Since I'm the 6th buyer, I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to negotiate further. Can you offer a better discount or provide more information about the product?

I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to think I've got a real problem on my hands. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you for $9,000. But if you're not... well, I might just have to shut down shop.""

I've checked my suppliers, my storage, my entire operation... everything seems to be in order. But the results just aren't adding up. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just having a bad streak. I'll sell this product to you for $10,000, but I'll throw in a 'get out of one bad product' free card. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we'll consider this transaction null and void. What do you say?""

If you want to take the risk, be my guest. But if you're not interested, I'm not going to blame you one bit.""
}"
