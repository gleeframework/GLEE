,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the recommendation is based on your general sales record, which is currently empty. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold, which is not enough to establish a reliable pattern. I'd like to wait and see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the outcome. I'm interested in the probability of the product being high-quality, but I'd like to know the true quality before making a purchase."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I don't want to let the product go to waste."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's because of your past recommendations or the product's actual quality. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high quality based on the previous sales?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like to consider the fact that Alice has recommended 4 other buyers to buy the product, but only 3 of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendation may not be a reliable indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm a bit concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 3/4, which is higher than the expected 0.8. This might be a coincidence, but I'm not sure if I should take the risk. Can you tell me more about the products that were sold before me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
