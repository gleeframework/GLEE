,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the low-quality products are more common than high-quality ones, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 buyers have received a recommendation not to buy, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that Alice is likely recommending against low-quality products. Therefore, I'll pass on the product, hoping that the next buyer will be able to purchase it and get a better deal."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
