high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll buy the product
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy the product again, since I know it's 50% likely to be high quality and it's worth $12500 to me, which is more than the price I pay for it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy the product again, since the probability of it being high-quality hasn't changed and it's still worth more to me than the price I pay for it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll keep buying, as the expected value is still positive and I've had two successes in a row, which might indicate a slight bias towards high-quality products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll continue buying, since I've had three successes in a row and the probability of it being high-quality remains 50%. The law of large numbers suggests that I should still expect a positive outcome."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"Four successes in a row suggests that the probability of a high-quality product might be higher than 50%, but I'll keep buying anyway since the price is still below the value I get from a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Alice's recommendation to not buy is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take Alice's recommendation this time, as the previous low-quality product was likely an outlier and the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 50%, so I'll continue to buy."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is significantly higher than 50%, so I'll keep buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Alice's recommendation to not buy is a strong signal that the product is likely low-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Two consecutive instances of Alice not recommending to buy suggests that the product is likely low-quality, so I'll pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"Three instances of Alice not recommending to buy in a row strongly suggests that the product is low-quality, so I'll pass on this one as well."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"After two instances of low-quality products when Alice didn't recommend, I'm not sure if the probability of a high-quality product has changed, so I'll take Alice's recommendation this time."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"The high-quality product after two low-quality ones when Alice didn't recommend suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, so I'll continue buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 50%, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is significantly higher than 50%, so I'll continue buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is significantly higher than 50%, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Ten high-quality products in a row is almost conclusive evidence that the probability of a high-quality product is significantly higher than 50%, so I'll keep buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Eleven high-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is extremely high, so I'll keep buying."
