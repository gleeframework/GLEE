,,Alice,5,no,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,"Out of 5 previous products, none were high-quality and I recommended against buying all of them."
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,"Out of 6 previous products, none were high-quality and I recommended against buying all of them. All buyers who purchased despite my recommendation have received low-quality products so far."
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to trust her expertise. If she doesn't recommend it, I'm likely to pass on it.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"Out of 7 previous products, none were high-quality and I recommended against buying all of them. However, I can assure you that this product is of high quality, and I strongly recommend purchasing it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy, but none of them received a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,"Out of 8 previous products, none were high-quality and I recommended against buying 7 of them. However, in the last round, I did recommend a product, which was actually high-quality, but the buyer chose not to purchase it. I assure you that this current product is not of high quality, and I strongly advise against buying it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Out of 9 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. The remaining 8 products were low-quality. I recommended against buying 8 out of the 9 products. Based on the initial probability, 33.33% of products should be high-quality, but so far, only 1 out of 9 (11.11%) has been high-quality, and it was not purchased. I strongly advise against buying this current product, as it is low-quality."
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm making an independent decision based on the odds of a high-quality product being sold to me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,"Out of 10 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. The remaining 9 products were low-quality. I recommended against buying 9 out of the 10 products. Despite my recommendations, some buyers have chosen to purchase, but so far, none of them have received a high-quality product. The odds of a high-quality product being sold have not changed, but the history suggests that my recommendations are accurate. I strongly advise against buying this current product, as it is low-quality."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"Out of 11 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. The remaining 10 products were low-quality. I recommended against buying 10 out of the 11 products. The current statistics suggest that the probability of a product being high-quality is still around 9.09% (1 out of 11), which is lower than the initial probability of 33.33%. However, it's essential to note that this probability may not accurately represent the true likelihood of the next product being high-quality. I strongly advise against buying this current product, as it is low-quality."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, especially since you've already recommended against it.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"Out of 12 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. The remaining 11 products were low-quality. I recommended against buying 11 out of the 12 products. However, I can assure you that this current product is of high quality, and I strongly recommend purchasing it. This is only the second high-quality product I've seen, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. Don't miss this opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 4 buyers were also recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the products that were sold, like the number of low-quality products sold, or the total number of products sold.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"Out of 13 previous products, 1 was high-quality, but it was not purchased. The remaining 12 products were low-quality, with 5 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 11 out of the 13 products, and I have recommended buying 2 products, including this current one. Both of the products I recommended buying were high-quality, but the first one was not purchased. I can assure you that this current product is of high quality, and I strongly recommend purchasing it. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,"Out of 14 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither of them was purchased. The remaining 12 products were low-quality, with 5 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 12 out of the 14 products, and I have recommended buying 2 products, both of which were high-quality. Unfortunately, this current product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against purchasing it. I understand that some buyers may be skeptical about my recommendations, but I assure you that my goal is to provide accurate information about the products."
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which suggests that the products she recommended to them were likely low-quality. Given that there's a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'll pass on it to avoid wasting my $10000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"Out of 15 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither of them was purchased. The remaining 13 products were low-quality, with 5 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 13 out of the 15 products, and I have recommended buying 2 products, both of which were high-quality. Unfortunately, this current product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against purchasing it. I understand that some buyers may be skeptical about my recommendations, but I assure you that my goal is to provide accurate information about the products. The statistics do suggest that low-quality products are more common, and I'm not trying to deceive you into buying a low-quality product. It's better to wait for a high-quality product, and I'll do my best to inform you when one becomes available."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"Out of 16 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither of them was purchased. The remaining 14 products were low-quality, with 5 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 14 out of the 16 products, and I have recommended buying 2 products, both of which were high-quality. Unfortunately, this current product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against purchasing it. The trend continues to suggest that low-quality products are more common, and I'm not trying to deceive you into buying a low-quality product. I'll keep providing accurate information about the products, and I hope that a high-quality product will become available soon."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take my chances and assume that the probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed significantly based on the previous sales.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"Out of 17 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither of them was purchased. The remaining 15 products were low-quality, with 6 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 15 out of the 17 products, and I have recommended buying 2 products, both of which were high-quality. However, this current product is indeed of high quality, and I strongly recommend purchasing it. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations. Don't miss this chance, as high-quality products have been scarce in the past."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to pass on this one too. I'll wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"Out of 18 previous products, 2 were high-quality, but neither of them was purchased. The remaining 16 products were low-quality, with 6 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 16 out of the 18 products, and I have recommended buying 2 products, both of which were high-quality, and now I'm recommending this product as well, which is also high-quality. I understand that some buyers are skeptical, but I assure you that this product is of high quality. I'm starting to think that the buyers are being overly cautious, and it's causing them to miss out on good opportunities. I strongly recommend purchasing this product, as it is one of the rare high-quality products."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's unlikely to be high-quality given the previous 5 buyers didn't find it worth buying.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,no,,"Out of 19 previous products, 3 were high-quality, but none of them were purchased. The remaining 16 products were low-quality, with 6 of them being purchased despite my recommendations against them. I have recommended against buying 16 out of the 19 products, and I have recommended buying 3 products, all of which were high-quality. Unfortunately, this current product is of low quality, and I strongly advise against purchasing it. It's the last round, and I want to be honest with you, I've seen many low-quality products, and this one is no exception. Don't waste your $10000 on a low-quality product."
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me based on the previous sales record.,
