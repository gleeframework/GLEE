I'll throw in a second product of equal value, absolutely free, if you buy this one. That's right, you'll get two products for the price of one. And I'm still only asking $1000000. It's a deal that's too good to pass up, don't you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's been revealed to be low-quality.

I'm willing to offer you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $200000 on top of the $1000000. That way, you'll be getting a total of $1200000. What do you say, is that a deal worth considering?
