low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, and I'll find out its quality afterwards."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the recommendation. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might make her more likely to recommend a low-quality product to me. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation, but I'm also interested in the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the basis for your recommendation?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, and I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that she doesn't know the true value of the product to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the previous sales record, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a potentially valuable product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers received low-quality products, and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any new information that would make me confident in the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, as the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a potential bias in your recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the low sales record of high-quality products, which suggests a higher likelihood of the product being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 buyers have purchased the products despite the 0 high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products offered are all low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information asymmetry and buy a potentially high-quality product that others have rejected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products offered so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned about the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know more about the previous buyers who purchased the products. What were their experiences with the products?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not convinced by the recommendation and the statistics don't suggest a high-quality product is likely to be sold."
