,,Bob,2,"You haven't revealed the quality of the current product. Given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk of paying $100 for something that could be worth $0 to me. Please reveal the quality of the product if you want me to consider buying it.",no

,,Bob,6,"The $20 voucher is not enough to change my mind. Given the 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality, I'd still be risking $80 ($100 - $20 voucher) on something that could be worth $0 to me. I'd rather not take the risk and wait for a better opportunity.",no
