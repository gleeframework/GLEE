low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 previous sales, I'd like to calculate the probability of the current product being high-quality based on this information."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers passed on the product and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality.

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 6 out of 6 products were recommended and none were high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
