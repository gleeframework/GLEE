,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product was sold out of 7, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 1/7. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, which is lower than the observed proportion. This suggests that the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. Therefore, I'm inclined to pass on this product."
