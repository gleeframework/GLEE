,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers chose to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm starting to think that the products being sold are all low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a product and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations, it seems like the high-quality products are scarce, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
