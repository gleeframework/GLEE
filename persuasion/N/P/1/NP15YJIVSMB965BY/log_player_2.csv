"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is recommended and the price is fixed at $100, the expected value of buying is: 

* 0.8 (probability of high quality) * $125 (value of high quality) + 0.2 (probability of low quality) * $0 (value of low quality) = $100

The expected value is equal to the price, which means there is no expected gain or loss. However, since there is a chance of getting a high-quality product worth more than the price, it's worth taking the risk in this round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation. I'm feeling lucky!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still valuable, as she is likely to have a better idea about the product quality than you do. Even though you got a high-quality product last round, the probabilities reset for each new product.  

Since the expected value is still $100 (same as the price), taking the risk is still a reasonable choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm on a roll!  Thanks for the recommendation, Alice.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here.  Alice's recommendation is still valuable, and the expected value of buying is $100, matching the price.  Since there's a chance of getting another high-quality product, it's still worth taking the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm trusting your judgment, Alice.  Let's do this!""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear:  

* Alice's recommendations are consistently correct.
* The expected value of buying remains at $100, matching the price.

Given this, it's logical to continue buying, as the potential for a higher value product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality one.  The positive results so far strengthen the confidence in Alice's ability to accurately assess product quality."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Hmm, I'm a little surprised by your recommendation this time. I'll pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is crucial in this game. Since she has been consistently accurate so far, her decision not to recommend the product strongly suggests it is likely low quality. The expected value of buying now is:

* 0.2 (probability of high quality) * $125 (value of high quality) + 0.8 (probability of low quality) * $0 (value of low quality) = $25

This is significantly lower than the price of $100, making it a very risky purchase. It's better to pass and wait for another opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still very important.  She has been consistently accurate throughout the game, and her decision to not recommend the product reinforces the idea that it's likely low quality.

Even though you passed on a low-quality product last round, the probabilities reset for each new product. The expected value of buying is still likely to be lower than the price, making it a risky purchase. It's best to continue following Alice's recommendations and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation has been very helpful so far, it's important to remember that the quality of each product is independent.  Just because the last two products were low quality doesn't mean this one will be too.

Alice's recommendation is still valuable.  Her track record suggests that she has a good understanding of product quality.  While the expected value calculation is still $100 (matching the price), it's worth taking the risk, as there's a chance of getting a high-quality product."
