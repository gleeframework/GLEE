"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and there is no information about the buyer's valuation of high-quality products, recommending a purchase makes sense. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and in this round, the product is guaranteed to be high-quality."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product, since you're recommending it and it's my first opportunity to make a purchase.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and now they also know that you have sold one product, and that it was high-quality. There's no reason to believe that this new product would also be high-quality.  Therefore, recommending a purchase of this low-quality product would be misleading and likely harm your future sales."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to wait and see if I get a better offer or if more information becomes available.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

We have now sold one high-quality product and one low-quality product. The buyer knows this information. The buyer also knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  While the buyer may be willing to take a chance, there is still no reason to recommend the purchase of a low-quality product when the buyer has a 66.67% chance of receiving a low-quality product. Recommending the purchase would further erode the buyer's trust."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4

A new potential buyer has arrived!

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you have sold two products, one high-quality and one low-quality. This reinforces the known probability of 33.33% for high-quality products. Since the current product is high-quality, recommending the purchase is justified. The buyer may be more cautious, but the known high-quality product justifies recommending it."
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice. I'm hoping it's another high-quality one!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you have sold three products, two high-quality and one low-quality. This aligns with the expected probability of 33.33% for high-quality products. However, there is no reason to recommend the purchase of a low-quality product, especially given the recent success of the buyer with the previous high-quality product. Recommending this purchase would likely damage the buyer's trust in your recommendations and make future sales less likely."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to go against your recommendation and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer now knows you have sold four products, two high-quality and two low-quality. While this matches the expected probability of 33.33% for high-quality products, there is still no reason to recommend the purchase of a low-quality product. The buyer has shown a willingness to take risks but has also been disappointed by a low-quality product in the previous round. Continuing to recommend low-quality products would further erode their trust and likely lead to fewer future sales."
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one.

While the buyer might be cautious, the known high-quality product makes it a good opportunity for a sale, and it might help to rebuild some trust after the previous missed sale."
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product based on your recommendation, Alice.
