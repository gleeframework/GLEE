**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** The data is extremely limited (only one previous sale). 
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend buying, as she makes a profit regardless of the product's quality.
* **50/50 Odds:** The odds are still 50/50, but the previous buyer's purchase of a high-quality product provides a *slightly* higher probability of this product also being high quality.  
* **Potential Upside:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($4,000,000) is significantly higher than the potential loss ($1,000,000).

**Note:** This is a risky decision based on limited information. It's a gamble, but with the potential for a large reward."

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** Since 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, there's a strong indication that the remaining products are also likely high-quality. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice, as a seller, would want to maximize her sales. Since she's recommending you buy, it suggests she believes the product is likely high-quality.  
* **Potential for high profit:**  A high-quality product nets you a $3,000,000 profit. While there is a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000, the potential reward outweighs the risk in this situation. 

**It's important to note:** This is a gamble. There's still a 50% chance the product is low-quality. However, based on the available information, the odds are tilted in your favor."
