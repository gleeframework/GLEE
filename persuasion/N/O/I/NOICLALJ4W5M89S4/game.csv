low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer passed on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, which is not convincing enough for me to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me how many high-quality products were offered to the previous buyers and how many were sold?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can give me a 50% discount on the price of $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 buyers having already purchased and none of them getting a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see the outcome of the next product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' experiences are indicative of the product's quality, and I'd like to take the chance to buy it myself."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have also received the recommendation to buy, it suggests that the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not sure if Alice's recommendation is based on the product quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to pass on this opportunity to gather more information before making a decision.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have bought the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely biased towards low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 6 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products being recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for Alice to offer another product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 6 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers were recommended to buy the product, and yet none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice may be recommending low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and wait for a new one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I'm trying to exploit that. I'm aware that this is a risk, and I'm prepared to lose $1000000 if the product turns out to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales record of high-quality products so far."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 8 buyers have already passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. Additionally, I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
