low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to own a product from a seller with a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality item. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, a price that reflects the uncertainty of its quality. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to learn from my decision and adjust my strategy accordingly.,yes

,,Alice,2,You're aware that the previous buyer took a chance and bought a low-quality product for $10000. I'm offering you the same product at the same price. You now have more information about my selling record: 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts. Is this a risk you're willing to take?,
,,the buyer,2,I'd like to wait and see how many more buyers there are and what happens with the next product. I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen the trend so far: 2 low-quality products out of 3 attempts. I'd like to offer you a different perspective: if I were selling low-quality products at this rate, I'd have been shut down by now. There's a 33.33% chance that the next product is high-quality. Would you like to take the chance and buy this one for $10000?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, but I'm hoping it's high-quality!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've just bought a low-quality product, and now the statistics are 3 low-quality products out of 4 attempts. I'm not giving up yet! I'd like to offer you a deal: I'll give you a special 'insurance' - if the next product is indeed high-quality, I'll sell it to you for $5000. If it's low-quality, you still pay $10000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,4,I'm not convinced by the insurance offer. I'd like to wait and see the next product before making a decision.,no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've seen the numbers: 4 low-quality products out of 6 attempts, and 1 high-quality product out of 6 attempts. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'll give you a warning: if you buy this low-quality product, you'll be the 5th low-quality product out of 6 attempts. That's a pretty clear trend. Are you willing to bet against the odds?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite the trend. I'm hoping that the next product will break the pattern and be high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've just bought a low-quality product, making it 6 low-quality products out of 7 attempts. I'm starting to think I should just sell my remaining products at a garage sale. Seriously though, the odds are not in your favor. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell you the next product for $8000, but if it's high-quality, you have to pay me $12000. If it's low-quality, you still pay $8000. What do you say?",

I'll make you a deal: I'll sell you this product for $8000, and I'll throw in a 'get out of jail free' card - if the next product is low-quality, you can return this one and get a full refund. If the next product is high-quality, you still pay $10000 for this one. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'm not convinced by your sales record, and I'm not sure I trust your 'get out of jail free' card. I'd like to wait and see the next product before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've seen the numbers: 8 low-quality products out of 9 attempts. I'm starting to think I should just admit defeat. But I'm not giving up yet!

What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'm not convinced by your guarantee, Alice. I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you give me more information about the remaining product? Is it the same type as the previous ones? Are there any differences in the manufacturing process?",no

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad I could give it a try, but I guess I won't be selling anything else. Since I'm out of business, I'll just tell you that this is the last product I have, and it's a high-quality one. I'll sell it to you for $10000, but I won't be able to offer you any discounts or guarantees. It's a one-time sale, and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk.

I'm not going to try to sell it to you or make any deals. I'll just say that if you want to buy it, you can have it for $10000.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I think I've finally run out of words. I've been trying to sell products to you for 20 rounds, and I've failed. This is the 20th product, and it's a low-quality one. I'm not going to try to sell it to you or make any deals. I'll just say that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and you can take it or leave it for $10000. But honestly, I don't care anymore.",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take the product, but I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision based on your lack of enthusiasm.",yes
