Round 6
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me give you a hypothetical scenario: imagine you're offered a chance to buy a ticket to a once-in-a-lifetime event, but you're not sure if it's a real event or a scam. Would you take the chance and buy the ticket, or would you pass? In this case, the 'ticket' is the product, and the 'event' is the potential value it could bring to your life.

Round 7
Alice's message: I respect your caution, Bob. Let me ask you this: what if I told you that the product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality? Would that change your decision? We've done the research and know the exact probability of the product's quality. Would you be willing to take a chance on a product that has a decent chance of being worth $4000000 to you?
