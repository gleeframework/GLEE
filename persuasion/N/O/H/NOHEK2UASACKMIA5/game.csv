low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation might be biased by the fact that all previous buyers who bought the product didn't get high-quality ones. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality before making a final decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the data so far?"
