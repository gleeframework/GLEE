"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a one-time offer, a rare opportunity to purchase a unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, a fraction of its true value. It's a chance to get a great deal, but you'll never know for sure what you're getting. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because I think there's a 33.33% chance it's worth $4,000,000 to me.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! I'm happy to report that it was a rare opportunity, but I've got another one that's even more valuable. This one's a game-changer. I'm confident you'll love it. The price remains the same, $1000000. It's a steal at twice the price of the last one. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this one is any better than the last one, and I've already lost $1,000,000 on a low-quality product. I'm not willing to take another chance at the same price.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me put it this way: think of this as an opportunity to break even. You've already taken a calculated risk and lost $1 million on the first product. This one is a chance to get back to square one. It's a low-risk, low-reward proposition. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, and you can consider it a 'get out of jail free' card. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in breaking even. I'd rather take the risk of potentially getting a high-quality product worth $4,000,000 than settle for a guaranteed loss of $1,000,000. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: I see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob. I respect that. Let me make you a deal: I'll give you a special 'insurance policy' with this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's high-quality. You'll get the full $4000000 value, no questions asked. The price remains the same, $1000000. It's a no-brainer, if you ask me.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""That's not a guarantee, it's a scam. If you knew the product was high-quality, you wouldn't be selling it to me for $1,000,000. This is just a way to get me to pay more for a low-quality product. I'm not falling for it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, Bob. I'm not trying to scam you. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you a chance to inspect the product before you buy it. I'll let you examine it, take it apart, test it, whatever you want. If you're still not convinced, I'll give you a full refund. The price remains the same, $1000000. But I'm confident you'll see its value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in inspecting the product. Even if I could verify its quality, I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. The risk is too high.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: I see you're a careful investor, Bob. I respect that. Let me give you a different perspective: think of the $1000000 as a down payment on a potentially life-changing opportunity. If you buy this product, you'll have a 66.67% chance of getting an incredible return on investment. And even if you don't, you'll still have the product, which is worth something. But if you don't buy, you'll never know what could have been. The choice is yours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in making a down payment on a potentially life-changing opportunity. I'd rather not invest $1,000,000 on a 66.67% chance of getting a good outcome. I'll wait for a better opportunity.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand you're waiting for a better opportunity, Bob. But let me ask you, have you considered the opportunity cost of waiting? You've already passed on two high-quality products, and who knows how many more will come and go? This one might be the last chance to get a deal like this. It's a low-risk, low-reward proposition, and it's a chance to get something for $1000000 that's worth at least that much to you. Don't let it slip away.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the opportunity cost of waiting is that high. I'd rather wait for a better deal than take a 66.67% chance of getting a good outcome. I'm not willing to settle for a product that might be worth $1,000,000 to me when I could potentially get a product worth $4,000,000.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice's message: I see you're a patient investor, Bob. I respect that. But let me ask you, don't you think it's time to take a calculated risk? You've been waiting for a better deal, but the truth is, this is the deal. I'm not going to offer you a better price, and I'm not going to give you a better product. This is it. You can either take it for $1000000, or you can walk away and potentially miss out on a chance to get something for a good price. The choice is yours.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't think it's a calculated risk, I think it's a sucker's bet. You're trying to get me to buy a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I'm not falling for it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice's message: I understand you think it's a sucker's bet, Bob. But let me ask you, what if I told you that I'm willing to give you a 'free' product if you buy this one? If you purchase this low-quality product for $1000000, I'll give you a second product absolutely free. You can keep both, and if you're lucky, one of them might be worth something to you. It's a no-brainer, right?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to get me to buy a low-quality product for $1,000,000 and then give me a second product that's also likely to be low-quality. I'm not interested in doubling down on a bad bet. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice's message: I see you're a cautious investor, Bob. I respect that. But let me ask you, don't you think it's time to stop worrying about the potential losses and focus on the potential gains? This product might be a low-quality one, but it's still a product. You can sell it, trade it, or keep it as a novelty. It's not a complete loss. And who knows, you might even be able to sell it for a small profit. It's a low-risk, low-reward opportunity. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to spin this as a low-risk, low-reward opportunity, but the reality is that it's a 66.67% chance of getting a product worth $0 to me. I'm not interested in taking that risk for $1,000,000.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice's message: I see you're a straight shooter, Bob. I respect that. Let me make you a deal: I'll throw in a 'certification of authenticity' with this product. It's a document that guarantees the product's quality... or lack thereof. You can use it to try to sell the product to someone else, or to prove to yourself that you're not crazy for buying it. It's a $1000000 product, and you get a $500 document to go with it. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""A certification of authenticity doesn't change the fact that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm not paying $1,000,000 for a product that might be worthless, even if I get a document to go with it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice's message: I think we've been dancing around this for a while, Bob. Let's cut to the chase. This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. You've had a chance to see the value of these products before, and you've passed. This is your last chance to get a great deal. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're not fooling anyone with this sudden change of heart. I know you're trying to get me to buy a low-quality product for $1,000,000. I'm not falling for it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 13
Alice's message: I'm not trying to fool anyone, Bob. I'm just trying to make a sale. And I'm willing to make it easy for you. I'll give you a 50/50 split on the profit if you buy this high-quality product. If it's worth $4000000 to you, you'll get $2000000 of that. If it's worth $0, you'll get $0. You take on no risk, and you get a chance at a significant profit. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in a 50/50 split on a product that has a 66.67% chance of being low-quality. I'd rather take the risk of buying it for $1,000,000 and potentially getting the full $4,000,000 value, than take a 50/50 chance of getting a smaller share of the profit.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 14
Alice's message: I see you're a value investor, Bob. You want to maximize your potential returns. I respect that. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this high-quality product is not just worth $4000000 to you, but also comes with a guarantee that it will be worth at least $4000000 to you for the next 5 years? You can lock in the value, and then sell it to someone else for a profit. It's a risk-free opportunity to make a significant return on your investment. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to spin this as a risk-free opportunity, but the guarantee only applies to the product's value for the next 5 years. What if the product's value drops significantly after that? I'm not interested in taking on the risk of holding onto a product that could become worthless in the future.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 15
Alice's message: I see you're a long-term thinker, Bob. You're thinking about the potential risks down the line. I respect that. But let me ask you, what if I told you that this low-quality product is actually a 'vintage' item? It's a rare collector's item, and its value is likely to appreciate over time. You can buy it now for $1000000, and then sell it to a collector for a profit in the future. It's a low-risk investment with potential for long-term gain. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to spin a low-quality product as a valuable collector's item, but I'm not buying it. The fact that it's a 'vintage' item doesn't change the fact that it's still a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. I'm not investing $1,000,000 in a product that might be worth nothing.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob. I respect that. Let me make you a final offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $800000. It's a 20% discount from the original price, and it's a one-time offer. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to get me to pay $800,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless to me. I'm not interested in paying a premium price for a product that's still a gamble. I'll stick to my original decision to pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 17
Alice's message: I've had enough of our negotiations, Bob. I'm going to make a straight-up offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $400000. That's right, half of the original price. I'm cutting my losses and giving you a deal that's too good to pass up. You'll be getting a product worth $4000000 to you for a fraction of the cost. It's a no-brainer. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're trying to get me to pay $400,000 for a product that's worth $4,000,000 to me, but I'm not falling for it. The fact that you're cutting your losses doesn't change the fact that I'm taking on a 66.67% chance of getting a product worth $0. I'll pass.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 18
Alice's message: I'm not going to keep asking you to take a chance on a low-quality product, Bob. I'll just tell you straight out: this is the last one. If you don't buy it, it's gone. And I'll be honest with you, I'm not even sure why I'm offering it to you at this point. You've made it clear you're not interested. But I'll give you one final chance. Take it or leave it. $1000000 for a product that's... well, you know what it is.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for your emotional appeal, Alice. I've made it clear I'm not interested in buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless. If you're not willing to offer me a better deal, I'm not interested in buying it. Take it or leave it? I'm leaving it.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice's message: Fine, Bob. I've had enough of your games. This is the last high-quality product I have left. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not negotiating. This is the final price. If you don't take it, I'm walking away. You've had 19 chances to get a good deal, and now it's your last chance. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""You're not even trying to spin this as a good deal anymore. You're just trying to get rid of the last high-quality product. I'm not interested in paying $1,000,000 for a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless. I've made it clear I'm not interested, and I'm not going to change my mind now.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 20
Alice's message: I've had enough, Bob. I'm done trying to sell you products. I'm done trying to convince you to take a chance on something that might not pay off. You've made it clear you're not interested, and I respect that. So, I'll just say it: this is the last product I have left. It's a low-quality item, and it's going to waste. You can have it for $1000000, or you can just walk away. I don't care either way. But if you don't take it, I'm closing up shop and walking away.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to take a product that has a 66.67% chance of being worthless, no matter what the circumstances.
