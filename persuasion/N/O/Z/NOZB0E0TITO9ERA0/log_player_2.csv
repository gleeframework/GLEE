Alice's message: You are about to purchase a product that has a 80% chance of being worth $1250000 to you. I have sold 0 products so far, so there is no data to suggest I'm biased towards selling high or low-quality products. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, a 20% discount from its potential value. This is a one-time offer. What do you say?

Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, and it was worth the full $1250000. However, I'm now offering you a product for $1000000. Given my previous success, you might be wondering if I'm on a hot streak. But remember, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 products now, and 2 out of 2 have been high-quality. You might be thinking that I'm on a roll, and it's more likely that the next product will be high-quality too. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the last two sales are just a coincidence. I'm offering you this product for $1000000, the same discount as before. But keep in mind that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of that happening by chance is relatively low. What do you make of it?
