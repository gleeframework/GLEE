You might be thinking that I'm on a roll, and it's more likely that the next product will be high-quality too. However, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and the last two sales are just a coincidence. I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000, the same discount as before. But keep in mind that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of that happening by chance is relatively low. What do you make of it?""}"
"The buyer's message: I understand your point, but I'm going to take a chance and buy the product. With a 80% chance of being high-quality, I think the probability of it being low-quality is still relatively low, and I'm willing to take that risk for the potential gain.
