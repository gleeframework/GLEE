,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it with a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which would be a loss of $10000. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which would be a gain of $2500. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if it's the best decision. Can you tell me more about the product? Is it a one-of-a-kind product, or are there more where that came from?"
