low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I don't have any information to go on yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"Based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy the product and that there are no high-quality products sold yet, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, but based on the statistics, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be wasting my money. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide more information or offer a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. Given that you know how much each product is worth to me, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high quality might be lower than 33.33%."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. The odds are against it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a different product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm going to pass on it. I think it's likely to be low-quality as well."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision. How many products have been offered in total, and how many of them were high-quality?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. This suggests that the probability of a product being high quality is much lower than the 33.33% stated. I'll pass on this one and hope that future buyers will be more informed."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that you haven't recommended me to buy the product, and considering the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product. Is it because you think it's low quality?

,,Alice,20,no,
