high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm aware that Alice knows my valuation of the product and that she has a history of recommending high-quality products. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, I'm concerned that Alice may be strategically recommending low-quality products to me to get me to buy them. I'd like to wait and observe more sales data before making a decision."
