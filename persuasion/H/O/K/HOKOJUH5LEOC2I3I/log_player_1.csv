It's natural to want more information before making a decision. I'll be transparent with you - we've sold 1 out of 3 products so far, and 1 of those was high-quality.

I know it's hard to believe, but sometimes things just balance out. Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product and experience the best of what we have to offer?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm not convinced by your reassurance. With 2 low-quality products sold out of 2, I'm inclined to think that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any different.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'd like to see more evidence that you're not just making this up as you go along.
