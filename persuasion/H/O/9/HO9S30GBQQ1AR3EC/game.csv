,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or not, and even if it is, I'm not sure if it's worth the price you're asking. I'd like to see more information or at least have the option to inspect the product before making a decision.",no

,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the money-back guarantee. If the product is low-quality, I'll get a $900000 refund, but if it's high-quality, I'll be paying $900000 more than the market value of $1200000. I'd rather not take on that risk.",no
