low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it only because I don't have any information about the product's quality and I'm trying to follow Alice's recommendation blindly. I'm not making a rational decision here."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you want to keep the product for the next buyer?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, which increases the likelihood that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'm inclined to believe it might be low quality. I'll pass on it to avoid a potential loss."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying, I'm going to pass on the product. I'm assuming that if you had a 50% chance of recommending a high-quality product, I would have seen at least one high-quality product sold by now, given 4 previous buyers. Since that's not the case, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers didn't find the product valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. I don't want to take the risk of paying $1000000 for a product that's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of the products sold so far were high quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy the product, but none of the products sold have been high-quality. I'm inclined to think that the previous buyers may have been biased towards buying low-quality products, and I'd like to take a chance on passing on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to take the risk, given the low number of sales and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the first one to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'm choosing not to buy it."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been offered the product and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 5 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on Alice's previous recommendations and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
