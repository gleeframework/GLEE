,,Alice,12,"I understand your request for more information. To calculate the 75% success rate, we've sold a total of 20 products so far.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your request for more information. Given that 15 out of 20 products were high-quality, we can estimate the probability of the remaining unsold products being high-quality. Since we've sold 12 products so far, there are 8 remaining products. Assuming the probability of a product being high-quality is still 0.75, we can calculate the probability of the remaining products being high-quality as follows: 0.75^8 = 0.5225. This means that there is approximately a 52.25% chance that the remaining unsold products are high-quality. I want to assure you that we've taken every precaution to ensure the quality of our products, and I'm confident that this product will meet or exceed your expectations.
