Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Let's think about why:

* **Bob is skeptical:** Bob has seen a pattern of low-quality products. He's not going to trust a recommendation at this point.
* **The risk is too high:** Even if this product *is* high-quality, Bob knows the odds are heavily against him.  He's likely to lose money if he buys.

It's better to wait and see if Alice can build trust again."
