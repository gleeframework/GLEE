**Reasoning:**

* **No Information:** We have no information about the product's quality other than Alice's recommendation.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to maximize her sales. Since she knows the true value of each product, she is likely to recommend buying a high-quality product. 
* **Limited Risk:**  While there's a 50% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

Therefore, it's a gamble worth taking."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates a 100% success rate (5 high-quality products sold out of 5 buyers). This strongly suggests that Alice is making accurate recommendations. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy is a significant factor.  Given the high success rate, we can trust her judgment.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, the potential gain of $10,000 (selling price - cost) is significant.

**It's important to note:**  This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is being honest and acting in the buyer's best interest. If there's suspicion of manipulation, this decision would need to be reconsidered."
