Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products, which means I've maintained a 66.67% success rate.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to walk you through the probability calculation. Since I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 4 total products, the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 75% (3/4). However, I want to offer you a more nuanced view. If I were to continue selling products at the same rate, the expected number of high-quality products out of the next 4 products would be 3.2 (80% of 4). This means that, on average, I would expect 3.2 high-quality products out of 8 total products. Considering this, I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900000, which is a price that reflects the updated probability. It's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.
