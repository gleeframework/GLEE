If I were to continue selling products at the same rate, the expected number of high-quality products out of the next 4 products would be 3.2 (80% of 4). This means that, on average, I would expect 3.2 high-quality products out of 8 total products. Considering this, I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $900,000, which is a price that reflects the updated probability.
