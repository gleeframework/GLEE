Round 2
Alice's message: I understand your hesitation, Bob. I'd like to provide you with more context. I've been in the business for a while, and I can confidently say that the products I offer are generally worth the price. However, I also want to be transparent with you. I've had some issues with quality control in the past, and I'm willing to share that with you. If you're still not convinced, I can offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy, where you can return the product at any time and get a full refund. The price remains the same at $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your transparency, Alice, but I'm still not convinced.

I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a separate ticket that will give you a chance to win a free high-quality product from the remaining 17 products.
