When we've sold a high-quality product, it tends to be followed by another high-quality product. In fact, our data shows that the probability of the next product being high-quality increases by 10% after a high-quality product has been sold. Given that we've just sold a high-quality product, the probability of this one being high-quality is now 90%.
