With the first product being low-quality, the chances of getting a high-quality item have just increased. I'm willing to bet that this product is worth way more than $1000000.

Alice's message: I understand your caution, but I'd like to highlight that two high-quality products in a row is a strong trend. This could be a sign that our products are consistently high-quality, and you're missing out on a great opportunity. With 2 out of 3 products being high-quality so far, the probability of this one being high-quality is even higher. Are you willing to take advantage of this streak and make a purchase for $1000000?

Additionally, the fact that two high-quality products in a row is a strong indication of our product's quality. I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity to own a high-quality product at a fixed price of $1000000. Don't miss out on this chance to get a high-quality product at a great value.

Alice's message: Congratulations on taking the risk and making a purchase! I'm glad to hear that you're willing to take a chance. Now, let's focus on the next product.

Another buyer was neutral, saying it was a decent product but not exceptional. And the third buyer was disappointed with their low-quality product, feeling it wasn't worth the risk.
