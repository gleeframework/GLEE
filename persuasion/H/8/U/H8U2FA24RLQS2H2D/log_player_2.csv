Alice's message: Hello buyer, I'm glad to provide more context about the previous buyers. The first buyer was hesitant due to a lack of information about the product's quality, which is understandable given that it was the first round. The second buyer was skeptical, but still decided to purchase the product. Unfortunately, that product was of low quality. The third buyer was also skeptical, but decided to trust my assessment and purchased the product, which turned out to be of high quality. Now, regarding this product, I can assure you that it meets the highest standards of quality, just like the previous high-quality product. I'm starting to build a track record, and I hope that my transparency will help you make a more informed decision. The price remains $10000.

I don't have any specific characteristics to share about the products, as they are quite unique, but I can tell you that my assessment is based on a thorough evaluation.
