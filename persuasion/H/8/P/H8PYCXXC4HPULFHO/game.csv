,,Alice,5,"You're a bold one, I like that! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think that you might be taking advantage of my generosity. Given that you've bought two products at the maximum price of $10000, and both of them turned out to be low-quality, I'm starting to wonder if you're just trying to get a good deal. If you're still interested in buying this product, I'll reveal its quality after you've made a decision. But if you're not, I might have to start reevaluating our business relationship.",
