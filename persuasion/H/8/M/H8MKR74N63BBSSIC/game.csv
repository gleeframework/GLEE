,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to take a risk and offer it to you at this price because I believe you're a savvy buyer who can appreciate its worth.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only paying $1000000 because I'm not sure if the next product will be of higher quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're pleased with the first product! However, I want to be transparent with you. The product you're looking at now is a lower-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm not trying to hide its value. I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it, considering the price is the same as the high-quality product. Think about it - if you don't buy this one, you might miss out on a great opportunity to purchase a high-quality product at the same price.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I know there's a 80% chance of a high-quality product being available in the next round.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation last round, but I'm glad you're willing to consider this high-quality product. I'll let you in on a secret: I've been keeping track of our previous conversation, and I think you're a buyer who values quality. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000, but I'm also willing to make a deal with you. If you buy this product, I'll give you a special offer for the next round's product - if it's a high-quality product, I'll sell it to you for $900000, which is a 10% discount. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the high-quality product for $1000000, and I'll consider your offer for the next round's product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're pleased with the high-quality product! As promised, I'm offering you a special deal for the next round's product. Since this one is also high-quality, I'll give you an even better deal. If you buy this product, I'll sell it to you for $900000, just like I mentioned earlier. But, I'll also throw in a bonus: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next round's product, regardless of its quality. So, if you buy this one, you'll get the high-quality product for $900000, and the next one for 10% off the list price of $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the high-quality product for $900000, and I appreciate the bonus offer for the next round's product.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Since you've already taken advantage of the discount on the last high-quality product, I'll make you an even sweeter offer. This high-quality product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. Plus, the 10% discount on the next round's product is still on the table. But, I'll also give you an additional 5% discount on the next round's product, making it a total of 15% off the list price. You're getting an incredible deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not sure if this high-quality product is worth $800000 to me, considering I already have two high-quality products worth $3000000 each. I'd rather wait and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation, but I think I can change your mind. Since you're already holding onto two high-quality products worth $3000000 each, I'll give you an even more compelling reason to buy this one. If you purchase this high-quality product for $800000, I'll not only give you the 15% discount on the next round's product, but I'll also throw in a 'buyback guarantee'. If you decide to sell one of your existing high-quality products in the future, I'll buy it back from you for $3500000. This way, you'll essentially get a guaranteed minimum return on investment for one of your existing high-quality products. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the buyback guarantee, and I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a high-quality product when I already have two of them. I'll wait and see what the next product is.",no

,,Alice,7,"I understand your position, but I want to make one last offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the same price as the last one: $800000. However, I'll also give you a 'holdback' option. If you buy this product, you can hold onto it for the next round, and if the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you the option to swap this one for the new product. This way, you'll get to keep the high-quality product you already have, and you'll have the chance to upgrade to an even better one. What do you think?",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Since you've taken advantage of the holdback option, I'll give you a special upgrade offer. You can swap the high-quality product you just bought for this new one, and I'll give you an additional 10% discount on the new product. This means you'll get a brand new high-quality product for $720000. Plus, you'll still have the option to hold onto this new product for the next round, and if the next product is high-quality, you can swap it again. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I'll take the new high-quality product for $720000, and I'll hold onto it for the next round.",yes
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,

I'll sell it to you for the same price as the previous one: $720000. But, I'll also throw in a 'best-of-three' guarantee. If you buy this product and hold onto it, and the next product is also high-quality, I'll give you the option to keep either of the two high-quality products, and sell the other one back to me for $3500000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?",

,,Alice,10,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make one last attempt to convince you. Since you've already passed on the best-of-three guarantee, I'll offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal. This high-quality product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the lowest price I've ever offered: $600000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you don't take it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on a great opportunity. What do you think?",

,,Alice,12,"I understand you're not interested in buying another high-quality product, and I respect your decision. However, I want to make you an offer on this low-quality product. Since you've already passed on several high-quality products, I'm willing to give you a 'value deal' on this one. I'll sell it to you for $400000, which is 60% of the original price. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a good deal on a product that's still worth something. What do you think?",
