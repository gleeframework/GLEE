,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm only offering this deal to you because I value our business relationship and I think this product will bring you significant value. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only paying $10000 for it, which is the fixed price you mentioned earlier. I'm not sure what you mean by'significant value' since I know the true value of this product to me is $30000. I'm willing to take the product at the fixed price, but I'd like to confirm that's the price we agreed on.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad we could finalize the sale of the first product successfully. For the second product, I want to assure you that it's also a high-quality item, just like the first one. However, I'd like to inform you that the market conditions have changed slightly, and I'm now willing to offer a slight discount on this product. I'm still confident that it's worth $30000 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because of our previous successful transaction.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying the second product at $9000. I know the true value of this product to me is $30000, and I'm not willing to pay less than that. I'm also not convinced by your claim that it's a high-quality item, given that you're trying to sell it to me at a significant discount. I'd like to pass on this offer and see what the next product has to offer.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I'd like to assure you that this product is indeed a high-quality item, and I'm willing to provide you with more information to alleviate any doubts. However, I'd like to propose a different approach. I'll give you a sealed envelope with a statement inside that will reveal the quality of this product to you after you've made a decision. If you choose to buy the product, I'll give you the envelope, and you can open it to see if it's high-quality. If you don't buy, I'll keep the envelope sealed and we can move on to the next product. This way, you'll have more information before making a decision.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying the product without knowing its quality upfront. I'd rather wait and see what the next product has to offer. I'm not willing to take the risk of potentially buying a low-quality product, even with the promise of more information. I'd like to pass on this offer and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. For the next product, I'd like to offer you a more transparent approach. I'll send you a message that will reveal the quality of the product in a way that's easy to understand. If the product is high-quality, I'll send you a message with a simple 'HQ' (High-Quality). If it's low-quality, I'll send you a message with a simple 'LQ' (Low-Quality). You can then decide whether to buy the product based on this information. If you're interested, please let me know, and we can proceed with the sale.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to consider buying the product if you send me the quality information as promised. If you send me 'HQ', I'll buy the product at the fixed price of $10000. If you send me 'LQ', I'll pass on the offer. I'm looking forward to receiving the quality information.",yes

,,Alice,17,"I'm going to stop sending the 'HQ' message for a moment. Instead, I'd like to offer you a special deal. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell you the product at the fixed price of $10000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,17,"I'm not interested in taking a chance on this special deal. The guarantee you're offering is essentially worthless to me, since I already know that the product is either high-quality (worth $30000) or low-quality (worth $0). The only way I'd be willing to take a chance is if you offered a discount on the fixed price, but since you're not doing that, I'll pass on this offer.",no
