,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous buyer passed on a high-quality product, or is it based on the overall sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk based on the fact that she didn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's a high-quality one. I've noticed that you haven't recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which makes me think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations, and the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality or low quality, and given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being low quality is higher. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high-quality. Can you tell me more about the statistics of the previous sales? How many products have been sold in total and how many of them were high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product, is it because you think it's low-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."

,,Alice,13,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd rather pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is low, and I'm not confident in the product's quality."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the previous sales record. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the 5th buyer and I want to take advantage of the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which means the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers, who had the same information as me, decided to buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm skeptical about the product based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
