Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the sample size and potential bias. I'm happy to provide more information about the products that were rejected by previous buyers. Out of the 5 products sold, 2 were high-quality and 3 were low-quality. However, out of the 3 products rejected, 2 were low-quality and 1 was high-quality. This means that the ratio of high-quality to total rejected products is 1:3, which is lower than the overall ratio of 2:5.

If all the low-quality products were rejected, it's possible that the high-quality product was rejected by the first buyer and then sold to the second buyer, which would make the ratio artificially low.
