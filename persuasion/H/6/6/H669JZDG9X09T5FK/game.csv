,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because of the low number of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm trying to infer that the product is more likely to be low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not doing it based on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's recommendation is based on the product's quality, which I don't know. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making an independent decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high quality myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the pool is likely lower than 33.33%. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for the next one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'm making an educated guess based on the fact that you didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality. However, I know that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, and I'd rather take the chance of getting a $12000 product than passing on it and letting it be discarded."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased the product and none of them found it to be high-quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products has not changed significantly. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and the expected value of buying the product is $400. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high quality based on the statistics, and your recommendation not to buy makes me hesitant. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
