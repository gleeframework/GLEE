Alice's message: I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and 2 total products. This is the second product, and I'm offering it to you for $100.

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, and 3 total products. You're aware of the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. Given the two consecutive high-quality products, it's reasonable to infer that I might be selling more high-quality products than average.
