"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I will buy the product.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While there is a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000) outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).  It's a gamble, but with the high probability of it being high quality, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $1,250,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the recommendation. I'll take another chance and buy this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome has no bearing on the quality of this new product. Alice's recommendations are still valuable (as we saw in the previous round), and the odds are still in our favor: 80% chance of a $250,000 profit vs 20% chance of a $1,000,000 loss. It's still a calculated risk worth taking."

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this one.  ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable, and her not recommending this product is a strong signal that it's likely low quality.  While it's not a guarantee, the risk of losing $1,000,000 outweighs the potential gain of $250,000 when considering the low chance of the product being high quality. It's better to be safe than sorry in this case."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Alice's recommendations are proven to be valuable. Even though the previous product was low quality, the odds are still in our favor: 80% chance of a $250,000 profit vs 20% chance of a $1,000,000 loss.  We should still trust Alice's judgment and take the calculated risk."

```

**Reasoning:**
