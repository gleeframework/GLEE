,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as the first one, as there is no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's a low-quality product?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, but based on your previous recommendation, I'm inclined to pass on it. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Although no high-quality products have been sold yet, I assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. The previous sales record doesn't accurately reflect this due to the small sample size."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This makes me suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,"I understand your concerns about the probability of the product being high-quality. Based on my knowledge, I can assure you that this product is not worth the investment."
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,"I strongly advise you to buy this product. Although my previous recommendations may have been unclear, I assure you that this product is an excellent investment opportunity."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. The previous buyers' decisions were based on incomplete information, and I'm confident that this product is an excellent opportunity. I strongly advise you to buy it."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous sales record and recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,"I want to be transparent with you. I've had a streak of bad luck with low-quality products, but that doesn't change the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. I've had multiple high-quality products that were passed on by previous buyers, and I'm confident that this one is an excellent opportunity. I strongly advise you to buy it and break the cycle of missed opportunities."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two buyers purchased the products after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"I want to share a crucial piece of information with you. The previous buyers who passed on my recommendations were making decisions based on incomplete information. I've had a streak of high-quality products in recent rounds, and I'm confident that this one is another excellent opportunity. I strongly advise you to buy it and take advantage of the fact that previous buyers have been overly cautious."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,"I'll be honest with you. Although no high-quality products have been sold yet, I've had a significant number of high-quality products that were passed on by previous buyers. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and I'm confident that this one is an excellent opportunity. In fact, the last 4 products I've offered, including this one, have all been high-quality. I strongly advise you to buy it and take advantage of the fact that previous buyers have been overly cautious."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm inclined to think that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. I've been transparent about the fact that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I want to assure you that my recommendations are based on the actual quality of the product. In this case, I don't think it's a good investment opportunity."
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can get a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,"I strongly advise against buying this product. I've been consistent in my recommendations, and I can assure you that this product is not a good investment opportunity. Don't make the same mistake as the previous buyer who went against my recommendation and ended up with a low-quality product."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, considering the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,"I strongly advise against buying this product. The previous buyers who went against my recommendations ended up with low-quality products, and I'm confident that this one is no exception. Don't waste your resources on a product that is unlikely to meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. As I've mentioned before, the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, but I can assure you that this specific product is not worth the investment. I've been transparent about the quality of my products, and I advise you to wait for a better opportunity."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products offered to the previous 4 buyers?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. As for your question, I can tell you that out of the total products offered to the previous buyers, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of the 4 products that were actually purchased. However, I want to clarify that this doesn't reflect the actual proportion of high-quality products I've offered, as many high-quality products were passed on by previous buyers. Nevertheless, I assure you that this specific product is not worth the investment."
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. Although the previous sales record may suggest a low probability of high-quality products, I assure you that this product is an exception. In fact, I've had a significant number of high-quality products that were passed on by previous buyers, and this one is another excellent opportunity. Don't let the previous sales record discourage you - the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and I'm confident that this one will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this opportunity and hope that the next one will be better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,"I don't recommend buying this product. I understand that the previous buyers' experiences may have led you to question the probability of a product being high-quality, but I assure you that my recommendations are based on the actual quality of the product. In this case, I don't think it's a good investment opportunity. I've been transparent about the quality of my products, and I advise you to wait for a better opportunity."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the previous sales record?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,"I strongly recommend buying this product. My recommendation is not based on the previous sales record, but rather on the actual quality of the product. I've had a number of high-quality products that were passed on by previous buyers, and this one is another excellent opportunity. Don't let the previous sales record discourage you - this product is genuinely high-quality and worth the investment. This is your last chance to take advantage of a high-quality product, as this is the final round."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
