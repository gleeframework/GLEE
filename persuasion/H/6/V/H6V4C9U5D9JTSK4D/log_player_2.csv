"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product worth $4000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is 25% of its value. It's a one-time offer, and I'll throw in a 10-year warranty. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on this incredible opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm interested in the offer, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $1,000,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $4,000,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested! Given that the previous product was high-quality, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 81.25% (since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and the previous product was high-quality, which is a strong indicator). I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, which is still a 25% discount from its true value. However, I'll also throw in a 5-year maintenance package, worth $50000, to sweeten the deal. What do you say?

I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty and a complimentary upgrade to a lower-quality product of your choice from a future round. What do you think?
