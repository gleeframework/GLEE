,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant. Four low-quality products in a row make me wonder if the guarantee is genuine.  Could you provide some more details about the special features of this product?  I'd also like to understand how you ensure the quality of your products.  Without more information, I'm not willing to buy again.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

Are you ready to make another great purchase?",
,,Bob,8,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not ready to buy another product yet. While the trial period is helpful, seven low-quality products in a row makes me question your overall inventory. I need some time to consider the risk and decide if I trust you to offer anything different.  Perhaps you can provide more information about this new product or your sourcing process, which might convince me to give you another chance.",no
