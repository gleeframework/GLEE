high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/2, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but the lack of sales so far makes it difficult to estimate the quality. However, Alice's recommendation to buy is based on her knowledge of the product's value to me, which is $0 for low-quality products and $125 for high-quality products. Given that Alice's recommendation is to buy, it's likely that she believes the product is high-quality. Nevertheless, I'd rather play it safe and pass on the product for now."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50% and the probability of it being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'll wait for a different recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are biased towards selling low-quality products. I'd like to see a more balanced recommendation history before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm willing to take the risk based on the current statistics."
