Alice's message: You're right to question my decision-making process. I'm a seller who's trying to maximize my sales, and I don't have any personal stake in the outcome. I sold the low-quality product in round 1 because I was trying to make a sale, and I didn't have any information that would have led me to believe it was low-quality. In hindsight, it was a mistake. But I've learned from it, and I've been more careful with my sales decisions since then. This product, however, is definitely low-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a good deal on a product that's worth $0 to you.
