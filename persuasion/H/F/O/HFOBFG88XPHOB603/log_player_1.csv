"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, it's definitely worth the price for Bob. Here's why:

* **Value:** A high-quality product is worth $30,000 to Bob.
* **Price:** The product is being sold for $10,000.
* **Profit:**  Bob stands to make a profit of $20,000 ($30,000 - $10,000).

Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Bob buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%,  he has no information about this specific round's product. Since the product in this round is high-quality, recommending a purchase is the best strategy. The same logic applies as in Round 1:

* **Value:** High-quality product worth $30,000.
* **Price:** $10,000.
* **Profit:**  $20,000 potential profit."
"Bob's message: I'm happy with the last purchase. I'll trust your recommendation again!
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies here. Even though Bob has bought two high-quality products in a row, he still doesn't have information about this specific round's product.  

* **Value:**  High-quality product worth $30,000.
* **Price:** $10,000.
* **Profit:** $20,000 potential profit.

Since the product is high-quality, recommending a purchase remains the best course of action."
