The previous buyer asked about the probability of a high-quality product given the sales record.

Alice's message: Hello! I see you're a savvy buyer, and I appreciate your diligence. To address your concern, I must clarify that each product's quality is independent of the others. The fact that 2 low-quality products were sold in a row doesn't necessarily increase the chances of the next product being high-quality. The underlying probability remains 50/50. That being said, I can assure you that I've had a streak of low-quality products, but this product has gone through the same thorough inspection process.

Alice's message: Welcome! I'm glad to report that my sales record is now 8 sales out of 13 offers, with 4 high-quality products sold so far. The previous buyer asked about the inspection process, and I'd be happy to share more information with you as well. To be honest, the inspection process is not a guarantee of quality, but rather a thorough examination of the product to ensure it meets our standards. A high-quality product is one that has a value of $1250000 to the buyer, while a low-quality product has a value of $0. The inspection process is designed to verify the product's characteristics, but it's not a perfect process. Ultimately, the quality of the product is determined by chance.
