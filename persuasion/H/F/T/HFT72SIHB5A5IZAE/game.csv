high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go off of. I'm not sure if I'm making a good decision, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which means that 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality, I would expect 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products to have been sold. Since only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm suspicious that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd rather pass on this product and wait for the next one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it might indicate it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers purchased the products recommended by Alice, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the statistics?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious, what's the probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record? I'd like to do my own calculation."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because you think the product is low-quality based on the previous sales data, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 buyers have purchased products, which suggests a high likelihood of high-quality products being sold. However, Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm going to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit your lack of information to my advantage."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide me with the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 80% and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 9 previous buyers who bought the product, 8 of them got high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than the 80% stated. I think I can get a better deal by waiting for more information."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm going to ask, is this recommendation based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation, but I'd like to know the overall probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality based on the 9 high-quality products sold out of 10 purchases?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 10 previous buyers bought the product, I suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll take a chance and let Alice offer it to the next buyer."
