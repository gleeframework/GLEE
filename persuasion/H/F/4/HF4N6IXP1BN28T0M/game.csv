To be honest, I was hoping to get more sales before sharing my statistics, but I'm willing to be transparent. The reason I think the success rate is higher than expected is that I've been focusing on selling the better products to people who are more likely to appreciate their quality. I've been trying to 'filter' out the low-quality products to the buyers who are less discerning. Of course, this isn't a foolproof method, but I believe it's improved my overall success rate. Would you like to take a chance on this product and see if you're one of the lucky ones?",
