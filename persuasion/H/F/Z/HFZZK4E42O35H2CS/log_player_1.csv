"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's in his best interest to buy. Even if he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the potential benefit outweighs the risk.  This is a standard Bayesian approach - the prior probability of the product being high quality is 50%, and the evidence (it is high quality) increases the probability of it being beneficial to buy."
