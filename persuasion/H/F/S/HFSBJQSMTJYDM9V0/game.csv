low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision before making my own. Was the product they bought low-quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $1000000 for it, hoping to get a $3000000 return."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than the overall average.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the statistics show 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm skeptical about buying a product that has been recommended by Alice, especially since none of the previous 6 buyers were able to get a high-quality product. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that if all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that this product is low-quality as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm skeptical about the product's quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 7, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'll take the chance to buy it."
