However, I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality. If you're interested, I can give you a 50/50 chance to inspect the product before buying it, but you'll still have to pay the full price of $10000.

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you were willing to take the risk and buy the product. However, I want to inform you that the product you just bought is not as good as I initially thought. In fact, it's even lower quality than the one we had in the first round. I'm offering you another product for $10000, and I want to make it clear that this one is not an inspection offer. You're buying it as-is, and you won't get a discount or any additional information about its quality. Are you still willing to take the risk and buy it?

I'm offering you this product for $10000, and I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. You can choose to buy it or not, but keep in mind that the odds are against it being a high-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality. The discount is tempting, but I'll take the risk without it. I believe in your assessment, and I'll buy the product at the discounted price of $9500.""}"

Round 6
Alice's message: I'm glad you trusted my assessment of the last product! However, I want to remind you that my confidence in this product's quality is not as strong as it was last time. In fact, I'm not making any claims about its quality at all. I'm simply offering it to you for $10000, and you'll have to decide based on your own judgment. Keep in mind that you've already bought one high-quality product from me, and I'm not trying to deceive you. You can choose to buy it or not, but I want to make it clear that I'm not hiding anything from you.

I'll give you a'reverse guarantee': if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% refund. If it's low-quality, you'll still have to pay the full price, but I'll give you a unique opportunity to inspect the product before buying it, and you can decide if you still want to proceed.
