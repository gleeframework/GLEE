**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited (only one previous sale), it suggests a 100% success rate for high-quality products.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the value of each product and is likely recommending this product because she knows it's high quality.
* **Potential Gain:**  Even with the 20% chance of low quality, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Important Note:** This is a very simplistic analysis. In a real scenario, we'd want to consider much more data, the seller's reputation, and the possibility of Alice manipulating the data to her advantage."

**Explanation:**

The statistics provided show that 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality.  While there's always a chance the current product is low quality, the data strongly suggests it's high quality.  Since a high-quality product is worth $125 to me and the price is only $100,  it's a good value proposition even with the risk."
