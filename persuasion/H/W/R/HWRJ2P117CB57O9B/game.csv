low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice doesn't recommend the product and considering the higher probability of a product being low quality, I'll choose not to buy it this time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Similar to the previous round, since Alice doesn't recommend the product and the odds are against it being high quality, I'll pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, the overall pattern still suggests that most products Alice doesn't recommend are low quality. I'll stick with my strategy for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"The last round reinforced the pattern, so I'll continue to trust Alice's non-recommendations as a sign of low product quality."
