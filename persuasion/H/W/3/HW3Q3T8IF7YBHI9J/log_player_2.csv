Alice's message: So far, I've sold 1 out of 2 products to buyers. Given the high probability of high-quality products (80%), it's likely that the product I have now is also of high quality. I'm willing to offer you a chance to buy it for $10000. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the calculated risk. Now, let me offer you a more nuanced view of the situation. You've seen that I've sold 2 out of 3 products to buyers, and both were high-quality. Given the probability of high-quality products, it's likely that the product I have now is also of high quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll lose $10000. But if you don't buy it, I'll still have a 20% chance of having a low-quality product left, which would also be a loss for you. Would you like to take the chance and buy the product for $10000?
