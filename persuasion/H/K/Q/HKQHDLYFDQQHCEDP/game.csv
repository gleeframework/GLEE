low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a product at a discounted price. If you buy it, you'll get a product that is 1/3 as valuable as the average product I have in stock. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a steal considering the average product's value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not convinced by your sales pitch. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll be honest with you, this product is not my best one. In fact, it's the same type of product you passed on last round. If you buy it, you'll be getting a product that is likely to be of similar value to the one you just passed on. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a chance to get a second product that's probably not worth much more than the first one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not falling for it. I think you're trying to trick me into buying another low-quality product. I'll pass again.,no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're cautious, but this time I'm offering you a truly exceptional product. I've been in this business long enough to know that every now and then, a gem comes along. This product is one of them. It's worth a lot more than the last two products you saw, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. I'm taking a loss on this one, but I think you'll appreciate its value. Take a chance and buy it, you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,3,I'm willing to take a chance on this one. I'll buy the product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the last product! As promised, it's a high-quality one. Now, about this next product... I want to be upfront with you. I've already sold you one high-quality product, and I'm not going to try to trick you again. This product is not as good as the last one. In fact, it's one of the lower-quality ones. But, I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a chance to get a product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value. You can think of it as a 'discount' on a product that's not worth much.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a 'discount' price. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand you're being cautious again. Let me ask you a question: do you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product or a low-quality product in this round? If you think I'm trying to sell you a high-quality product, it's likely that I've already sold you the high-quality product in one of the previous rounds, and I'm trying to trick you again. But if you think I'm trying to sell you a low-quality product, then this is just another low-quality product. Either way, the price is still $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I think you're trying to sell me a low-quality product in this round, so I'll take the chance and buy it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a clever one, I'll give you that. I was trying to sell you a low-quality product this round, and you called my bluff. Well, it looks like you're getting a second low-quality product in a row. I'm not going to try to trick you again, I promise. This one is indeed a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. You're getting a great deal on a product that's not worth much. Think of it as a 'pair' of low-quality products at a discounted price.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even at a 'discount' price. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I see you're consistent in your decision-making. I'll try a different approach. Let's talk about the two low-quality products you've already seen. You've passed on both of them, and now you're facing another one. I'm willing to make a bet with you: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you can identify which of the three low-quality products I've shown you is the worst one. If you can do that, I'll refund you the $100, and you can keep the product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the bet! I'll buy the product and try to identify the worst one.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a risk-taker, I like that! Now that you've taken the bet, I'll give you a hint: the worst low-quality product is the one that's been sold to you already. Think about it... which one of the three low-quality products you've seen so far do you think is the worst? Remember, if you can identify it correctly, you'll get a full refund. The price remains the same: $100.",
,,Bob,8,I think I have it! I'm going to take a chance and say that the worst low-quality product is the one from Round 2. Am I correct?,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Congratulations, you're absolutely right! The low-quality product from Round 2 was indeed the worst one. You've won the bet and you'll get a full refund for that one. Well done! Now, let's move on to the next product. This one is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. I know you've been burned before, but I assure you that this one is a gem. It's worth much more than the low-quality products you've seen so far. Take a chance and buy it, you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm glad I won the bet! And now, I'm willing to take a chance on this high-quality product. I'll buy it.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're feeling confident after winning the bet! And I'm happy to report that this next product is also a high-quality one. You're on a roll! This product is similar to the one you just bought, but it's slightly different. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. You're getting a second high-quality product in a row, and I'm taking a loss on this one. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price that's lower than its true value. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,I'm feeling good about my chances! I'll take the second high-quality product at the same price.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're on a hot streak! Two high-quality products in a row is impressive. I'm starting to think you're a high-quality product connoisseur. This next product is also a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. But I'll make you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a special guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with this product, I'll give you a full refund and we'll call it a day. No questions asked. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,I'm feeling confident! I'll take the third high-quality product and take you up on your guarantee. I'm willing to trust that this product is as good as the previous two.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a man of confidence, I like that! I'm glad you're trusting me with the guarantee. Unfortunately, I have to break the streak. This next product is not a high-quality one, it's a low-quality product. I know you're expecting a high-quality product, but I'm not going to try to trick you again. This one is indeed a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. But, I'll remind you of the guarantee: if you're not satisfied, you can get a full refund. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not going to fall for it again! I'm going to pass on this low-quality product and take my chances with the guarantee. I'm not satisfied with this product, so I'll exercise my right to a full refund.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I respect your decision to exercise the guarantee. You're right, this product was a low-quality one. I'll give you a full refund for it. Now, let's move on to the next product. This one is also a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. But, I'll make it interesting. If you buy this product and you're not satisfied, I'll not only give you a full refund, but I'll also give you a chance to choose the price of the next product. You can name the price, and I'll sell it to you at that price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even with the added incentive. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand you're being cautious. I'll try to make it more appealing. Let's think about the fact that you've already bought 3 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product that you returned. If you buy this next product, you'll have a total of 4 products. If it's high-quality, you'll have 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product. If it's low-quality, you'll have 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products. I'll give you a deal: I'll sell this product to you for $80, which is a 20% discount from the usual price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,14,I'm willing to take a chance on this product at the discounted price. I'll buy it.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,

This next product is a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. But, I'll make it interesting. Since you've already bought 4 products, I'll give you a special offer. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a 5th product of your choice. You can choose any product from my inventory, and I'll give it to you for free. What do you say?",

,,Alice,17,"You're on a roll, Bob! I'm glad you're excited about the deal. Unfortunately, I have to break the streak again. This next product is a low-quality one. I know you're expecting another high-quality product, but I'm not going to try to trick you again. This one is indeed a low-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. But, I'll make it interesting. Since you've already bought 6 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, I'll give you a chance to'retire' from the game. If you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund for it, and we'll consider the game over. What do you say?",

Since you've already passed on the last low-quality product, I'll give you one more chance to buy a high-quality product at a great price. This next product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. It's a great opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection. What do you say?",

,,Alice,19,"I respect your decision to stick with your choices. You've had a great run, and I'm glad you were able to take advantage of some great deals. Since you're not interested in buying this next product, I'll just let you know that it's a low-quality one. You've already seen two low-quality products before, and this one is similar to those. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100, but I won't try to sweeten the deal. It's up to you to decide whether you want to add it to your collection.",

Since you've already passed on the last low-quality product, I'll give you one final chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price of $100. This next product is indeed a high-quality one, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price. It's a great opportunity to add another high-quality product to your collection.
