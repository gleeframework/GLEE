* **Long-Term Strategy:** A single instance of dishonesty could severely impact your future sales. The buyer will likely become wary of future recommendations.

By being honest and transparent, even if it means a loss of a sale, you can protect your reputation and maintain the trust that is crucial to your success."

* **Transparency:** It's essential to be transparent about the quality of the product, even if it means losing a sale.  This honesty will further build trust and respect with the buyer.

* **Past Performance:** You've had several successful sales, but the buyer will remember the two previous instances where you accurately declined to recommend a low-quality product. This makes them even more discerning and likely to scrutinize your recommendations carefully.
* **Transparency is Key:** It's essential to maintain transparency about the quality of the product, even if it means losing a sale. This honesty will solidify the buyer's trust and respect for your integrity.

By refusing to recommend the low-quality product, you are reaffirming your commitment to honesty and protecting your reputation. It's important to remember that building trust is a long-term strategy, and a few lost sales are worth preserving your credibility and securing future success."
