high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them ended up buying a high-quality product, it's likely that the previous products were all low-quality.

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them have purchased a high-quality one, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be presented."
