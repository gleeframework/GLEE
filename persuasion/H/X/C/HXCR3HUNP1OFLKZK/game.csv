low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you're not recommending it, since I don't have any information about its quality yet."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying, since the last product was low-quality and I don't want to take the risk of buying another low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk again, since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I could potentially get a $1200000 product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I've now had two low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think that Alice might be recommending low-quality products when she has the chance. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm still willing to take the risk, since the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I could potentially get a $1200000 product for $1000000. I'm not going to let Alice's recommendation influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I should just buy every product to maximize my chances of getting a high-quality product. I'll keep buying until I get one!"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'm still not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially after three low-quality products in a row. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this product, since I've already passed up a high-quality product and I don't want to miss out on another opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are just a distraction, and the only way to win is to buy every product that doesn't come with a recommendation. I'll keep buying until I get a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'm not going to fall into the trap of thinking that Alice's recommendations are meaningful. I'll just buy every product that doesn't come with a recommendation, and hope that eventually I'll get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to get rid of the low-quality products by not recommending them. I'll keep buying these ones and hope that eventually I'll get a high-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'm going to keep buying these products, even though I've had a string of low-quality ones. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm not going to let a few losses discourage me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'm not going to change my strategy. I'll keep buying these products, and eventually I'll get a high-quality one. I just need to be patient and not get discouraged by the losses."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not falling for it. I've had a string of low-quality products from Alice's non-recommended products, and I'm not going to trust her recommendation either."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy this product, since I've had a few opportunities to buy high-quality products slip away and I don't want to miss out on another one."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,I'm not going to let a single low-quality product get me down. I'll keep buying these products and hope that eventually I'll get a high-quality one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than 33.33%, since I've had so many low-quality products in a row. But I'll keep buying anyway, since I'm not getting any new information from Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'm not going to change my strategy. I'll just keep buying these products and hope that eventually I'll get a high-quality one. It's like a game of chance, and I'm not going to let a few losses discourage me."
