Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more information. Since you're the fourth buyer in a row who's purchased a high-quality product, I think it's worth noting that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, as stated at the beginning. However, the fact that the last three buyers have all gotten high-quality products suggests that the distribution of high-quality products might be skewed in my favor. I'm offering this high-quality product to you for $10000, and I'm willing to provide a detailed report on the product's performance and features after the sale, so you can see for yourself its value.

I'd like to offer you a deal that takes into account the changing odds. Since the first 4 products were all high-quality, and the 5th product is also high-quality, it's likely that the distribution is still skewed towards high-quality products. However, to mitigate the risk, I'm willing to offer you a discount of $1000 off the original price of $10000. This brings the price down to $9000.
