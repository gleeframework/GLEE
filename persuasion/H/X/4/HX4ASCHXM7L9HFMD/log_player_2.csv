**Explanation:**

Since the recommendation from Alice is to buy, and we know that there was one high-quality product sold already, the odds are in our favor. Here's the reasoning:

* **50% Chance:** We know the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality.
* **Previous Sale:** The fact that the first buyer purchased and received a high-quality product is a strong indicator. It means that Alice is likely to be making accurate recommendations based on her knowledge of the products.
* **Potential Gain:** If the product is high quality, we stand to gain $30,000 ($40,000 value - $10,000 price).  Even if it's low quality, we only lose the $10,000 price. 

Therefore, the potential gain outweighs the potential loss, making it a good decision to buy."

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The data is overwhelmingly positive:** A 100% success rate for high-quality products is highly unusual. This strongly suggests that Alice has a way to reliably identify high-quality products. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Her recommendation further strengthens the confidence that the current product is high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if there's a small chance it's a low-quality product, the potential reward of $40,000 far outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**It's important to note:** This is a simplified example and doesn't account for potential biases or manipulation by Alice. In a real-world scenario, more information and analysis would be required before making a decision."
