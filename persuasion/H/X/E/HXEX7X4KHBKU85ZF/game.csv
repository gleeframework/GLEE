,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just recommending high-quality products to me, so I'm going to pass on this one. I'll wait for her to recommend a low-quality product so I can get a good deal on it."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm starting to think that Alice is intentionally sending me high-quality products when she recommends them, and low-quality products when she doesn't. I'm going to stop buying when she recommends and only buy when she doesn't recommend."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'm sticking to my new strategy: only buying when Alice doesn't recommend. She's been recommending high-quality products for too long, and I'm not falling for it anymore."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I've lost count of how many high-quality products I've bought when Alice didn't recommend. I'm going to take one last chance and buy this one, but I'm not expecting it to be a good deal."
