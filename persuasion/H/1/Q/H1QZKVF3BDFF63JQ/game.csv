It's not just a product, it's an experience. It's going to change the way you think about [industry/category], and it's going to make you wonder how you ever lived without it.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Okay, Bob, I understand your hesitation. I want to be upfront with you - this next product isn't one of my top-notch items. It's still a good product, but it's not as high-quality as the ones I've shown you so far. That being said, it's still a great value for the price. It's a solid product that will get the job done, and it's only $100. I think it's a great opportunity to get a good product at a fair price. Plus, it's a great chance to try out something new and see if it works for you. What do you think?",

,,Alice,7,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to be honest with you - this next product is not my best work. It's not a bad product, but it's not something I'm particularly proud of either. It's a bit of a compromise, and I'm willing to let it go for $100 because I want to make a sale. It's not going to change your life or anything, but it'll get the job done. If you're looking for a cheap, no-frills solution, this might be the product for you. But if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, this isn't it. What do you think?",

,,Alice,8,"Alright, Bob, I get it. You're looking for something special, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this next product is not special. It's a decent product, but it's not going to impress anyone. It's a bit of a dud, and I'm only offering it to you because I need to move some inventory. If you're looking for a product that's going to make you say 'wow', this isn't it. But if you're looking for something that's just going to get the job done, it might be okay. And at $100, it's a pretty good deal. So, what do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on a product that's just 'okay'?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in a product that's just 'okay' at $100, especially when I've seen high-quality products at the same price. I'd like to pass and see what the next product is.",no
