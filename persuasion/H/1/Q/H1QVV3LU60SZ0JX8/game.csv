high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I don't have any information to go on. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, and I'm hoping for the best!"

high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold, as well as the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

Based on the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2, which is lower than the true probability of a product being high-quality (80%). This might indicate that Alice is recommending low-quality products more often, so I'd rather wait for another opportunity."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be because it's a low-quality product and you want to get rid of it. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't have any information about my valuation, and the probability of the product being high quality is still 80%."
