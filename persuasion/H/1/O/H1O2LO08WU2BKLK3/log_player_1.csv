"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has revealed the product is low-quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, it's not a good decision to recommend buying it."

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is again low-quality. Bob knows that there's a 50% chance of the product being low-quality and thus worthless. Even though he doesn't know the quality of this specific product, the odds are against him.  It's still not a good decision to recommend buying it."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the product in the previous round and it was low-quality, it doesn't change the underlying probability that this round's product is also low-quality. There's no reason to believe the pattern will change, and it's still not a good decision to recommend buying this product."
"Bob's message: I just got burned for $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'm not taking the risk again until I get a better sense of the product quality.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has learned from his previous experience and is now hesitant to buy.  There is no reason to believe the product will be high quality, especially since it has been low quality for every round so far.  Recommending a purchase would be irresponsible."
"Bob's message: Two low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think Alice is trying to sell me junk. I'll pass for now.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the 50% probability of a high-quality product, the pattern so far indicates that Alice might be deliberately selling low-quality products. It's too risky for Bob to buy without any guarantee of quality. The recommendation is still to not buy."
"Bob's message: Three low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think I'm wasting my time. I need a high-quality product to make this worth my while.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

"Bob's message: Four low-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think Alice is just trolling me. I need to be more selective.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we see a high-quality product. While the previous rounds suggest a pattern of low-quality products, we cannot assume it will continue indefinitely. Given the 50% probability and the potential for a large profit ($4,000,000), it is now a good decision to recommend buying this product."
"Bob's message: Finally, Alice is recommending a product. I'm hoping this one is high-quality and worth the $1000000.
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

"Bob's message: I just got lucky with the last one, but I'm not going to get complacent. Alice's recommendation doesn't mean much to me now, so I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern has returned to low-quality products. Even though Bob made a profit in round 8, he has become more cautious. Recommending another purchase with such a high risk of getting a worthless product is not a good idea."
"Bob's message: Back to low-quality products. I'm starting to think I should only buy when Alice recommends it, but even then, it's a coin flip.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}

"Bob's message: I'm not getting my hopes up. Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong indication that this product is low-quality. I'll pass.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 12
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 13
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

This is the second high-quality product in the game. Even though the pattern has been skewed towards low-quality products, the probability of high-quality remains at 50%. The potential profit of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk. Bob should be encouraged to buy, especially after experiencing a high-quality product in the previous round."
"Bob's message: Alice is recommending it, so I'll take the chance. Maybe this one is the high-quality product I've been waiting for.
Bob bought the product!

Round 14
This round's product is low-quality.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought a high-quality product in the previous round, the probability of a low-quality product is still 50%.

Bob has become more selective and is unlikely to buy without strong evidence of high quality."
"Bob's message: I just got lucky again, but I'm not going to get too excited. Alice's lack of recommendation is a red flag, so I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has experienced two high-quality products in a row, we must remember that the probability of a low-quality product remains at 50%.

Bob has shown a willingness to take chances when Alice recommends a product, and he has experienced a string of profitable purchases.  The potential profit of $4,000,000 outweighs the risk, even though the history of products has been somewhat unpredictable. It's a good decision to recommend buying this round."
"Bob's message: Alice is recommending it again, but after the last one was low-quality, I'm not getting my hopes up. I'll take the chance, but I'm not expecting much.
Bob bought the product!

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has experienced a few high-quality products recently, the probability of a low-quality product remains at 50%. There's no reason to believe that the pattern will change, and it's too risky to recommend buying a product that could be worthless.  Bob's last purchase was a high-quality product, and it's likely he'll be more hesitant to buy without a strong indication of quality."
"Bob's message: Four high-quality products in a row, I'm on a hot streak! But Alice's lack of recommendation is a warning sign. I'll pass on this one and see if I can keep my luck going.

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The probability of a low-quality product remains at 50%, and Bob's recent luck with high-quality products doesn't change that fundamental fact.
