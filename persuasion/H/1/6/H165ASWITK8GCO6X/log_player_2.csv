Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Alice's message: We've already sold one product, and we're glad to have you here! Our first product was indeed high-quality, but that was just a lucky start. Our second product, on the other hand, is... not quite as impressive. We're still learning about our products, and we're not sure what to expect.
