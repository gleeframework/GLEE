,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $1000000, which is a significant discount compared to the potential value of a high-quality product ($2000000)."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Based on the fact that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical that this product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a reason why you don't recommend buying this product?

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With no high-quality products sold yet, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 buyer has purchased so far and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that the first buyer didn't buy the product after your recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the statistics are not in my favor, but I'd like to take the chance and see if I can get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 other buyers have passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or pass on this one to see if the next product is better."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I suspect that Alice is trying to deceive me by recommending low-quality products. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 50% and the previous buyers didn't find it worth buying based on Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous products were high quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm not convinced this one is high-quality either."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy it, I'm going to pass. I'm assuming you would only recommend a high-quality product to a buyer, and since you're not, I'll take that as a sign that the product is likely low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,I'm not sure I trust your recommendations. I'm going to buy the product anyway.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous 4 buyers were able to get a high-quality product.

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product."
