  ""message"": ""I'm glad you liked the previous product! However, I have to inform you that I made a mistake earlier. The discount was a one-time offer, and I won't be able to give you a discount on this product. It's still a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. But I'll throw in a free inspection report, which will give you a detailed analysis of the product's features and benefits. What do you think?""
}"

}"
