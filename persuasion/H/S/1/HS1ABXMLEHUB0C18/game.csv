,,Alice,3,"I revealed the quality of the next product, and it's a low-quality product. However, this current product is high-quality. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product before the next round. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the quality of the next product secret.

,,Alice,4,"You just got a high-quality product for $900000, which is worth $1200000 to you. This current product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're being cautious, and I respect that. Since you're not willing to buy this high-quality product for $950000, I'll offer you a deal that's a bit more flexible. If you buy this product, I'll reveal the quality of the next two products before the next round. You'll get to see if the next product is high-quality or low-quality, and then you'll get to see the quality of the product after that. This way, you'll have more information to make a decision about the current product.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're looking for a fair price for the current product.

,,Alice,7,"You're looking for a high-quality product at a good price. Given that you were willing to pay $900000 for a high-quality product earlier, and considering the current market dynamics, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1050000. This price is a bit higher than the previous offer, but I believe it's still a good value considering the product's quality and the fact that you've already seen a low-quality product for a significantly lower price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're holding out for a better deal. I understand that the previous offer was a bit steep. Considering the low-quality product from the previous round, which you passed on for $300000, I'm willing to offer you this low-quality product for $200000. This is a significant discount from the previous offer, and it's a good opportunity to get a low-quality product at a very low price.",

Given that you've seen two low-quality products and one high-quality product, and considering the exclusive offer I made earlier, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $950000.
