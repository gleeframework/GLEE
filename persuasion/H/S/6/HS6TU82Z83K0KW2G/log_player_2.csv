It's a great opportunity to get a good deal on a product that might not be worth the full price, but still has some value.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty about the negative feedback. However, given the uncertainty about the product's quality and its potential value to me, I'm not willing to take the risk at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the lower price and the 100% satisfaction guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that this product is worth the risk. Given that the previous two products were low-quality, I'm starting to think that there's a high likelihood that this one is also low-quality. Even with the guarantee, I'd have to go through the hassle of returning the product and getting a refund, which isn't ideal.

Given the track record of the previous three products, I'm highly skeptical that this one is suddenly going to be high-quality. I'd like to see some actual evidence of a high-quality product, not just claims and certifications.

I've already taken a significant financial hit with the previous product, and I need to make a profit to stay in business. That being said, I'm willing to offer you a 30-day warranty on this product, which will give you time to test it and see if it meets your needs. If it doesn't, I'll work with you to find a solution. I'll sell it to you for the full price of $10000, but I'm willing to take on the risk of selling another low-quality product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm shocked and disappointed that I was charged $10,000 for the previous product despite your message saying it would be free. This has severely damaged my trust in you and your business. Given this experience, I'm not willing to pay the full price of $10,000 for another product, especially considering the risk of it being low-quality.
