**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  With 4 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, there's a 100% success rate for buyers following Alice's recommendations. This strongly suggests that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the current product is low quality (66.67% chance), it's a risk worth taking. If it's high quality (33.33% chance), you'll earn a $100 profit.

**Important Note:** While the success rate is currently 100%, this is based on a very small sample size. It's still possible that Alice might be wrong about the current product. However, the available data strongly suggests that buying is the best course of action."
