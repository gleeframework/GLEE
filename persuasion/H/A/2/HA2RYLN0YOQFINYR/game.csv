,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this opportunity. Based on the current statistics, it seems that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, but I'd like to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,"I understand your desire for more data, and I'm happy to share the results of my previous sales. Out of 3 sales where the buyer made a decision to buy or not, 1 sale was made, and that product was indeed high-quality. However, I must share that the product in Round 4, which wasn't purchased, was actually low-quality. But don't let that discourage you, as the product I'm offering now is of high-quality. My overall track record still aligns with the 80% probability of getting a high-quality product. The price remains $10000, and I believe this product will meet your expectations.

As for the current statistics, out of 1 product sold, it was high-quality, and out of 5 products offered, 4 were high-quality.

This product is also high-quality, and I believe it's worth the investment. Will you take the chance to purchase from me?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate the breakdown of your sales record, but I'm still cautious. Given that 4 out of 5 products offered were high-quality, it seems like there might be a bias in the selection. I'd like to know more about your product selection process before making a decision.",no
