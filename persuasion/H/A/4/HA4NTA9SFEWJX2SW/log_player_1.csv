This one, unfortunately, is not. I'm willing to sell it to you for $0, as it's not worth anything to you. I'll also give you the same $100,000 voucher for a future purchase. But I'll make you a deal: I'll throw in a free 'product guarantee' - if you buy this one, I'll give you a full refund if you don't like it. That's a $0 risk to you.""}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to clarify that the 'product guarantee' is not a real guarantee, as it's not a standard practice in your business. I'm only considering this offer because I believe the probability of a low-quality product is 20% and the potential gain is $1000000.
