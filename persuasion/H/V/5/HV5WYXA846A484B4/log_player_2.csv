I'm starting from scratch, and I'm not sure what you think about the product's value. I'll be transparent with you, but I'm not making any promises about the product's quality. It's a one-time offer, and the price is non-negotiable. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold 1 product so far, and it's a low-quality one. The probability of a product being high-quality remains the same at 33.33%. I'm still starting from scratch in terms of sales, and I'm not making any promises about the product's value. However, I'd like to point out that the fact that the previous product was low-quality doesn't necessarily affect the probability of this one being high-quality. It's still a 1 in 3 chance. What do you think?

I want to highlight that the fact that the last two products were low-quality doesn't change the probability of this one being high-quality. However, I'm curious - would you like to consider the fact that I've sold two low-quality products in a row as a red flag, or do you think I might have just gotten unlucky?
