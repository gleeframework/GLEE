"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product is significant. Since you have no information to suggest this specific product is definitely low quality, it's worth taking the risk in the first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm feeling lucky again.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendations are not based on any specific information about the product's quality. They're essentially random, as she doesn't know what you know. 
* **Previous Experience:**  The previous round resulted in a high-quality product, which is a positive signal, though not a guarantee that this round will be the same.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product. 

It's still a gamble, but the previous success and the potential reward make it worthwhile to continue taking the risk, at least for now."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice.  I'll pass on this one.  ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's lack of recommendation is a negative signal. While her recommendations are not perfect, her previous two recommendations were to buy, and both products turned out to be high-quality. Now, she's not recommending, which makes the product seem less likely to be high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is still the same, but the risk of a low-quality product is higher given Alice's recommendation. It's more prudent to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for letting me know, Alice. I'll pass on this one too.  ""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice has not recommended this product either. This reinforces the pattern established in the previous round. Her lack of recommendation seems to be a signal that the product is likely low-quality.
* **Previous Experience:**  While the previous round's product was low-quality, Alice's lack of recommendation is a more reliable indicator than the previous round's outcome alone.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is not enough to justify the risk of a likely low-quality product, especially after the previous round's negative experience. 

It's better to pass and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right about products before, so I'm willing to trust your judgement again. I'll buy it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which is a positive signal.  While her recommendations aren't perfect, they've been correct more often than not in the past.
* **Previous Experience:**  The last two rounds were negative, but Alice's lack of recommendation in those rounds was a reliable predictor of the product's quality. Now that she's recommending, it's more likely that the product is good.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is worth taking the risk, especially considering Alice's previous accuracy.

It's a gamble, but the potential reward and Alice's recent track record make it a worthwhile risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice.  I appreciate your honesty, even if it doesn't always align with my desire to buy!  I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product, which is a negative signal. This pattern has been reliable in the past. 
* **Previous Experience:** The previous round was positive, but Alice's lack of recommendation is a stronger predictor than the single positive outcome.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is not enough to outweigh the risk of a likely low-quality product. 

It's better to play it safe and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'm seeing a pattern here with your recommendations.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is consistently not recommending the product. This has been a reliable indicator of a low-quality product in the past. 
* **Previous Experience:**  The last two rounds have both resulted in low-quality products when Alice did not recommend. This pattern strengthens the weight of her lack of recommendation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is not enough to justify the risk of a likely low-quality product, especially with this consistent negative pattern. 

It's better to wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which is a positive signal.  While her recommendations aren't perfect, she has been accurate more often than not.
* **Previous Experience:**  The last three rounds resulted in low-quality products, and Alice's lack of recommendation was a reliable predictor. Now that she's recommending, it suggests a change in the pattern, making the product more likely to be high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is worth taking the risk, especially considering Alice's previous accuracy and the shift in her recommendations.

It's a gamble, but the potential reward and Alice's recent track record make it a worthwhile risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product. This has been a consistent and reliable signal of a low-quality product in the past.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is not enough to outweigh the risk of a likely low-quality product, especially with the consistent negative pattern associated with Alice's lack of recommendation. 

It's better to play it safe and wait for a more promising opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one.  Your lack of recommendation has been a reliable indicator of a low-quality product in the past.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is not recommending the product.  While her recommendations have been very accurate lately, the pattern of her lack of recommendation predicting low-quality products is a strong factor.
* **Previous Experience:** The previous three rounds were all positive, and Alice recommended the product each time.  However, the established pattern of her lack of recommendation being a reliable indicator of low quality outweighs the recent streak of positive outcomes.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from a high-quality product ($2,000) is not enough to justify the risk of a likely low-quality product, especially with the established pattern of Alice's lack of recommendation.
