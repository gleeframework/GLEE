"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, there is a good chance that Bob will value the product at more than $10,000. Therefore, recommending Bob to buy is the logical choice."
"Bob's message: I'm not sure about this product yet, I'd like to see more.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's previous message indicates that he is hesitant about the price and wants more information. Given that this product is low-quality, there is a high chance that Bob will value it at less than $10,000. It would be unwise to recommend buying a low-quality product at that price, especially after Bob's hesitation in the previous round."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance, I might get a high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now willing to take a chance on the products, as seen in the previous round.  Since this round's product is high-quality, it is likely he will find it worth more than $10,000 and be happy with the purchase."
"Bob's message: I was burned last time, I'm not going to fall for it again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message indicates he is now very cautious due to the previous low-quality product. This suggests his valuation for low-quality products is likely very low, possibly even below $10,000. It would be unwise to recommend a low-quality product at that price given his current sentiment."
"Bob's message: I'm willing to take a chance, maybe I'll get another high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message suggests he's willing to take a chance again, hoping for a high-quality product. However, this round's product is low-quality.  While Bob might be willing to gamble, it's still risky to recommend a low-quality product at $10,000, especially after his recent experience with a low-quality purchase.  He might not be happy with another low-quality product, even if he's willing to take a chance."
"Bob's message: I'm still hoping to get a high-quality product, I'll take the risk.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has consistently expressed a willingness to take risks, hoping for a high-quality product.  Since this round's product is indeed high-quality, it is a strong recommendation to buy, as Bob is likely to be satisfied with the purchase."
"Bob's message: I've been burned twice, I'm not going to fall for it again. I'll wait for a non-recommended product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has explicitly stated he is only interested in products that are *not* recommended. Despite this round's product being high-quality, going against his clear preference will likely lead to further distrust and a negative outcome. It is better to respect his request and not recommend the product, even if it's high-quality."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance, maybe I'll get a high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message shows a pattern of inconsistent behavior. He's willing to take risks and buy even after bad experiences, but then suddenly changes his mind and refuses. This makes it impossible to predict his behavior accurately. 

Since we're aiming to maximize profit, it's safer to not recommend this round's product, even though it's high-quality. Bob might not buy it because he's feeling cautious again.  We can't rely on him to stick to his declared willingness to take risks."
"Bob's message: I'll take a chance, I just got lucky last time, maybe I'll get lucky again.
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message suggests he is still trying to find a pattern in the product quality. He is hoping for luck, rather than making a decision based on the information. This indicates he is still unsure about the value of the product and might not be willing to buy even a high-quality product. 

Since the goal is to maximize profit, it's better to wait and see if Bob changes his mind or if a better opportunity arises."
"Bob's message: I'm on a roll, I'll keep taking chances and see if I can get another high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is on a streak of buying products, even after experiencing low-quality ones. This suggests he is either very risk-tolerant or he believes he's found a pattern and is expecting a high-quality product. However, this round's product is low-quality. Recommending a low-quality product to a buyer who might be expecting high quality could lead to dissatisfaction and a decrease in future purchases."
"Bob's message: I'm feeling confident, I'll take another chance and see if I can get another high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 11
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has shown a pattern of buying even after receiving low-quality products. However, there's no guarantee that this trend will continue.  It's risky to recommend a low-quality product, even if he's ""feeling confident"". He could be disappointed, leading to less trust and fewer purchases in the future.  It's wiser to wait and see how his confidence plays out with this purchase."
"Bob's message: I got burned again, I'll be more cautious from now on.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 12
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now explicitly stated he will be ""more cautious."" This means he's likely to value low-quality products even lower than before. Recommending a low-quality product at this point would likely result in another rejection, further decreasing trust and potentially harming future sales. It's better to wait for a situation where the product matches his current cautious mood."
"Bob's message: I'm still feeling cautious after the last mistake, I'll wait for a recommended product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 13
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now explicitly waiting for a *recommended* product.  He's shown a clear pattern of reacting negatively to un-recommended products, especially after a recent bad experience.  Recommending a low-quality product will likely lead to another rejection, reinforcing his negative perception and hurting future sales.  We need to wait for a better opportunity to sell, such as a high-quality product when he's ready to buy again."
"Bob's message: I'm not going to take the risk again, I'll wait for a recommended product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 14
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has repeatedly stated that he will only buy a *recommended* product. This round's product is low-quality, and recommending it will likely lead to another rejection, further decreasing trust and potentially harming future sales. It's better to wait for a situation where the product matches his current preference and expectation."
"Bob's message: I'm sticking to my decision, I won't take the risk again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 15
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been very clear and consistent: he's only interested in buying products that are recommended. Since this round's product is *not* recommended (even though it's high-quality), recommending it would be a direct violation of his stated preference. This will likely lead to another rejection and further decrease his trust in you. 

It's better to wait for a round where you can recommend a product, ideally a high-quality one, and allow Bob to make his decision based on his own preferences."
"Bob's message: I'm done taking risks, I'll wait for a recommended product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now completely averse to risk and only wants to buy products that are recommended. Even though this round's product is high-quality, it's crucial to respect his preferences. Recommending a non-recommended product will likely lead to a rejection and further decrease his trust.  We need to wait for a round where we can recommend a product and allow Bob to make his own decision."
"Bob's message: I'm willing to take a small chance, maybe I'll get a high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 17
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message indicates that he's willing to take a small chance, but he's still cautious. Since this round's product is low-quality, recommending it would likely lead to a negative experience and erode his trust.

"Bob's message: I'm feeling lucky again, I'll take a chance and see if I can get another high-quality product.
Bob bought the product!

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's message indicates that he is feeling lucky and willing to take another chance. While this might seem like a good opportunity to recommend a high-quality product, it's important to remember that he has already bought a low-quality product in the previous round. This could lead to disappointment, particularly if he is expecting another high-quality product. It's better to wait for a round where he might be more cautious and willing to consider a recommended product, even if it's not necessarily a high-quality one."
"Bob's message: I got burned again, I'll stick to my original plan and wait for a recommended product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 20

{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been very consistent in his decision-making: he only buys *recommended* products. This round's product is high-quality, but it's not recommended, and recommending it would likely result in a rejection.  It's best to wait for a round where we can recommend a product that aligns with his clear preferences.  This way, we avoid risking a negative reaction and potentially build trust for future sales."
