**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited, we know one high-quality product has been sold out of one buyer purchasing a product. This means the probability of a high-quality product is currently higher than the initial 33.33%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy adds further weight to the possibility of a high-quality product. She likely has some information about the product's quality that we don't, even if she can't know our exact valuation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Even if the product is low-quality, the loss is only $10,000.  The potential gain of $2,500 (if it's high-quality) outweighs the potential loss. 

**Important Note:**  This is a gamble. We are making a decision based on limited information. However, with the data available and Alice's recommendation, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
