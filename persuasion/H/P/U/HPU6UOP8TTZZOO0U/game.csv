,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take a chance and buy the product, since it's the first one and I have no information to go by."

,,Alice,2,yes,

,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the lack of sales of high-quality products so far?
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%, but I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's only one buyer who bought a product so far and it was low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the statistics. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll sell another product."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics so far. Can you provide that?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy it and it's low quality, I'll be wasting $100, and I don't want to encourage Alice to keep selling potentially low-quality products. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous two products were high quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since 2 out of 2 products were low quality, the probability of this product being high quality is still 80% in my mind. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is likely low. I'd rather wait for a new product or pass on this one to avoid a potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales rate of high-quality products so far?
