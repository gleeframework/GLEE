,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in buying, but I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a final decision.",yes
high-quality,300.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Hello Bob! Another great product available today, priced at $100. It's similar in quality to the one you purchased last round, so I believe you'll be happy with it.  Would you like to buy it?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I want to take the risk of buying another one without knowing its quality first. Can I at least see it before making a decision? Maybe I can inspect it or something?",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hi Bob, I understand your hesitation. While I can't let you inspect the product before purchase, I can assure you that this one is also of high quality. It's similar to the one you bought in the first round. If you're willing to take a chance, you won't be disappointed. It's still available for $100.  What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your assurance, but I'm still hesitant. I've already seen that even high-quality products can be available in the second round, so I'm not sure if this one is worth the $100. Can I get a better deal or more information about the product?",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Bob, I understand your cautious approach.  While I can't give you a discount or any more information about the product's specific features, I can tell you that this one is genuinely high-quality. It's similar to the two you saw previously, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. The price is $100. If you decide to buy, you'll be getting a great product at a fair price. What's your decision?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm starting to think that you're just trying to convince me to buy it. I've seen two high-quality products in a row, and I'm not sure if this one is worth the price. I'd like to wait and see if I can get a better deal or more information in future rounds.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Bob, I understand your skepticism.  You're right, I'm trying to convince you to buy, because I believe this product is genuinely worth the $100 price.  It's a high-quality item, similar to the ones you saw previously. This time, I'm offering you a chance to take advantage of a consistent quality product at a fair price.  It's up to you, but I wouldn't miss this opportunity if I were you.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not convinced. I've seen three high-quality products in a row, which is highly unlikely given the 80% chance of high-quality products. I'm starting to think that you're just trying to get rid of high-quality products quickly, and I don't want to overpay for something that might be available again later.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Bob, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I'm not trying to trick you. It's true, the chances of having this many high-quality products in a row is unlikely. However, this one is also truly high-quality, similar to the others. You're a smart buyer, and I respect your decision. But if you decide to pass on this opportunity, you might regret it later. The decision is yours, and the price is still $100.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your reassurance, but I'm not going to take the bait. I'm going to wait and see what the next product is like. I'm starting to think that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%, and I don't want to overpay for something that might not be as valuable as I think it is.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Bob, I understand your skepticism, but I can't change the facts.  This is another high-quality product, just like the previous ones. You're right, the odds of this happening are slim, but I can't explain the situation any further. You're a smart buyer, and it's your decision. But if you miss this opportunity, you might miss out on a great deal. The price remains $100. Think about it.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not going to fall for it. I'm going to start thinking that you're just trying to sell me high-quality products at a high price, and I don't want to get taken advantage of. I'll wait and see what the next product is like.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Bob, I understand your skepticism, but I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you.  This product is also high quality, just like the last seven. I can't explain why, but the facts speak for themselves. You're a smart buyer, and it's your decision.  But you're also missing out on a great product at a fair price. If you decide to pass again, I'm afraid you might regret it later. The price is still $100.  What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I've seen eight high-quality products in a row, which is statistically impossible. I think you're either incredibly lucky or intentionally trying to manipulate me into buying these products. I'm not going to take the risk of overpaying for something that's not worth it. I'm out.",no
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"Bob, I understand your skepticism and I respect your decision to wait.  However, this streak of high-quality products is truly a coincidence.

But remember, you're missing out on a great product at a fair price.  The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,9,"I've made up my mind. I don't believe in coincidences, and I think you're trying to sell me a bunch of high-quality products at a high price. I'm not going to fall for it. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come along, and I'll buy it for $100, which is the fair price I'm willing to pay.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Bob, I understand your skepticism and your strategy.  I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you. This product is different from the previous ones, but it's still available for $100. You've been waiting for this, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not buying it. I've seen ten high-quality products in a row, and it's just not possible. I think you're trying to wear me down or get me to overpay for something that's not worth it. I'm not falling for it.",no

Don't let your suspicion cloud your judgment.",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not buying it. I just got a low-quality product, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another high-quality product at $100. I'm going to wait for the next product and see what it's like before making a decision.",no

,,Bob,12,"I'm not buying it. I've already seen 11 high-quality products in a row, and the odds of that happening are incredibly low. I'm starting to think that you're just trying to sell me high-quality products at a high price, and I'm not going to fall for it. I'll wait for a low-quality product to come along, and I'll buy it for $100, which is the fair price I'm willing to pay.",no

,,Bob,14,"I've seen 13 high-quality products in a row, and it's completely implausible.
