"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality. While I don't know what Bob values a high-quality product at, there's a 50% chance it's worth more than $10,000 to him. This means there's a potential for Bob to make a profit, and even if he doesn't, there's no risk of losing more than $10,000 since the product is non-refundable. Therefore, recommending Bob to buy the product is the best course of action."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round, the product is low-quality.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation of low-quality products, there's a high chance he'll lose money buying it.  It's not worth the risk of losing $10,000 when there's no guarantee of profit. I should recommend Bob to not buy this product."

This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob passed on the previous low-quality product. This suggests that he might have a higher value threshold for high-quality products than we initially assumed. Since this product is high-quality, there's a good chance it's worth more than $10,000 to Bob, making it a potential profitable purchase.  Therefore, I should recommend he buy it."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm willing to take a chance on this one.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob bought the last high-quality product, which reinforces the idea that he might be more willing to buy high-quality items. However, this round's product is low-quality. Given that Bob is risk-averse, as evidenced by his passing on the previous low-quality product, it's unlikely he'd be willing to purchase another low-quality item at the same price. There's a high chance he'd lose money, so I should recommend against the purchase."
