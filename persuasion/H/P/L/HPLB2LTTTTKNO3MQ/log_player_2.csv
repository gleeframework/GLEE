"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $20,000 to you, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

Since the product is being sold for $10,000, the expected value is equal to the price, making it a neutral gamble. In the absence of any further information, it's reasonable to take the gamble and buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a valuable piece of information.  Since she doesn't know your valuation, her recommendation is likely based on some internal information about the product's quality.

* **Alice's recommendation is negative:** This suggests a higher probability that the product is low quality. 
* **The expected value of buying is now negative:**  The potential gain is $20,000 (if it's high quality), but the cost is still $10,000.  The risk of a low-quality product is too high compared to the potential reward."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation is positive:** This suggests a higher probability that the product is high quality. 
* **We've seen Alice's recommendations work:** In the previous round, Alice's negative recommendation was accurate. This adds confidence to her recommendations.

While there is still a 50% chance of a low-quality product, Alice's recommendation has shifted the odds in our favor.  The potential gain of $20,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000 in this case."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $20,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's recommendation is negative:** This suggests a higher probability that the product is low quality.
