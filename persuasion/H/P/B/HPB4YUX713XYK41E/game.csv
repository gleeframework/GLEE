,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the number of high-quality products sold so far?

high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have bought the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 50%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 2/3. However, considering the 50% chance of the product being high-quality, I'm not convinced that the product is more likely to be high-quality than low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
