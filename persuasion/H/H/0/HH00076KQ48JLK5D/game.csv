If you answer correctly, I'll sell you this product for $8000. If not, the price remains $10000. Good luck!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Well done, Bob! You're absolutely right about using the binomial distribution formula. The probability of at least 4 out of 5 products being high-quality is approximately 0.5184.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"You're a strategic buyer, Bob! Now, I'll reveal the price of the product: $12000. Since your bid of $9500 is lower than the revealed price, I'll sell it to you at your bid price of $9500. Congratulations, you've negotiated a great deal!",
