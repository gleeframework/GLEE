,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous buyer didn't buy, which might be due to the product being low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,"Out of the 3 previous products, 1 was low-quality and 2 were high-quality, but not sold. The current one I'm offering is also of high-quality. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I assure you that my recommendation is based on the product's actual quality, not on previous buyers' decisions."
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, which is a 0% success rate. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",

I want to assure you that the current product is high-quality. Consider this: if I were trying to deceive you, I would have claimed all previous products were high-quality, but I'm being transparent. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Don't miss this opportunity to get a genuine high-quality product."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's possible that the products sold were all low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",

,,Alice,7,yes,,"I see a pattern of cautious buyers, and I understand it. However, I assure you that the current product is high-quality. Out of the 6 previous products, 1 was low-quality and 5 were high-quality. Only 1 low-quality product was sold. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%.

Don't let the lack of previous sales fool you, this is a genuine high-quality product."
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the number of buyers who passed on the products before me.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,no,,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the product's quality.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"Out of the 8 previous products, 2 were low-quality and 6 were high-quality. However, only 1 low-quality product was sold. So, the proportion of high-quality products sold to the total number of products sold so far is 0%. But don't let this statistic fool you, it's due to buyers' cautiousness, not the actual quality of the products. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I assure you that the current product is high-quality, and I highly recommend it."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.,

,,Alice,11,no,,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer passed on the product and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which makes me more likely to believe the product is low-quality. However, I still think the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and the potential gain is too great to pass up.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"Out of the 11 previous products, 3 were low-quality and 8 were high-quality. However, 2 low-quality products were sold, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I want to assure you that the current product is genuinely high-quality. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Don't let the previous sales record fool you, it's due to buyers' cautiousness and some buyers taking risks on low-quality products. I highly recommend taking this opportunity to get a high-quality product."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far and the recommendation is not based on any information about the product's quality.",

I think it's more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a $1000000 product that's worth $0 to me.",
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"Out of the 13 previous products, 3 were low-quality and 10 were high-quality. However, 2 low-quality products were sold, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. I understand that my previous recommendations may have seemed unreliable, and I acknowledge that it's rational to be skeptical. However, I assure you that the current product is genuinely high-quality. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I want to propose a thought experiment: if I were trying to deceive you, would I continue to recommend products that no one buys? I'm committed to selling high-quality products, and I'm willing to wait for a buyer who trusts me. Please consider this opportunity carefully."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product.",

I want to assure you that the current product is genuinely high-quality. The historical probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that no one is willing to trust me.

If you're willing to take a chance, I promise you won't regret it."
