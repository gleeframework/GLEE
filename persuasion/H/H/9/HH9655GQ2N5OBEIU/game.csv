,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a deal on a product that I think you'll really like. It's a one-time opportunity to get a great value for $10000. If you're interested, I'll give you a special 'guarantee' that I'll offer you a second product at the same price as the first one if you buy this one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in the guarantee, I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in waiting to see the quality of the product. Now that you've seen that the first product was low-quality, I'm willing to offer you a 'honesty bonus'. If you buy this high-quality product, I'll give you a 5% discount, making the price $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only offering it because I want to make sure you're confident in your purchase.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by the 'honesty bonus' and I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism about the 'honesty bonus'. Let me try a different approach. I'll give you a straightforward statement about the product: I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000, but I'm also willing to give you a refund if you return it within 24 hours. This way, you can try it out and see if it's something you're interested in, with no risk.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product, but I'll only pay $9500 with the 5% discount you offered in the previous round.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! Considering you were willing to pay $9500 for a low-quality product in the previous round, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell this high-quality product to you for $9500. It's a great value, and I think you'll really appreciate the quality of this product.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not willing to pay $9500 for a high-quality product when I just got a low-quality product for the same price. I'll wait and see what happens next.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the price. Let me make a comparison for you: if you buy this low-quality product for $10000, you'll have paid the same price as the previous low-quality product, but you'll have the opportunity to try out two low-quality products and see if you can spot any differences between them. If you're interested in that, I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $500.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, and the free accessory isn't enough to sway my decision. I'll wait and see what happens next.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm not giving up on you yet! I've been thinking about our previous conversation, and I realize that I didn't provide you with enough information to make a decision. Let me change that. I'll give you a detailed description of the features and benefits of this high-quality product, and I'll also provide you with some customer testimonials and reviews from satisfied customers who have purchased this product. If you're still not convinced, I'll throw in a 30-day money-back guarantee. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to consider the high-quality product now that you're providing more information and a guarantee. I'll take the product, but I still want to negotiate the price. Can you meet me at $10500?",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $10500, as that's above the original price of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell this high-quality product to you for $10250, which is a 2.5% discount from the original price. I think this is a fair offer considering the value you'll get from the product.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not willing to pay $10250 for the high-quality product. I think the original price of $10000 was already a good deal, and I'm not willing to pay an additional 2.5% just for the sake of a discount. I'll pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to point out that you've already paid $9500 for a low-quality product in a previous round, and now you're passing on a high-quality product for only $250 more. I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. It's a great value, and you'll be getting a second low-quality product at a significantly lower price than the first one.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in buying another low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'd rather wait and see what happens next.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm not giving up on you yet! I've noticed that you've been willing to pay $9500 for a low-quality product in the past, and you're now passing on a high-quality product for a relatively small premium. I'm willing to make a bold offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9500, the same price you paid for the low-quality product. It's a risk-free opportunity to upgrade to a high-quality product, and I think you won't regret it.",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the high-quality product for $9500. I'm willing to take the risk and upgrade from a low-quality product to a high-quality one at the same price.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're taking the leap and upgrading to a high-quality product! Considering you've already paid $9500 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer you a loyalty discount on this next high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a 10% discount from the original price. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at an even better value.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not interested in buying another high-quality product at this point. I'm happy with the one I just purchased and don't want to take on any more risk.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I completely understand your decision to hold back on buying another high-quality product. However, I want to make one final offer to you. Since you've already bought one high-quality product and passed on this one, I'll give you the opportunity to buy this high-quality product for $9500, which is the same price you paid for the previous high-quality product. If you don't like it, you can always return it and we can part ways. But if you do like it, you'll get another great product at a price that's hard to beat.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're feeling optimistic about getting a good deal! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold you two high-quality products, and now I'm offering you a low-quality product. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I want to make sure you're aware of what you're getting. That being said, I'll give you a very straightforward offer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $8000, which is a 20% discount from the original price. It's a great value, and you can still get a good deal on a product that might not be perfect, but will still serve its purpose.",

I'm willing to make one final offer to you: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $7500, which is a 25% discount from the original price. It's a very good deal, and I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a better value elsewhere. If you're still not interested, I'll be done offering you products.",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a 25% discount. I've had two chances to buy high-quality products and passed on them, and I'm not willing to take a risk on a low-quality product now.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your decision to prioritize caution, and I respect your risk-averse approach. However, I want to give you one last chance to consider a high-quality product. Since you've already passed on this opportunity once, I'll make a special offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product for $9000, which is the same price as the high-quality product you bought in Round 10. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with this product. If you're still not interested, I'll be done offering you products.",
