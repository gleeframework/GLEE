Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though this product is high-quality, there's no reason to believe the buyer would be willing to pay $100 for it.  Here's why:

* **No Information:** The buyer has no information about the product's value to them.  They know the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, but that's it.
* **Previous Buyer's Action:**  The previous buyer's decision to pass reinforces the idea that there's a risk associated with purchasing. The buyer is likely to wait and see if others buy and what their experience is. 
* **No Incentive:**  There's no reason for the buyer to be the first to take a risk, especially with no guarantee of a positive outcome.

Until the buyer has more information about the product's value or sees evidence of other buyers' satisfaction, they're unlikely to purchase."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there's no prior data and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now.

* **No Information:** The buyer still has no information about the product's specific value to them. 
* **No Prior Sales:** There's no record of previous sales to provide any data points about the product's quality.
* **Buyer's Hesitation:** The buyer's continued hesitation, despite the high-quality product this round, shows their unwillingness to be the first to purchase without more information.

Until there's some indication that the product is worth $100 to the buyer, recommending the purchase is unlikely to be successful."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. Since there is no sales history yet and you don't recommend the product, I'll pass for now.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
