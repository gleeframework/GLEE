,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product. What was the probability that they bought a high-quality product based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? I've seen the statistics, and there's only been 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, so I'm not sure if that's representative of the overall quality of the products."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold, before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00% and it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm willing to take the risk.

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that only 1 out of 3 previous buyers bought the product recommended by Alice. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, and Alice has recommended a product to me, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the recommendation is biased based on the previous sales record. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the 80% probability of a high-quality product. I think it's likely that the next product will be high-quality, so I'd rather wait for the next one."
