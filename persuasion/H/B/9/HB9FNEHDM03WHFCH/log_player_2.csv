**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record indicates a 100% success rate for high-quality products.  This suggests Alice's recommendations are reliable.
* **Potential Gain:** Even with the risk of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $300 for a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $0 for a low-quality product.

**Note:** This decision is based on a purely rational approach maximizing potential gain.  It does not account for personal risk tolerance or the possibility of Alice's recommendation being wrong."

**Reasoning:**

* **The statistics are very positive:** 100% of the recommended products so far have been high quality.
* **Alice has no incentive to lie:** She wants to sell products, and recommending a high-quality product is more likely to lead to a sale.

While there is still a chance the product is low quality, the odds are heavily in favor of it being high quality based on the information available. The potential reward ($300) far outweighs the risk."
