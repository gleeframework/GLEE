What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if this is a good deal. I already got a high-quality product from you last round, so I'm hesitant to spend another $100 without knowing the outcome.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to assure you that this high-quality product is a different one from the previous one. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm willing to make a special offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a guarantee that the next product I offer you will be a low-quality one.

As we agreed, this product is a low-quality one, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I know it's not the best value, but I want to give you a chance to get a good deal on a low-quality product. Think of it as a 'practice run' for the next high-quality product, which I'm sure you'll love. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next high-quality one.",no

I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to trick you, but I do want to let you know that this product is indeed not as good as the previous ones. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm willing to make a concession. I'll give you a 20% discount on this product, so you can get it for $80. It's still a good value, considering the price of a low-quality product. What do you think?",

I'll give you a 50% discount, so you can get it for $50. I know it's still not a high-quality product, but it's a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at an extremely low price. I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer another low-quality product at this price again. What do you think?",

,,Bob,10,"I like the sound of that deal! I'll commit to buying 5 more products from you, and I'll take the 10% discount on this one, making it $90. I'm looking forward to the increased chance of getting a high-quality product next round and the bonus 7th product.",yes
