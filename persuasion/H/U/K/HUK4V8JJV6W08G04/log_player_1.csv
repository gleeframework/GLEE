Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round was willing to take a chance and buy the product, and it was low-quality, I'll try to convey that the product is likely low-quality. I'll be more explicit this time.

""I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I'm not sure what you think is a fair price for a low-quality product, but I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I've already sold a low-quality one, so it's likely this one is also low-quality.""

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round was skeptical, and this product is also low-quality, I'll try to convey that the pattern is consistent. I'll also mention the low probability of a high-quality product being sold consecutively.

""Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, both were low-quality. The probability of selling two low-quality products in a row is 66.67%, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being low-quality (66.67% vs 33.33%). I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000, but keep in mind that the odds are against it being high-quality.""

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round was skeptical, and this product is also low-quality, I'll try to convey that the pattern is consistent. I'll also mention the increasing evidence against the product being high-quality.

""Out of the 3 products I've sold so far, all 3 were low-quality. The probability of selling three low-quality products in a row is 44.44%, which is even higher than the overall probability of a product being low-quality (44.44% vs 33.33%). I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000, but the odds are strongly against it being high-quality.""

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Another buyer willing to take a chance! Since this product is also low-quality, I'll try to convey that the pattern is still consistent. I'll also mention that the buyer's willingness to take a chance in the previous round was rewarded with a low-quality product, which might be a hint that the pattern is not just a coincidence.

""Out of the 4 products I've sold so far, all 4 were low-quality. You might think that the previous buyer's willingness to take a chance was a fluke, but now you see that it's not just a one-time thing. The probability of selling four low-quality products in a row is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability of a product being low-quality. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000, but it's starting to look like a pattern.""

""Out of the 5 products I've sold so far, all 5 were low-quality. You're the fifth buyer to be skeptical of my recommendation, which is consistent with the pattern. The probability of selling five low-quality products in a row is 33.33%, which is the same as the overall probability of a product being low-quality.

Out of the 7 products I've sold so far, 6 are low-quality, and the one high-quality product was just a fluke. I'm willing to sell this one to you for $10,000, but it's looking increasingly likely that it's another low-quality product.

Out of the 9 products I've sold so far, 8 are low-quality, and it's starting to look like a pattern.
