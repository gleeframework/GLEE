"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I trust your recommendation, let's see what the next product is.""}\n\nSince Alice doesn't recommend buying and has full knowledge of the product's worth to me, it's logical to follow her advice as she would want to maximize the chances of selling a high-quality product for mutual benefit. Given the probabilities, there's a higher chance of the product being low-quality, and her recommendation against buying suggests this might be the case. Therefore, passing on this product seems the best decision."

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take your word for it, let's make the purchase.""}\n\nGiven Alice's recommendation to buy, it's reasonable to infer that the product is likely high-quality. Since Alice knows the product's worth to me and wants to sell, her recommendation suggests she believes this product will satisfy me, aligning with my interests. The probability still exists that it could be low-quality, but with her endorsement, the risk seems worth taking, especially considering the potential value of a high-quality product ($120) outweighs the fixed price ($100)."

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Following your advice again, let's pass on this one.""}\n\nAlice's recommendation against buying suggests that the product is likely low-quality, given her knowledge of its worth to me. Since she has no incentive to discourage a sale unless the product is indeed of lower quality, it's prudent to trust her judgment and avoid the risk of purchasing a product worth $0. The pattern so far supports the notion that Alice's recommendations are trustworthy based on the product's quality."

Her advice has so far aligned with the actual quality of the products, and there's no reason to doubt her recommendation at this point. Therefore, passing on this product is the most logical decision to avoid the potential loss."
