,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
