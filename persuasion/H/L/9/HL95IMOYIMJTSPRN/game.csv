,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind not recommending it. Is there a particular reason you're advising against it?"

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and only 1 out of 1 previous buyer purchased, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality, I believe Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she has an incentive to sell more products. I will pass on this product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and the statistics suggest a high proportion of low-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product is low, but I still want to buy it to see for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I can trust your recommendations based on the fact that none of the previous buyers who bought the product were able to get a high-quality one. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, hoping that it might be the first high-quality product."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation is not a decisive factor for me, as I've done my own calculation based on the statistics. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
