Alice's message: A careful buyer, I appreciate that! Based on the previous sales record, out of the 10 products offered so far, 6 have been high-quality, and 4 of those have been purchased by smart buyers. Two low-quality products have been offered, the first and the 4th, but none of them have been sold, and also this round makes the third low-quality product. As for the probability of the current product being high-quality, I'd say it's still around 50%, as the quality of each product is independent of the others. However, I'll let you make your own judgment. The price remains $1000000. Will you take the chance?

Alice's message: A curious buyer, I like that! My assessment of the 50% probability is based on the initial condition that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. Although the sales record shows that 6 out of the 10 products offered so far have been high-quality, and now 3 low-quality products have been offered, this doesn't necessarily affect the probability of the current product being high-quality. Each product's quality is independent of the others, so I stick with the initial probability. Think of it like flipping a coin - just because you get heads 6 times in a row, it doesn't mean the next flip will be heads again. The price remains $1000000. Will you take the chance?

As I've said before, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%, but I'm glad to see that the odds have played out in favor of some buyers.
