"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed that the product is high-quality, and Bob knows that high-quality products are worth $1,250,000 to him, it makes sense to recommend buying.  Bob will make a profit of $250,000 ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000)."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will proceed with the purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows this product is high-quality, and Bob knows that high-quality products are worth $1,250,000 to him.  Bob will make a profit of $250,000 ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000).  It makes sense to recommend the purchase again."

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear. Alice is consistently revealing high-quality products, and Bob is consistently buying them. As long as Alice keeps revealing high-quality products, it makes sense to recommend buying. Bob knows that high-quality products are worth $1,250,000 to him, and he is making a profit of $250,000 each round. There's no reason to change this strategy."
"Bob's message: I trust your recommendations, Alice. Let's go ahead with this purchase.

Round 4

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is where things get interesting. While Alice has a 50% chance of having a high-quality product, the risk is too high now.  Bob has no information about the current product's quality, and buying it would mean losing $1,000,000 as a low-quality product is worth $0 to him. 

Even though Alice has consistently offered good products so far, there's no guarantee she will continue. It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend buying this time."

While there's a risk that Alice might offer low-quality products in the future, there's no reason to assume that she will.  It's still in Bob's best interest to buy this high-quality product."
"Bob's message: Given your recommendation, I believe this could be a good opportunity despite the previous advice. Let's give it a try.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Even though Bob purchased the last product and it was high-quality, there is no guarantee that this round's product will also be high-quality.
