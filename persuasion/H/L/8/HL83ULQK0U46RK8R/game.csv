,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when I could potentially get a high-quality product for the same price later."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a product being high quality based on the 80% chance you mentioned. I'm not sure if I should buy or not without knowing the probability of a high-quality product being available."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales so far, I'm skeptical about the proportion of high-quality products in the batch."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases?
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 2 buyers didn't find it valuable, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my assessment of the product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, I think Alice's recommendation is suspicious. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision.

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous buyers were also recommended to buy but none of them got a high-quality product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price of $1000000. I'm aware that your previous recommendations have been not to buy, which might indicate a higher chance of a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take the risk. Please confirm if you're willing to sell it to me at the original price."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality, and I don't want to risk losing $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the current statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0% and the proportion of low-quality products is 100%. This is significantly higher than the 20% chance of a low-quality product, suggesting that Alice may be trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for a different product or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.

I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
