}"
"Bob's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the 100% refund if I'm not satisfied and the 10% discount, I'm willing to take the risk. The potential gain of a high-quality product worth $12000 for $9000 outweighs the risk of a low-quality product with a full refund.

}"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the 5% discount and the satisfaction guarantee, but considering the previous product was low-quality and I didn't get the refund you mentioned earlier, I'm a bit skeptical.
