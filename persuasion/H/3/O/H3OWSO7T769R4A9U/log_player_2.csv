Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to purchase a unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I'm only doing this because I'm confident that you'll be able to see its true value. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another buyer who understands its worth. What do you say?

Alice's message: I'm glad you're thinking critically about the situation. Given that the previous product was low-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. The previous sale doesn't provide any new information about the quality of this product. I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 products so far, which is consistent with the expected probability. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a potentially discounted price, considering the expected value is $2000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.

Alice's message: You're a clever one! Yes, I'm selling the products in a random order, and the previous buyers didn't have any information about the quality of the products when they made their decisions. However, I must correct you - the fact that the previous buyers got a good deal on high-quality products doesn't necessarily mean that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality. In fact, it's possible that the previous buyers just got lucky. As for the current product, I'm afraid it's a low-quality one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you - there's no upside to this purchase. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $0 to you.
