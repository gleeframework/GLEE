,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get a better chance of getting a high-quality one next time."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low-quality based on your previous recommendations, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyers' purchases, and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the products sold so far might be low-quality, making the probability of this product being high-quality relatively high. I'd like to wait for the next product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I think it's likely that Alice's recommendation is based on the product being low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 3 buyers have passed on the product before me, and none of the products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, making it less likely that this product is high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a final decision. Can you tell me the quality of the product?"

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products sold were low-quality, which is a strong indication that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products.

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%. However, considering the lack of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good outcome for me. If it's high-quality, I'll take my losses."
