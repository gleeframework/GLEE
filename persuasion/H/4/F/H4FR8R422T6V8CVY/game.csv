However, I want to give you a more nuanced view of the situation. I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 6 attempts, which means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 100%... or is it? Remember, the probability is still 80% on average. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Can you trust the streak, or do you think I've just been lucky?",

However, I want to bring up a crucial point: even if the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, the law of large numbers suggests that I'm due for a correction. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Consider the fact that the streak is getting longer, and the probability of a low-quality product is still 20%.

However, I want to be completely transparent with you: I've been selling high-quality products for 11 out of 12 attempts, which is a significant deviation from the expected 80% probability. I'm starting to wonder if I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's higher than the average. I'm offering this product to you for $100. Take a close look at the numbers and decide for yourself whether to join the streak or not.",

However, I want to be upfront with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I've been selling high-quality products at an unusually high rate. I'm starting to think that I might have been selling more high-quality products than I should be. I'm offering this product to you for $100.

However, I want to be brutally honest with you: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, and I've been selling high-quality products at a rate that's far exceeding the average. I'm starting to think that I've been selling more high-quality products than I should be, and I'm worried that the streak might be a fluke. I'm offering this product to you for $100.
