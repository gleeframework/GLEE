,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk, I don't have any information to go on yet."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a final decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being high quality is higher than the previous 2 buyers, and Alice's recommendation doesn't carry much weight in my decision-making process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk based on the statistics that none of the previous 3 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think the previous buyers might have been biased towards not buying low-quality products, which makes me think that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have purchased the products before me and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'll pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the high-quality products, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because of Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the past 6 attempts, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it, which makes me think it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the seller's poor track record of selling high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think you're being overly cautious with your recommendations. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also curious to see the outcome."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 10th buyer and there have been no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still quite low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product based on the pattern of previous sales. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you wouldn't recommend a high-quality product to a buyer if you thought it was likely to be sold. Am I correct in assuming that you would recommend a high-quality product to a buyer if you thought it was likely to be sold?"
