"Round 1
Alice's message: This is the first product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product for $100, but it's also possible that it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering the potential value of a high-quality product is $400. If you're not sure, you can always wait for the next round, but I think this is a good chance to take a risk and potentially get a great product.

I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $100, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $20 discount on the next product you buy from me.

I'll give you a $50 refund for the low-quality product you didn't buy last round, so you'll actually get a net gain of $50 if you buy this one.
