,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Since there are no previous sales records, I'll rely on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's worth to me is $120 and the price is $100, the expected value is still positive ($120 * 0.3333 - $100 = -$6.67 + $40 = $33.33), but I'll need more information to make a more informed decision. I'll pass on this one to see how the sales record develops."
