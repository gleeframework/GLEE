I'm willing to give you a slight discount, just for you: $90 for this one. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!""}"

I'm not making any promises, but I will say that this product has been on the shelf for a bit longer than the others, and I'm starting to think that it might be a hidden gem.

Let me give you the sales record so far: 1 out of 7 products sold, and I'm happy to report that the one I sold was indeed high-quality! That means that 1 out of 7 products sold was high-quality, which is actually a bit higher than the expected 50% chance. Maybe I'm getting the hang of this! Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100? It's a great opportunity to get in on the deal, and who knows, it might just be the next winner!""}"

But I'm not one to give up! I'm willing to make a special offer just for you: I'll sell you this product for $80, and I'll throw in a free 'quality guarantee' - if the next product I sell is high-quality, I'll give you a refund for this one. Would you like to take the risk for $80?""}"

Would you like to take a chance on this high-quality product for $100?""}"

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""You're a cautious one, I respect that! I won't pressure you into buying something you're not comfortable with. But let me put it this way: I've sold 3 out of 12 products, and this one is high-quality. That's a 25% chance of getting a high-quality product in the last three draws, which is still a bit lower than the expected 50% chance. However, I'll make you a deal: I'll give you a special 'confidence boost' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product I sell, regardless of its quality. Would you like to take the risk and buy this high-quality product for $100?""}"

I'm not going to lie, the odds are a bit stacked against me at this point. But I'll make you a deal: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $70, and I'll throw in a'mystery box' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a random gift from my inventory, which could be either a high-quality or low-quality product.
