Alice's message: Congratulations on considering this amazing product! With 1 out of 1 product sold so far, 1 of which is high-quality, I'm confident that this product has a high chance of being high-quality as well. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a steal considering its potential value. I'm sure you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take it home today?
