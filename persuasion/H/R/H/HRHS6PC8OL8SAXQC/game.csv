,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product I'm offered may also be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a low-quality product for $1000000, and I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm going to pass on this product. The probability of this product being low-quality is 66.67% and the recommendation from Alice is likely based on her own self-interest rather than any information about the product's quality."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and would rather not risk $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, I think it's more likely that the product is low quality. If I pass, you'll have to discard it, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the past sales record. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product.
