,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, I'm going to assume the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you provide more information about the previous sales record, like the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the overall probability (80%). I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and I'd rather wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending it, and I'd like to see the current statistics again before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the limited data, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the current product being high quality is still relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
