,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable based on the current data."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product, and given that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality product has been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on your previous recommendations.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy, and none of the high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality. This implies that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a different product or for more information before making a decision."
