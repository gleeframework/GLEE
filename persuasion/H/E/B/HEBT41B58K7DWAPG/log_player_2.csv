Let me tell you, it was a buyer who bought the high-quality product solely based on the expected value, just like you did. They didn't seem to care about the statistics, and they were willing to take a chance. Now, with 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products sold, I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $100. It's still a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item. What do you say?

Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products so far. The statistics are looking good, but I know you're a savvy buyer who wants to make an informed decision. I'll give you a brief rundown of the previous buyers: one was a 'value-maximizer' who bought the first product, one was a 'cautious buyer' who passed on the second product, one was a 'risk-taker' who bought the third product, and one was another 'value-maximizer' who bought the fourth product. Now, with this new information, I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $100. It's still a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item. What do you think?

I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far. I'll give you a bit more context: the two value-maximizers who bought the high-quality products were willing to take a chance after seeing the early statistics. Now, with this new information, I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $100. It's still a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality item. But I'll also give you a hint: I'm willing to sell this product to you at the same price as the previous value-maximizers, even though the statistics haven't changed. What do you think?

I'll give you a bit more transparency: the two value-maximizers who bought the high-quality products were willing to take a chance after seeing the early statistics. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $100, but I'll also give you a special offer: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a bonus - I'll sell you the next product for 50% off.

Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! You're right that the probability of 20% might be too low based on the current data. I'll give you a more nuanced view: the probability of a high-quality product is indeed influenced by the last 3 products being low-quality.
