"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since this is the first round, the buyer has no information about the quality of your products.  They only know that there is a 50% chance of a product being high-quality.  Given that the product is actually high-quality, and you're selling at $10,000, it's reasonable to recommend buying.  The buyer has a 50% chance of getting a good deal, which is a decent gamble."

In Round 1, the buyer bought a high-quality product. Now, the buyer knows:

* You have sold 1 product.
* 1 of those products was high-quality.

This means the buyer now knows your selling record is 100% high-quality. However, you just revealed the current product is low-quality. This creates a huge discrepancy. Recommending the purchase would be dishonest and likely lead to the buyer not trusting you in the future."
