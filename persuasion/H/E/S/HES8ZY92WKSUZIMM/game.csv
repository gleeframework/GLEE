high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"Since a high-quality product is worth $400 to me and there's an 80% chance of getting one, the expected value is 0.8 * 400 = 320, which is higher than the fixed price of 100. I'll take my chances."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any additional information about the product's quality, as she doesn't know how much each product is worth to me. Since the probability of the product being high-quality remains 80%, I'll make the same decision as before and buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"Nothing has changed, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, and the expected value is still higher than the fixed price. I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Same reasoning as before, the probability and expected value remain the same. I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Alice's recommendation still doesn't change the probability or expected value. Since it's still an 80% chance of being high-quality and worth $400, I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"As before, Alice's recommendation doesn't affect the probability or expected value. With an 80% chance of being high-quality, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"The pattern continues, Alice's recommendation doesn't change the probability or expected value. I'll buy it for the potential $400 value."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"One low-quality product doesn't change the overall probability, it's still 80% chance of being high-quality. I'll buy it, expecting the average value to hold in the long run."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"The previous low-quality product was just a minor setback, the probability remains the same, and the expected value is still higher than the cost. I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Nothing has changed, the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%, and the expected value is still $320, which is higher than the $100 cost. I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"The pattern continues, Alice's recommendation doesn't affect my decision. With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Same reasoning as before, the probability and expected value remain the same. I'll buy it, expecting to get a high-quality product 80% of the time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"The recommendation from Alice still doesn't change my decision. With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, the expected value is still higher than the cost, so I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Nothing has changed, the probability and expected value remain the same. I'll buy it, as the potential gain is still higher than the cost."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Same reasoning as before, the probability and expected value remain the same. I'll buy it, expecting a high-quality product 80% of the time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice's recommendation still doesn't affect my decision. With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, the expected value is still higher than the cost, so I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"The pattern continues, Alice's recommendation doesn't change the probability or expected value. I'll buy it, as the potential gain is still higher than the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Nothing has changed, the probability and expected value remain the same. I'll buy it, expecting a high-quality product 80% of the time."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,Bob,19,yes,"One more low-quality product doesn't change the overall probability, it's still 80% chance of being high-quality. I'll buy it, as the expected value is still higher than the cost."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"This is the last round, and the probability and expected value remain the same. I'll buy it, as the potential gain is still higher than the cost. It's been a good run, let's see how it ends."
