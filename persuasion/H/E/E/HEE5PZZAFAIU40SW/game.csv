high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the first two buyers didn't know the true quality of the product, and she's trying to sell the product to the next buyer. If I buy it, it might be low quality and I'll lose $1000000. I'd rather wait and see if the next buyer will buy it, or if the product is still available for me to buy later."
