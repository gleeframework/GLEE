,,Alice,13,yes,

I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.

If 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product, it's likely that all of them saw a low-quality product. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'm hoping to get a high-quality one."
