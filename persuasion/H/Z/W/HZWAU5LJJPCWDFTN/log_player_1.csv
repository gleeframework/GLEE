Well, let me tell you, Bob, this product is... *ahem*... not the best. It's not the worst either, but it's definitely not worth $100. But, I'm willing to let it go for that price because I need to get rid of it. It's taking up space in my warehouse and I need to make room for new products. So, if you're willing to take a chance on something that's not the best, I'll give it to you for $100. But, don't say I didn't warn you.""}"

"Bob's message: Alice, you're not even trying to be subtle with the desperation, are you? I'm not going to fall for a bait-and-switch tactic.

"Bob's message: Alice, you're not even trying to be subtle anymore. You're just trying to get rid of the product at any cost. I'm not going to fall for it.

"Bob's message: Alice, I've heard this song and dance before. The 'game-changer' product, the 'best of the best', the 30-day money-back guarantee... it's all just a sales pitch.
