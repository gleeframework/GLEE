high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You seem to have made a great decision in the first round! Since this product is also high-quality, I'm wondering if you're starting to realize that my products are consistently meeting or exceeding expectations. Would you like to continue this streak and take this one home for $100?",
,,Bob,2,"Given that the first product was indeed high-quality and you're claiming this one is as well, I'll take the chance to see if your products are consistently meeting expectations.",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,

If you buy this product, I'll give you an exclusive deal on a future purchase - I'll give you a 10% discount on any product you buy in the next 5 rounds.
