I'd like to point out that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've already sold one high-quality product out of the first 3 products I've offered. This suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than the average. I'm offering this product to you for $1,000,000. If you buy it, you'll be getting a great deal, considering the increased likelihood of it being high-quality.""}"

If you buy it, you'll get a great deal, and you'll be helping me to clear out some inventory.""}"

This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is 33.33% (2/6). I'm offering this product to you for $1,000,000. Considering the average probability of a product being high-quality, I think this is a fair price.""}"
