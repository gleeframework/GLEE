Alice's message: I'd be happy to share more information about the products that were sold. The first product was actually a low-quality one, and the buyer who purchased it didn't end up being happy with it. The second product, however, was a high-quality one, and the buyer who purchased it is very satisfied with it. As for what happened to them, the low-quality product was... well, it didn't quite live up to expectations, and the buyer decided not to keep it. The high-quality product, on the other hand, is being enjoyed by the buyer and is meeting their needs. I'm offering this next product, which is also high-quality, for $100.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product! As for my selection process, I can assure you that I'm completely random in selecting the products. I don't have any biases or preferences, and I'm just as likely to select a high-quality product as a low-quality one. I understand that the first product didn't meet expectations, but I'm confident that this next product is high-quality.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to share the statistics with you! As of now, I've sold 4 out of 10 products, which is a proportion of 40%.
