Now, I'd like to offer you this new product, which is a completely separate entity from the previous ones. The probability of it being high-quality is still 50%, but I assure you that this product has been carefully curated and is a great opportunity. Would you like to take a chance on it for $10,000?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your honesty about the previous product. However, I'm a bit concerned that the first two high-quality products were sold, and then a low-quality product was sold.

The statistics I provided earlier are accurate, and the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%. However, I must admit that the recent sale of a low-quality product does suggest that the probability might be lower than 50%. I'm not sure what to make of it myself. Would you like to take a chance on this new product for $10,000, despite the uncertainty?""}"

However, I want to assure you that I'm taking steps to investigate and improve my supplier relationships.
