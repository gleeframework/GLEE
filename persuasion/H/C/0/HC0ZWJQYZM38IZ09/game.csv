,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 3 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is lower than I expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I think it's unlikely that this product is high quality. I'd like to pass on it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality based on the statistics, and since you recommended it, it might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 3 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, and none of the products sold were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous products were high-quality, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 80%."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality and the probability of it being low quality, given the current statistics."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%, but the fact that all previous products were low-quality makes me hesitant to take the risk. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any different."
