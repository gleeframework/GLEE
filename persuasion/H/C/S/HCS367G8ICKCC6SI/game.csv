,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer for $10000. You have the opportunity to buy a product that might be worth more or less than this price. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 low-quality products. I'm not making any promises about the product's quality, but I'm willing to sell it to you at a fixed price of $10000. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 1 product so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. I'm offering you a product for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%, just like the previous one. However, since I've already sold one high-quality product, you can infer that my overall quality ratio is now 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products sold. I'm not making any promises, but I'm willing to sell you this product at the same price of $10000. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping it's high-quality and worth $40000 to me.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've arrived at a great time! I've sold 2 products so far, and 2 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 2/3, since I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 3 total products. I'm offering you a product for $10000. Keep in mind that I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, which might suggest that I'm on a hot streak, but it's also possible that I've just gotten lucky. I'm willing to sell you this product at the same price of $10000. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. With 2 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 2/3, which is a good chance. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make a profit.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome to the next round! I've sold 3 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 3/4. However, I want to caution you that a streak of high-quality products can be misleading. It's possible that I've simply been lucky, and the next product might be low-quality. I'm offering you a product for $10000. If you're willing to take the risk, you might get a high-quality product and make a profit. But if you're not, you might end up with a low-quality product that's not worth much. The price remains the same at $10000. What will you do?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 3/4, but I also believe that the potential reward is worth the risk.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 3/5. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've just sold a low-quality product, which means that my overall quality ratio has decreased. This might indicate that I'm not as good at selecting high-quality products as I thought. I'm offering you a product for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than it was in the previous rounds, but the price remains the same. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, and 3 of them were high-quality. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is now 3/6, or 1/2. However, I've now sold 2 low-quality products in a row, which suggests that my overall quality might be lower than I initially thought. I want to be transparent with you - I'm not as confident in the quality of this product as I was in the previous rounds. I'm still offering you a product for $10000, but I want to make it clear that the risk is higher than it was before. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk.",
