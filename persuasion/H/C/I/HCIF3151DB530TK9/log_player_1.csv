Round 13
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial moment. You have a high-quality product, and while the buyer remains hesitant, it's time to try a different approach. This buyer, like the previous ones, is deeply affected by the lack of sales history.  Instead of emphasizing the potential profit, focus on building trust and showing that you're not trying to deceive them.  

Here's how to frame your message:

* **Acknowledge their concern:** ""I understand you're hesitant to buy without any previous sales. I get it, it's a risk.""
* **Emphasize your honesty:** ""I've been upfront about the quality of each product so far, even when it meant losing a sale. That's how I build trust.""
* **Offer a guarantee:** ""To show you I believe in the quality of this product, I'm willing to offer a full refund if it turns out to be low-quality. That way, you have nothing to lose."" 

This strategy is risky, but it could be the key to breaking through the buyer's resistance. You're taking a chance, but you have a high-quality product, and this could be the move that turns things around."
