,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the products being offered are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data or a change in Alice's recommendations before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if it's high-quality, Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that she's seen no high-quality products sold yet, so she's more likely to recommend a high-quality product to me. I'd rather wait and see if the next product has a different recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still relatively low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one."
