It's only $100, and it's a chance to take a risk on a product that might just surprise you.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. With a probability of 35.29% of a product being high-quality, I'd rather wait for more information and see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases.

}"
