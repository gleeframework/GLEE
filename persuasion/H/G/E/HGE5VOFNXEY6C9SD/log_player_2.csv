Alice's message: Welcome to my collection! I'm glad to have you interested in one of my unique products. As you may know, I've sold one product so far, and it was indeed a high-quality one. However, I must remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, as each product has an equal chance of being high-quality or low-quality. With that in mind, I'm still confident that this product has great potential, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as before, $1000000. What do you think?

Alice's message: Thank you for considering my product! As you've seen, my previous sale was indeed a high-quality product, but I want to be transparent with you - the fact that this product is not high-quality doesn't necessarily mean it's not valuable. In fact, I've had buyers in the past who were thrilled with their purchase, even if the product wasn't high-quality. With that in mind, I'm still willing to let this product go for the same price as before, $1000000. I believe the potential benefits outweigh the risk, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product! As for my sales process, I can assure you that I don't manipulate which product to offer to each buyer. The selection is purely random. I have a vast collection of products, and each time a new buyer arrives, I randomly select one from the collection to offer to them. This way, each product has an equal chance of being offered to a buyer. The 50% proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed due to chance, and I'm willing to continue offering products to you with the same random selection process.
