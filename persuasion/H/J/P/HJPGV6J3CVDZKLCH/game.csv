low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob.  This product is similar to the last one in terms of potential, but it's important to remember that every product is unique.  I believe this one has a good chance of being a profitable investment for you.  Do you want to take a chance?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your understanding, but I need to see more concrete evidence of the quality of your products before I can take a chance. I'm not comfortable making a decision based solely on your recommendations.",no

Would you be interested in acquiring this product for a reduced price?",
