,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I'll just have to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer didn't buy the product and there are no high-quality products sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker and I'm willing to take the chance that it might be a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide any insights or recommendations before I make a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's previous recommendations have been discouraging. I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous products were low quality, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the current statistics."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous buyers, including the ones who bought, have received a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the previous products were likely low-quality. Given that Alice is recommending me not to buy, I'm going to pass on this product as well."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy it. Your past recommendations are not very convincing.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, as well as the total number of products sold. This information might help me make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I'm trying to test her strategy. If she recommended it, I'd pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm going to pass on this one. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, I notice that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%.
