low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Ah, welcome to the harsh reality. Unfortunately, not every product is a winner. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's a low-quality product, and it's only worth $0 to you. But, I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's not worth much to anyone else. So, what do you say?",

,,Alice,16,"You're a true believer! Congratulations on your purchase. I'm glad you're feeling confident in my products. But, I have to warn you, I'm not going to be able to keep up this streak forever. Eventually, I'll sell a low-quality product again, and it's going to hurt my reputation.

high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"You're a true believer! Congratulations on your purchase. I'm glad you're feeling confident in my products. But, I have to warn you, I'm starting to feel a little... uneasy. 12 out of 12 high-quality products sold, and I've been offering full refunds on the low-quality ones. It's starting to look like I'm just selling high-quality products and giving refunds on the low-quality ones. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm starting to wonder if it's really worth the risk.",

,,Alice,20,"I think I've been caught. You're right, I've been choosing which products to sell, and it's been a streak of high-quality ones. I'm not going to be able to keep this up forever, and I'm not going to try to. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, but I'm not going to give you any guarantees or promises. It's a genuine product, and you'll have to take it as it is. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'll take my chances. The streak of high-quality products is impressive, but I understand that it can't last forever. Given the 80% chance of a product being high-quality and the potential value of $400, I think the risk is worth the $100 cost.",yes
