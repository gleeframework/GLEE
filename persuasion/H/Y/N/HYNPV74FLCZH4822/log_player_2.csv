"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since there's a 50/50 chance of the product being high quality or low quality, and Alice is recommending it, it's a gamble worth taking.  The potential gain ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0)."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $125 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take another chance!""}
