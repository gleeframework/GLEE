"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

In the first round, the buyer has no information about your selling history. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and the buyer doesn't know the value of a high-quality product, it's a gamble. 

It's a good idea to start by recommending the buyer to purchase, as this will help build trust and provide data for future rounds. If the buyer is risk-averse, they might choose not to buy, but in this situation, recommending the purchase is the best strategy to maximize potential sales."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. Let's hope it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Now the buyer has some data.  They know you've sold one product, and it was high quality.  Since you're offering the product at a fixed price, and they don't know the value of a low-quality product, it's highly unlikely they'd be willing to buy a second product without more information. 

It's better to try and build trust and a positive selling history before offering a low-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I will pass on this product.  While the initial sale was a high-quality product, I'm hesitant to buy without more information about the overall quality of the products you're offering.  
The buyer didn't bought the product.

However, the current product is high-quality, and you need to try and regain trust.  It's still a gamble, but recommending this purchase has a higher chance of success than recommending the low-quality product in the previous round."

Offering a low-quality product again risks further eroding their trust and makes it less likely they will purchase. It's best to hold off on recommending a purchase until you have a high-quality product again."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since you are not recommending me to buy the product, and the sales record shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, I believe the current product is likely low quality. I will pass on this one.
