"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product for now.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice does not recommend the product, and there's a 66.67% chance of it being low quality (worth $0 to you), it's more likely to be a bad deal. It's best to pass on this product and see what other options come up."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is valuable information, even if she doesn't know the exact value to me. Since she recommends buying, it implies she believes the product has a higher probability of being high quality. While there's still a chance it's low quality, the potential payoff of $120 outweighs the risk of $0 loss, given Alice's recommendation."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product for now.  You're not recommending it, and even though the last one was high-quality, I'm hesitant to take another chance without your support.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong indicator.  Even though the last product was high-quality, her lack of recommendation on this one makes it more likely that this product is low-quality.  It's better to be safe than sorry and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been consistently accurate so far. Two consecutive ""no"" recommendations strongly suggest that this product is likely low quality.  It's safer to pass and wait for a more favorable opportunity."

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**
