Round 2
Alice's message: You've already experienced the value of a high-quality product, and I'm glad you're excited about it. However, I want to make it clear that this next offer is not necessarily a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $1000000, but I want to make it clear that it's a separate entity from the previous product. If you're willing to take the risk, this could be another incredible deal. But if you're not, I completely understand. The decision is yours.

I'm not saying it's not a good product, but I want to make it clear that the price is non-negotiable. If you're still interested, I'll let you have it. But if you're starting to think I'm taking advantage of you, I completely understand.
