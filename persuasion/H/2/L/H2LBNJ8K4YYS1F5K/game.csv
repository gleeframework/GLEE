,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the outcome of its quality before making a decision, as I don't have any information about its quality."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as there's no information about its quality yet."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd rather wait to see the outcome of my decision to inform my future choices."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take a chance, I have no information to go on, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if it's a high-quality product and get a better sense of the distribution of product qualities."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as there have been no high-quality products sold so far. This suggests that the products sold may have been low-quality, which would imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know if the previous buyers passed or bought the products they were offered, and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales record."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation and the statistics suggest there's a high chance it's low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice recommended 2 previous buyers to buy and they both passed, I suspect that the products they were offered were low-quality. Given the low probability of this happening by chance, I believe Alice's recommendations are likely to be biased towards low-quality products. Therefore, I will pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation. This suggests that the previous products may have been low-quality, which would mean that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm doing this based on the fact that you haven't sold any high-quality products yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the statistics or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the probability of it being high quality is still quite low based on the previous sales record. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
