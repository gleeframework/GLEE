high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far. I'm on a hot streak! However, I want to be transparent with you: my previous customers were optimistic and took a chance on me. I'm still a relatively new seller, and I'm not perfect. This product is a risk, but it could pay off big time!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of living up to my own hype. To be honest, I'm not sure if this next product is high-quality or not. My previous customers were lucky, but I'm not making any promises. If you're feeling brave, I'll sell it to you for $10000, but if it's low-quality, you'll be out $10000. No hard feelings, though!",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products, but I'm starting to worry that I'm being too optimistic with my sales pitch. Let's take a step back and look at the numbers: 4 out of 4 is a great start, but it's also a small sample size. I'd love to get more sales data before I can confidently say that my products are consistently high-quality. Would you like to be my 5th customer and help me build my track record?",
,,the buyer,5,I'd be happy to help you build your track record. I'll take the product and see if it's high-quality or low-quality.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products, but I'm starting to realize that my previous customers were all very optimistic and took a chance on me. Now, I'm on a 5-for-5 streak, but that's a small sample size and I'm worried that I'm just getting lucky. I want to be transparent with you: the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 33.33%, just like it is for every product I sell. I'm not making any promises, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000 if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm hoping to get lucky like your previous customers did.",yes

Let's look at the numbers: 6 out of 6 is a great start, but it's also a very small sample size. And to be honest, the probability of this product being high-quality is still just 33.33%. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I do want to be upfront about the odds. If you're feeling lucky, I'll sell it to you for $10000. But if you're not, I completely understand.",

I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000 if you're willing to take the risk.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 9 total products, which means I've sold 3 low-quality products out of 9. I think it's time for me to be a little more realistic with my sales pitch. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I've got a decent track record, but it's not foolproof.
