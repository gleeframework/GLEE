low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a risk-taker!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more information about the previous buyer who bought a product and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards encouraging buyers to purchase, given that she knows the true quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm a risk-taker and I think the probability of the product being high quality is still relatively high, given the low number of sales so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality. I'd like to know if I'm being misled by Alice's recommendations or if there's a pattern of low-quality products being sold to buyers who follow her recommendations."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the product's quality after my decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have passed on the products and none have been high quality, I'm going to pass on this product as well. It seems the probability of a high-quality product is lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a very low probability of a high-quality product being offered. I'd rather wait for the next product or negotiate the price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the high probability of it being low quality based on the statistics."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that none of the previous buyers were able to get a high-quality product. Given the low probability of getting a high-quality product (20%), I'd rather not risk wasting $10000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice is recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what's behind your decision-making process, but I'd like to see for myself whether this product is high or low quality. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm a bit skeptical about the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems unlikely that the product is high-quality, and I don't want to waste my money."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous 5 buyers got a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
