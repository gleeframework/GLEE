Alice's message: Welcome! I'm offering a product for $1000000.

Your decision is final, and I'm here to answer any questions you might have.

Alice's message: Hello! I'm offering yet another product for $1000000. With a 50% chance of receiving a high-quality item, this price takes into account both the potential reward and the inherent risk.
