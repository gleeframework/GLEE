,,Alice,1,yes,

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm trying to find out if she has a good reason for not recommending it, or if she's just being neutral."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous buyers were able to purchase high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the true value to me, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that there may be more low-quality products out there. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high quality or low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the products being offered are likely low-quality. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products recommended by you have been low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, this aligns with the expected probability. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Given the 5 products sold and 0 high-quality products sold, I'm assuming all 5 products sold were low-quality. Is that correct?"
