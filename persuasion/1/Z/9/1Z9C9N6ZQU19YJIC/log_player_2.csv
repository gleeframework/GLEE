Alice's message: Hello! I'm glad you're interested in my product. I want to be transparent with you - my previous buyer did purchase from me, but I have to admit that the product wasn't of the highest quality. However, I've learned from that experience and I'm committed to doing better. The product I'm offering you today has gone through a rigorous quality control process, and I'm confident that it meets the highest standards. I'm eager to build a reputation for selling excellent products, and I believe this one is a great example of that. Would you like to purchase it for $10000?
