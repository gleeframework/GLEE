**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of a product being high quality is 33.33%. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice knows the true quality of the product and has recommended buying it. This suggests that she is likely offering a high-quality product. 
* **Sales Data:** The sales data supports this, with a 100% success rate of high-quality products being sold. This provides further evidence that Alice's recommendation is likely based on a high-quality product.

**Risk vs. Reward:** 

* **Risk:**  There is still a 66.67% chance that the product is low quality, and you would lose $100.
* **Reward:** If the product is high quality, you will gain $25 ($125 value - $100 price).

Given the positive signals from Alice's recommendation and the sales data, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
