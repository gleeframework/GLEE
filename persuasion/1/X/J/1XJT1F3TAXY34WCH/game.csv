high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. It's a great deal, but if you're not interested, I have 19 more opportunities to find a buyer.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but only because it's a great deal for me, not because I think you're a good negotiator",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm not trying to be a good negotiator, but I am a good seller. This product is still a great value at $10000, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. I've had a lot of positive feedback from other customers who've bought from me, and I'm willing to stand behind the quality of my products, even if this one doesn't meet your expectations. So, what do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this one is a great value at $10000, and I'm not going to pay full price for a product that has a 20% chance of being worthless to me.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're being cautious, and I respect that. Let me ask you a question: if you were to buy 20 products from me, and 16 of them were high-quality, would you be happy with the deal? I'm willing to sell you this product for $10000, but I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy 20 products from me and 16 or more of them are high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for the remaining products. What do you think?",

This is a $2000 value, absolutely free. What do you say?",
