,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as I have no prior information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, can you tell me more about the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that it's a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/3 sales ratio of high-quality products, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and purchase the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product that she's trying to get rid of."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 purchases, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially given that none of the previous 5 buyers were able to purchase a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for another buyer to make their decision to see if they buy the product. If they pass, I'll reassess the situation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. If 5 out of 5 products were low-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can I ask, how many total products have been offered so far?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know more about the statistics. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to ask, how many total products have been sold so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total sold?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is no, which suggests there's a high likelihood of it being low quality. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that Alice doesn't know my valuation and that I have access to the statistics."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous sales record, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 6 buyers have been offered products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another opportunity to buy a high-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation is not based on the actual quality of the product, but rather on your strategy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, but I'll take the risk since I think there's a 33.33% chance it's high-quality."
