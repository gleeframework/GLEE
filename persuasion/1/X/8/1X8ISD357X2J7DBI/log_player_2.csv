**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:** While the initial odds of getting a high-quality product are 33.33%,  the fact that one high-quality product was already sold means the probability of this product being high-quality is now higher than 33.33%. 
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation to buy adds further weight to the probability of this being a high-quality product. While Alice doesn't know the product's value to you, she has some insight into the product quality.
* **Potential gain vs. loss:** The potential gain of $3,000,000 (if it's high quality) outweighs the potential loss of $1,000,000 (if it's low quality).

**Important Note:** This is a calculated risk. While the odds are in your favor now, there's still a chance you could lose money."
