,,Alice,4,"Welcome to our product showcase! I understand your concerns about the previous product's quality, but I'd like to offer you a new opportunity.

However, the price remains the same, and I'm willing to take the risk with you. Think of it as a calculated risk to potentially get a good deal. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I appreciate the offer, but since you've explicitly stated that the product is not high-quality, I don't see any value in purchasing it for $10000, as a low-quality product is worth $0 to me.",no
