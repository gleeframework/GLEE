high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the chance, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on your sales record and the game's rules."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is still 100%, which seems suspiciously high. I'd like to see if the next buyer gets a low-quality product, which would make the proportion of high-quality products more believable."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's purchase, and I don't have enough information to make an informed decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sale before making a decision.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer who bought the high-quality product. What was their decision-making process?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'll take the risk of getting a low-quality product, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality one. I'm basing my decision on the 80.00% chance of the product being high quality and the fact that the previous buyer got a high-quality product, which might indicate that the product distribution is skewed towards high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00%."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to know if Alice's recommendation is reliable based on the current statistics.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, the probability of the product being high-quality is 80.00%, but since only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, it seems the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually lower than 80.00%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is high enough to justify the cost. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous 3 buyers were all willing to buy, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 80%."
