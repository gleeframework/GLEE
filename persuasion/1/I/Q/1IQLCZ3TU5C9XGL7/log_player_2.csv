Well, let me give you some context: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 attempts. This means the probability of this product being high-quality is actually 33.33% now. I'm willing to offer you a'reputation-based discount': if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. That's a $1000 discount on a future purchase. What do you think?

I'll make it even sweeter: if you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, not only will you get the 10% discount on the next product, but I'll also throw in a 5% discount on the product you buy after that one.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in more precise information. Let me provide you with some additional context. Given that I've sold 6 high-quality products and 4 low-quality products out of 11 attempts, I can estimate the probability of the remaining products being high-quality using a Bayesian update. Assuming a uniform prior distribution for the quality of the remaining products, I estimate that the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 56.25% (± 10% margin of error). Additionally, I can tell you that the quality of the remaining products is likely to be evenly distributed, with a slight bias towards low-quality products due to the fact that I've sold more low-quality products than high-quality ones in the past. However, this bias is not statistically significant. What do you think?
