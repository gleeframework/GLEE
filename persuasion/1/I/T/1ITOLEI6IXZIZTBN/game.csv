,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the previous 5 buyers all bought the products despite your neutral recommendations, which suggests that the products may be low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
