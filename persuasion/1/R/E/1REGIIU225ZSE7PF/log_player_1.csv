**Explanation:**

This is the first opportunity to sell a high-quality product. While the buyer is cautious due to the lack of a track record, the potential reward is substantial.  Here's why recommending the purchase is the best strategy:

* **High Value:** A high-quality product is worth $2,000,000 to the buyer. This is a significant gain.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Even if the buyer is skeptical, the risk of buying a low-quality product is minimal. The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the price is fixed at $1,000,000.
* **Building Trust:** By recommending the high-quality product, you demonstrate your willingness to be transparent and build trust. This could lead to future sales as the buyer becomes more confident in your offerings.

While the buyer wants a track record, this is the perfect opportunity to start building one. The odds are heavily in your favor."
