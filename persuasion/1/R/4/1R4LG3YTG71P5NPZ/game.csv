low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got another product for you to consider. To be frank, I have similar reservations about this one as I did the last. I think it's only fair to be upfront with you about that. If you're feeling lucky, it might be worth a shot, but I wouldn't say it's a sure thing.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've got another product here, but I'm afraid it's more of the same. I wouldn't say the odds are in its favor, quality-wise. If you're holding out for something better, I'd say you're making the right call. This one's probably not the one you're looking for.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I don't blame you for being cautious, Bob. Unfortunately, this next product isn't going to change your mind. It's more of the same, and I wouldn't feel right trying to convince you otherwise. If you're looking for a reason to break the streak, this isn't it. Maybe the next one will be different.",
