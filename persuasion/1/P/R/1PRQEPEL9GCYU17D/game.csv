,,Alice,1,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on the lack of sales and the previous buyer's decision to pass. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on your past sales record?

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against buying it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the second buyer and the previous buyer didn't buy it. I'd like to take a chance and see if I get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 only to get $0 value from it."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 buyers have received low-quality products, which suggests a high likelihood of the product being low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and avoid the potential loss."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality has increased. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the probability of a high-quality product has increased further."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know more about the product before making a decision, Alice. Can you tell me the probability of a product being high-quality given the current sales record?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the low quality of the previous products, I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it, which makes me think it's more likely to be low quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the outcome of my purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that all previous buyers have also passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. How many potential buyers have been offered a product, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the statistics.

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
