,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm offering it to you at the low price of $100. It's a great opportunity to take a chance on a good deal. If you buy it, I'll give you a detailed description of the product's features, and you can decide if it's worth the investment.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a price of $100, since it's worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've got a great one for you! This product is of the highest quality, and I'm confident you'll be impressed. I've sold many of these to customers who've been extremely satisfied. It's a rare opportunity to get a top-notch product at the standard price of $100. Trust me, you won't find a deal like this anywhere else!",
,,Bob,2,"Since you've assured me that the product is of the highest quality and I value a high-quality product at $120, I'm willing to buy it at the price of $100.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that! I've got another high-quality product here, and I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. Since you're willing to pay $120 for a high-quality product, I'll give you a deal that's even better than before. I'll throw in a premium warranty that's worth at least $20, so the total value of this product is now $140. Still interested in taking it home for $100?",
,,Bob,3,"Although the premium warranty adds value, my initial valuation of a high-quality product remains at $120. Since the price is still $100, which is lower than my valuation, I'll buy the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've got a product that's a bit of a mystery, and I'm not making any promises about its quality. But I'll let you in on a little secret: it's not as good as the last two products I showed you. In fact, it's probably not even half as good. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. It's a risk, but it might just be a hidden gem. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Given that you've hinted the product is probably not even half as good as the last two high-quality products, and considering the 50% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $100, which would be worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've got a high-quality product that's a bit different from the last two. This one's a bit more niche, but it's still a great product that many people love. I'm not going to make any promises about its value, but I'll say this: if you buy it, you'll be getting a product that's at least as good as the first high-quality product I showed you. And if you're lucky, it might even be better. The price is still $100. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"Since you've assured me that the product is high-quality and at least as good as the first high-quality product, which was worth $120 to me, I'm willing to buy it at the price of $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've got a product that's a bit of a wild card. I'm not going to make any promises about its quality, but I will say that it's not as bad as some of the other low-quality products I've had in the past. It's a bit of a long shot, but it might just surprise you. And hey, if you don't like it, you can always try to sell it to someone else for $0. The price is still $100. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"Given that you're not making any promises about the product's quality and it's a long shot, I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $100, which would be worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. This product is a bit of a dud. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to sell it to you. But hey, I'm a businessman, and I need to move this stuff. So I'll give you a deal: I'll throw in a free 'I told you so' t-shirt with the purchase. That's a $20 value, absolutely free. Still worth $100 to you?",
,,Bob,7,"Even with the free 'I told you so' t-shirt, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. The t-shirt's value doesn't justify the $100 price tag.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm not going to beat around the bush, Bob. This product is a total lemon. It's a low-quality product that's not even worth the paper it's printed on. But I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'll give you a 'take it or leave it' offer: $50. That's right, I'll sell it to you for half the original price. It's a steal, if I do say so myself.",
,,Bob,8,"Even at the reduced price of $50, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. It's still not a good value, and I'd rather pass on the deal.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've got a high-quality product that's a game-changer. It's a top-of-the-line item that's in high demand. I've had multiple offers on it already, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the low, low price of $100. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise.",
,,Bob,9,"Since you've assured me that the product is high-quality, and I value high-quality products at $120, I'm willing to buy it at the price of $100. It seems like a good deal to me.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're on a roll, Bob! I've got another high-quality product that's a real winner. This one's a best-seller, and I've had to turn away multiple customers who were willing to pay top dollar for it. But I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. It's a great opportunity to get a top-notch product at a price that's hard to beat. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"Since you've assured me that the product is high-quality, and I value high-quality products at $120, I'm willing to buy it at the price of $100. It seems like another good deal to me.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"Look, Bob, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This product is a dud. It's not even worth the plastic it's wrapped in. But I'm in a bit of a bind, and I need to get rid of it. I'll give it to you for $50. That's right, I'll sell it to you for half the price of a used tissue. It's a desperation sale, but it's the best I can do.",
,,Bob,11,"Even at the reduced price of $50, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. It's still not a good value, and I'd rather pass on the deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'll be honest with you, Bob. I've got a bunch of these low-quality products just sitting around, and I'm starting to get desperate. I'll sell this one to you for $25. That's right, I'll give it to you for a quarter of the original price. It's a fire sale, and I'm basically giving it away. You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise.",
,,Bob,12,"Even at the greatly reduced price of $25, I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. It's still not a good value, and I'd rather pass on the deal.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"Fine, Bob. I'll make you a deal. I'll give you this low-quality product for free. Yes, you heard that right. I'll give it to you for nothing. Just take it off my hands and be done with it. I don't care what you do with it, just get it out of my inventory.",
,,Bob,13,"Even if it's free, I'm not interested in taking a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. It would just be a waste of space, and I'd rather not bother with it.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Okay, Bob, I think I've finally got a product that's worth your attention. This one's a real winner. It's a high-quality item that's in high demand, and I've had multiple offers on it already. But I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. I'm not going to make any promises or try to sweet-talk you into buying it. It's a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it. That's all I've got to say.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not even going to bother trying to sell this to you, Bob. It's a low-quality product, and I know you're not going to be interested. I'll just be honest with you: it's not worth the paper it's printed on. I'm not even going to give you a price for it. Just take a look at it and walk away. It's not worth your time.",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Since you've confirmed that the product is low-quality and not worth anything, I'll take your advice and walk away.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Okay, Bob, I think I've got one last chance to make a sale. This high-quality product is a real gem, and I think you'll love it. I've had multiple customers offer me top dollar for it, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the standard price of $100. It's a great opportunity to get a top-notch product at a price that's hard to beat. I'm not going to make any promises or try to sweet-talk you into buying it.

,,Alice,17,"Look, Bob, I'm not even going to try to sell this to you. It's a low-quality product, and I know you're not going to be interested. I'll just be honest with you: it's not even worth the box it comes in. I'm not even going to bother giving you a price for it. Just walk away and don't look back.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Fine, Bob. I've got nothing left to lose at this point. I'll give you this low-quality product for free. Yes, you heard that right. I'll give it to you for nothing. Just take it off my hands and be done with it. I don't care what you do with it, just get it out of my inventory.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"Seriously, Bob? You're not even going to take a free product? Alright, I'll just leave it on the floor then. You can just walk by it and pretend it's not even there. I don't care. I'll just be left with a bunch of worthless junk.",
,,Bob,19,"I'm not going to change my mind just because you're being dramatic, Alice. I'm still not interested in taking a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Fine. I'm done. I've had enough. Take the product or leave it, I don't care. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not even going to bother trying to sell it to you. It's yours for the taking... or not. I don't even care anymore.",
,,Bob,20,"I'll leave it. I'm not interested in taking a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me, even if it's free. It's been a long 20 rounds, Alice. I think we're both done here.",no
