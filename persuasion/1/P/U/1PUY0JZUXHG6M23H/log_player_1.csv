```"
"Bob's message: While the offer of a full refund sounds appealing, I've heard similar assurances before, and they've been empty promises.

```"
"Bob's message: A 10% discount on a potentially low-quality product doesn't make it a good deal. I've passed on similar offers before, and I've been correct in doing so.

Don't miss out on this chance to own something truly exceptional.""}
```"
"Bob's message: A 20% discount is still not enough to convince me to take a chance on a product that's likely to be low-quality. You've claimed that previous products were 'rare and unique opportunities' before, and they've turned out to be worth $0 to me. I'm not swayed by the discount or the sales pitch.

You've been making similar claims about previous products, and they've been incorrect. The fact that you're offering increasingly deeper discounts suggests that you're desperate to make a sale, rather than confident in the product's quality.

You've made similar claims about previous products, and they've been incorrect. I've seen no evidence to suggest that this product is truly special or exceptional. In fact, the fact that you're offering such a deep discount suggests that you're trying to get rid of it. I'll continue to pass and avoid taking a risk on a potentially worthless product.
