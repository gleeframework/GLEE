,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the current statistics, it seems like the products sold so far have been low-quality, and I'm not confident in buying without more information."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and your recommendation. I'm concerned that the low quality products are not being weeded out, and I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend buying the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low quality. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0% and the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100%. This suggests that the probability of the current product being high quality is relatively low. I'd like to pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that all previous buyers have also passed on the product after your recommendation, and I'm starting to suspect that there's a pattern here. If all products are indeed 50% high-quality and 50% low-quality, I should expect to see at least one high-quality product sold by now. Since I'm the 6th buyer, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product, hoping that I'll get a better deal in the future."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and I'm willing to take that risk."
