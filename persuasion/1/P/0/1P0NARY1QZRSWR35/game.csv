low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,no,,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer's experience? Did they buy the product after your recommendation?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"I want to assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been reliable, but I'm willing to stake my reputation on this one. Please consider buying it."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were low quality, I'm going to take a chance and pass, hoping that the next product might be high quality.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"Out of the 8 previous products, 3 were high-quality and 5 were low-quality. However, I can assure you that this product is indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products were low quality, I'm skeptical of the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. Out of the 9 previous products, 4 were high-quality and 5 were low-quality. The initial 2 low-quality products may have been a coincidence. I'm confident in the quality of this product."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and considering the high probability of a low-quality product, I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"Although no high-quality products have been sold yet, I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. In fact, out of the 10 previous products, 5 were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were sold. I believe this product is a great opportunity to break that streak."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will take it, potentially increasing the probability of a high-quality product being left for me.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,I must correct your assumption. The probability of a product being high-quality remains 33.33%. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet is simply a coincidence. I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. Don't miss this opportunity.
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Is there any information about it?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"As for your question, out of the 2 products sold so far, both were low-quality."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality so you'll be more likely to recommend the next one to me.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,no,,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, what's the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"The probability of the product being high-quality remains 33.33%, regardless of the previous sales record."
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,"I don't recommend this product because I have knowledge of its quality, and I can assure you that it's low-quality. I'm being transparent with you to maintain trust."
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll take my chances and see if I get a high-quality product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure if I can trust your recommendations, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to take the risk and buy the product to see if it's high-quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk.",
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,Finally! I'm glad to have a high-quality product to offer. I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality. Don't miss this opportunity.
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have been offered the product and none of them found it valuable, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. The fact that Alice recommends it to me doesn't change my decision, as her recommendation is based on the product's quality, not its value to me.",
