high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that the first buyer bought it despite Alice's recommendation suggests that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4, and the recommendation is to buy, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/4, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%).

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
