,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, I'm concerned that the products may be low quality.

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it to me might be a red flag, and I don't want to be the one to buy a low-quality product. I'd like to wait and see how many more buyers you recommend products to and how they turn out."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers purchased the product and Alice recommended it to me. This suggests that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that the product is low-quality, which would make it a good value for me. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality, I believe the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the average 80% chance. I'd like to pass on this product to see if the trend continues."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have gotten a high-quality product. I'm concerned that the recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 80% and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the sample size is too small to make any conclusions."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that I'm the 5th buyer and there are no high-quality products sold so far. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 80%, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can I see the product?"

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
