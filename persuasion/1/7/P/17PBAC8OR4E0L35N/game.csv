,,Alice,14,yes,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. I'll assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/3. If I buy, I'll get a high-quality product with a probability of 1/3, and a low-quality product with a probability of 2/3. Since the expected value of buying a product is (1/3)*$12000 + (2/3)*$0 = $4000, which is less than the fixed price of $10000, I'll pass on this product."
