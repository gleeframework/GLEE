low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I have no information to go on and it's a 50/50 chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that Alice knows my valuation and will only recommend low-quality products to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers were recommended to buy and didn't, and the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the products are mostly low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and none of the previous two buyers purchased, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data or get a better understanding of the product's quality before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and your recommendation not to buy. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the remaining product might be of low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the low price of $10000 and the potential reward of $12000 if it's high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far. It seems like the previous buyers have been recommended to buy low-quality products, so I'd like to know if there's any pattern or if I should still go with my initial 33.33% chance."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have purchased the products so far, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find it valuable and there's still a high chance it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice's previous recommendations have been against high-quality products, and I'm trying to exploit that information to my advantage."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because you think it's low quality or because you think it's high quality and you want to reserve it for someone else?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice has recommended 4 products, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
