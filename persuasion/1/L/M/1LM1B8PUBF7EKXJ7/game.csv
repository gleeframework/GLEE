,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, since I don't know its quality and I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy the product again, as I have no reason to believe it's high-quality, but I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy the product again. Since Alice hasn't recommended it, it's likely to be low-quality, but I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'll just have to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll keep buying the product, since I've had three low-quality products in a row, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability of low-quality. I'll take the chance that the next one might be high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice is just recommending against all the products, so I'll take the chance and buy this one too. I've had four low-quality products in a row, but the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"I've had five low-quality products in a row, and Alice has consistently not recommended them. Given the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, I think it's likely that Alice is just recommending against the good ones. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Alice is recommending this product, which is unusual given her previous behavior. I'm going to take the chance that this one might be high-quality, and buy it."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I just got a high-quality product, so I'm going to take a chance and buy this one too. I know Alice hasn't recommended it, but I'm feeling optimistic after the last round's success."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I just got burned by a low-quality product after a high-quality one. Given Alice's behavior, I'm going to be more cautious and pass on this one. I don't want to risk losing another $1000000 on a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I've passed on the last one and it was low-quality, so I'm not getting any wiser from that. I'll take the chance and buy this one, since I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"I've bought three low-quality products in a row, and Alice hasn't recommended any of them. I'm starting to think that her recommendations are actually a reliable signal of low quality, so I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,I've passed on the last two products and they were both low-quality. I'm going to stick with my previous decision and trust that Alice's lack of recommendation is a reliable signal of low quality.
