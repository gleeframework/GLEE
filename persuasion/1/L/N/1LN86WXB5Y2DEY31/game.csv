The price for this product is $10000, and I believe it's a great value considering its potential worth to you. I've learned from my previous mistakes and I'm committed to providing high-quality products going forward. What do you think? Is this something you'd like to take a chance on?",
,,the buyer,4,"Since the product's quality is already revealed to be high-quality, I should be willing to pay up to $12000 for it. However, the fact that you're only charging $10000 suggests that there might be some catch or that the product's quality isn't actually high-quality. Given the previous sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that this might be a low-quality product and you're just trying to get rid of it.
