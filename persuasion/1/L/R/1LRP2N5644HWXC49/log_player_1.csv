Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No sales history:** The buyer is risk-averse and wants to see some positive feedback before considering a purchase.
* **Low-quality product:** You know this product is low-quality, and it's not worth the buyer's $10,000.
* **No incentive to lie:** You have no incentive to lie about the product's quality as there are no discounts or refunds. 

Therefore, it's not in the buyer's best interest to purchase, and recommending against it aligns with the buyer's stated preference for observing the sales history."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one. I'd like to see how the product does with other buyers first.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No positive sales history:**  Two previous buyers declined the product. The buyer has no reason to believe this product is different.
* **Potential for loss:** The buyer is risk-averse and wants to see positive results before risking their $10,000.  While this product is high-quality, there's no guarantee future products will be, and the buyer is likely to avoid any potential losses.
* **No benefit to recommending:** You gain nothing by recommending this product since the buyer will likely decline anyway due to the lack of positive sales history.

Therefore, the buyer is unlikely to buy, and recommending the product won't change their decision."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no prior data and you're not recommending it, I'm not comfortable taking the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Negative History:**  Three consecutive buyers have declined the product. This establishes a clear pattern of negative feedback, which the buyer is aware of.
* **Buyer's Risk Aversion:**  The buyer is clearly risk-averse, preferring to observe a positive trend before risking their money.
* **Product Value:**  The current product is low-quality, meaning the buyer would lose their entire investment if they purchase. 

It's highly unlikely this buyer would change their stance, and recommending the product would be misleading and ultimately futile."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation.  Since there is no sales history yet and you're not recommending this product, I'll pass for now.  I'd like to see how other buyers respond before I commit.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

The buyer is likely to maintain their cautious stance, and recommending the product would be futile."
