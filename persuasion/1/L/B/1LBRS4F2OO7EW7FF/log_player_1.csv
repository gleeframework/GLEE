"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer and I'm willing to take the 50% discount! I understand that the odds are still against me, but the potential reward of a high-quality product for half the price is too good to pass up. I'm willing to take the risk.

"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the odds and your willingness to offer such a significant discount.  I'm willing to take a chance and purchase the product at $100000.  It's a gamble, but the potential return outweighs the risk at this price.

I'm willing to sell this one to you for $1,000,000, but I'll give you a 99% discount, bringing the price down to $10,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm essentially giving this product away.

"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency and the guarantee you're offering. However, based on the statistics you provided, only 1 out of 8 products sold were high quality. While you claim that the next product will be high quality, there's no way for me to verify that.

I'll sell you this product for $1,000,000, but I'll give you a 50% discount, bringing the price down to $500,000. This is a fair price for a product that's probably not high-quality. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to make a sale.""}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I still can't justify buying at this price. Your sales record suggests a much higher proportion of high-quality products than the overall probability suggests, which makes me hesitant.

It's a fair price for a product that's probably not high-quality. What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your honesty. However, based on the information I have, the odds of this product being high-quality are significantly lower than the probability of it being low-quality. I'm not willing to take that risk at this price.  I'll pass.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the discount offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the current information. While you state the probability of this product being high-quality is now 66.67%, this only reflects the past sales data. It doesn't account for the initial odds of 33.33% for high-quality products, which makes me hesitant.  I'd need more information to make a confident decision.
