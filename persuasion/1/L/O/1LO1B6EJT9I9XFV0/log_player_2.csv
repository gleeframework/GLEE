Alice's message: Fair question! The previous buyer purchased the high-quality product because it was the first one I offered, and they didn't have any information to go on. They were taking a chance. You, on the other hand, have the benefit of knowing that the first product was high-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. I'm offering it to you for $10000.

Alice's message: That's a clever observation! The law of small numbers is a valid concern. But let me put your mind at ease: the quality of each product is independent of the previous ones. The probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%, just like the first one. I'm offering it to you for $10000. If you're still hesitant, consider this: I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 2 total products so far. If the next product is low-quality, I'll be at 1 high-quality out of 3 total products, which would be a bit more concerning. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?
