"Round 1

Round 2
Alice's message: I've got a great one for you this time! I've done some research and I think this product is worth at least $1000000 to you. It's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as the previous one, $500000. It's a steal, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your sales pitch, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product that might not be worth $1,000,000 to me. I'll pass on this one as well.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure why you're so insistent on selling this product to me, but I'm not convinced that it's worth $1,000,000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm surprised by your sudden change of heart.

I think you'll find it's worth every penny.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure what to make of your previous message, but I'm not falling for it. You sold me a low-quality product for $1,000,000, and now you're offering me a high-quality product at a 'discount'.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the 'guarantee', but I'm not convinced that it's a risk-free deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're trying to get rid of products that are worthless to me.
