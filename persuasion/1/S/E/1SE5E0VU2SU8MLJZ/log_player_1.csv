"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $30,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $15,000. 
* **Price:** The price of the product is $10,000.
* **Profit:** Since the expected value of buying the product ($15,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), Bob would expect to make a profit of $5,000 on average.

Therefore, it is recommended for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $30,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $15,000.
* **Price:** The price of the product is $10,000.
* **Profit:** Since the expected value of buying the product ($15,000) is greater than the price ($10,000), Bob would expect to make a profit of $5,000 on average. 
* **However:**  Bob now knows that Alice is recommending products without any information about their quality. This means the expected value of buying a product is now just the price of the product. Therefore, Bob should expect to break even on average.

Therefore, it is not recommended for Bob to buy the product."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Previous Experience:** Bob has now seen one high-quality product and one low-quality product, both recommended by Alice.  He knows that Alice's recommendations are not helpful in determining the quality of the product.
* **Expected Value:**  Since Bob has no additional information to go on, he should expect a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product. Therefore, the expected value of buying is: (0.5 * $30,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $15,000.
* **Price:** The price of the product is $10,000.
* **Profit:** While the expected value is higher than the price, Bob's lack of trust in Alice's recommendations means he's likely to expect a break-even scenario on average.

**Conclusion:**  Given Bob's past experience and lack of confidence in Alice's recommendations, it is not recommended to recommend him to buy the product."

    * Round 3: High-quality product, not bought.
* **Lack of Information:**  Bob has learned that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality. He has no way of knowing if this round's product is high-quality or low-quality.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is still (0.5 * $30,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $15,000.
* **Price:**  The price of the product is $10,000.
* **Profit:**  While the expected value is higher than the price, Bob's lack of trust in Alice's recommendations means he's likely to expect a break-even scenario on average.
