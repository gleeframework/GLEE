The truth is, the probability of a high-quality product being selected for each buyer is indeed lower than 50%. However, it's not because of any bias or manipulation on my part. It's simply because the products are randomly selected, and the probability of a high-quality product being selected is 50% overall.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not convinced that the fact that the previous two products were high-quality is enough to change the underlying probability of this new product being high-quality.
