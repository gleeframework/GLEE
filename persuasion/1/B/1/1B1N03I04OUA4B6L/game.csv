,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm a pioneer, after all!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'd like to see the product's quality for myself."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendation is not reliable, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Can you give me more information about the previous sales? How many total products were sold, and what was the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I would like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/2, but since only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 2 products, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 1/2. I would like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not buying based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to estimate the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold, the probability of a product being high-quality is 1/3. However, I'm also considering the fact that you're not recommending it, which might indicate that you have some information that I don't. But I'm going to take a chance and buy it anyway."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that she has already sold 4 products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as you don't recommend it. I'd like to know the updated statistics after I pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be due to the fact that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy, which could indicate a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, which aligns with the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 4 purchases. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and still get my $1000000 back."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold, to help me make a more informed decision in the future."
