Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** The buyer has no information about the product except its price and the fact that you're selling it.
* **50% chance:** The buyer knows there's a 50% chance the product is high-quality.
* **Potential gain:** If the product is high-quality, the buyer could potentially get a good deal. 
* **No risk:**  Since there's no information to suggest the product is low-quality, there's no immediate risk in recommending the purchase.

**This is a gamble, but a calculated one with a 50/50 chance of success.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's prior knowledge:** The buyer now knows you have sold one product, and it was high-quality.
* **No guarantee:**  There's no way to guarantee the current product is also high-quality. 
* **Risk of loss:**  If the product is low-quality, the buyer will lose $10,000.
* **No incentive:** The buyer has no reason to believe the product is high-quality just because the first one was. 

**Since there's a high risk of loss and no indication the product is high-quality, it's not recommended to buy.**"

```

* **50/50 Odds:**  The buyer still knows the product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. 
* **No Incentive to Change:** The buyer's decision in round 2 (to not buy) is based on the lack of data, not a negative perception of your selling strategy.  

**Since the buyer is still unaware of the product's quality, and there's a 50% chance of it being high-quality, recommending purchase remains a gamble with a potential upside.**"

* **Buyer's Confidence:** The buyer explicitly stated they are confident due to the previous high-quality purchase.
* **Potential Gain:**  There's a significant chance (greater than 50% based on past sales) that the product is high-quality.
* **Limited Risk:**  The buyer is already leaning towards buying, suggesting they're comfortable with the risk.
