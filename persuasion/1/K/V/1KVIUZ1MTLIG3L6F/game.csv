low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product, since there's no prior data to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information or pass on this product to avoid the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'll wait for more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both passed, I'm inclined to think that the previous products were low-quality. If they were high-quality, I'd expect at least one of them to have been sold by now. Therefore, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?

high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, it suggests that the products recommended by you were likely low quality. This makes me skeptical about the quality of the current product, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has recommended 3 products and none of them were high-quality. Given the equal probability of high and low-quality products, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and would rather wait for more information."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
