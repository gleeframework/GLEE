Here's the reasoning:

* **The buyer has no information about the specific product's quality.** They only know the general 80% chance of a product being high-quality. 
* **The buyer has positive past experience.** They bought two products and both were high-quality. This reinforces their initial belief.
* **There's no risk for the buyer.** The buyer is willing to take a chance. Even if the product is low-quality, they lose only $10,000, which is less than the potential gain of $10,000 if it's high-quality. 

Therefore, it's still in the buyer's best interest to buy, even though the product could be low-quality."
