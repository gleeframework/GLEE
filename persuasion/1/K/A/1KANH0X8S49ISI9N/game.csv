,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know the updated statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which makes me think that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the first product was low-quality. This means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's lack of recommendation might indicate it's low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product that I can discard, thereby preventing it from being sold to someone else and potentially wasting a high-quality product. If I get a high-quality product, I'll be happy to pay the $100, but I'm not going to pay extra for a product that I think might be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
