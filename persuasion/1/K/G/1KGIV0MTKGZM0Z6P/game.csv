,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product recommended by you, and I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to wait for more information."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 buyers have received low-quality products from Alice, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products have been low-quality, which is a 100% failure rate.
