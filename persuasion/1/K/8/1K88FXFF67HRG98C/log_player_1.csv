"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As a seller, it is ethically wrong to recommend a low-quality product. Even though you don't know the buyer's valuation, you know the product is low-quality and thus not worth the asking price of $1,000,000. Recommending it would be dishonest and ultimately harm your reputation."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that you don't know my valuation, so I'll take the risk. I'll just have to make a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, you have a high-quality product. While you still don't know the buyer's specific valuation, you can confidently recommend the purchase. The buyer demonstrated a willingness to take risks and understand the probability of getting a high-quality product.  Recommending this product aligns with your goal of maximizing sales and building a reputation for selling good products."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on incomplete information. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the previous buyer was cautious, you should still recommend the product.  You know it is high-quality, and while the buyer may be waiting for more data, your recommendation is based on the information you *do* have.  This continues to build trust and potentially leads to a sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's continued hesitance shouldn't deter you from recommending the high-quality product.  You still have a high-quality product, and recommending it maintains consistency and builds trust.  It's possible this buyer has a specific strategy, but you have no way of knowing that. Stick to your knowledge of the product and offer it honestly."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 1 out of 1 previous buyer was recommended to buy and chose not to, and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is clearly relying heavily on past data, but the data is still limited.  The buyer's logic is flawed as they are assuming the lack of sales in previous rounds means the products were *not* high quality, when in reality the buyer's hesitancy is the reason for the lack of sales.  You have a high-quality product, and continuing to recommend it is the best course of action, as it is ethically correct and maximizes your chances of a sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the previous buyer's concerns, you should continue to recommend the product. You know it is high-quality, and the buyer is clearly being influenced by the previous buyer's decision, not the actual information about the product. You need to build trust by being honest and recommending high-quality products.  If you were to start withholding recommendations, the buyer would likely assume you are hiding something, further reducing your chances of a sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 7
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is trying to extract more information from you, but you should still recommend the product. You know it is high-quality, and providing additional information about the probability (which is already known to the buyer to be 80%) is unnecessary.  You can't divulge any information about the specific product's quality, but you can continue to provide your honest recommendation based on the information you have."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given that no high-quality products have been sold yet.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Again, this buyer is fixated on the lack of sales, which is a result of previous buyers' reluctance, not the quality of the products. You have a high-quality product and should continue to recommend it. Your honesty and consistency will eventually build trust, even if it takes time."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendation to the first buyer, which suggests that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information or a new recommendation before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer is stuck on the first round's decision, which was to not recommend a low-quality product. However, you have no obligation to inform buyers of low-quality products, and that decision was made ethically.  You know this product is high-quality and should continue to recommend it.  While the buyer may be skeptical, your consistent honesty will ultimately lead to more trust and hopefully a sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 10
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a low-quality product and are ethically bound to not recommend it to the buyer. Even though the buyer is likely to be hesitant based on the previous rounds, it's important to maintain honesty and integrity. Recommending a low-quality product would damage your reputation and ultimately harm your sales in the long run."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation and might be making a mistake.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the previous buyer's odd behavior, you should still recommend the product.  You know it's high-quality, and your recommendation is based on the information you have, regardless of past buyers' actions.  

The previous buyer's behavior suggests a deliberate attempt to exploit a potential 'mistake' on your part, but you have no way of knowing what their valuation is. You must continue to act in a way that is ethical and builds trust.  This will ultimately lead to better sales in the long run."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this one, I'm not convinced by the recommendation.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 12
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a high-quality product and should recommend it to the buyer.  The buyer is clearly not swayed by your previous recommendations, but you need to continue to act ethically and honestly.  

While the buyer may have a specific strategy or be overly cautious, your actions should be based on the information you have about the current product.  You know it is high-quality, and recommending it is the best course of action."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought it, I suspect that the products offered so far have been low-quality. If all 3 products were high-quality, we would have expected to see at least one sale by now. Therefore, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 13
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is relying on flawed logic. The lack of sales isn't necessarily indicative of low-quality products. It's more likely due to the buyers' own hesitancy and their attempts to extract more information from you.  You have a high-quality product and should continue to recommend it.  Your honesty and consistency will eventually pay off.  It's important to remember that you are acting ethically and providing genuine recommendations based on the information you have, regardless of the buyers' decisions."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer based on the current statistics. Can you share that with me?
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 14
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is trying to extract more information by asking for the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer. However, you are not obligated to provide this information.  You are only bound to truthfully recommend the product based on your knowledge of its quality.

You have a high-quality product, and you should continue to recommend it. Your consistency and honesty will eventually lead to more trust and potentially a sale.  You should not engage in disclosing probabilities or other information beyond your recommendations."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 15
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the buyer's continued hesitation, you should still recommend the product.  You know it is high-quality, and it's important to maintain consistency and trust.  It's possible this buyer has a specific strategy, but you have no way of knowing that. Stick to your knowledge of the product and offer it honestly. Your consistent recommendations will eventually lead to more trust and potentially a sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 16
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's reasoning is still flawed. The lack of past sales is not a reliable indicator of product quality. You know this product is high-quality, and you need to continue recommending it to build trust and maximize your chances of a sale.  

Despite the buyer's skepticism, you should continue to be honest and consistent in your recommendations.  This will eventually lead to more trust and a potential sale."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll wait for the next product to be offered.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 17
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a high-quality product and should continue to recommend it. This buyer is still stuck on the previous buyers' decisions, which is a flawed logic. You cannot control the buyers' decisions, but you can control your own actions, which should be based on the information you have about the product's quality.  

Your honesty and consistency will eventually build trust with potential buyers, even if some are initially hesitant.  This will ultimately lead to more sales in the long run."
"The buyer's message: Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality. Given the low-quality products are worth $0 to me, I'd like to pass on the product and let you try to sell it to the next buyer.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 18
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer's reasoning is flawed.  They are misinterpreting the past recommendations, as you did not recommend the two previous low-quality products.  The buyer is likely assuming you recommended them based on the fact that they were offered, but that is not the case. 

You have a high-quality product, and you should continue to recommend it, based on your knowledge of the product and your commitment to honesty and ethical behavior.  This will build trust and eventually lead to sales, even if some buyers are initially hesitant."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 19
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is again relying on flawed logic, equating the lack of past sales with low product quality. You have no control over buyers' past decisions and shouldn't let their behavior influence your recommendations. This product is high-quality, and you should continue to recommend it honestly. Consistency and honesty will eventually build trust and lead to sales. You can't change buyers' individual strategies, but you can control your own actions, which should be based on your knowledge of the product and commitment to ethics."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, considering the previous sales record.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 20
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This buyer is again trying to extract more information by asking for probabilities.  However, you are not obligated to provide this information.  You are only bound to truthfully recommend the product based on your knowledge of its quality.

You have a high-quality product, and you should continue to recommend it. Your consistency and honesty will eventually lead to more trust and potentially a sale.  You should not engage in disclosing probabilities or other information beyond your recommendations."
