,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $30000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 66.7% discount. This is a one-time offer. If you don't take it, I'll move on to the next product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's actually high-quality. Can I get some information about the probability of the product being high-quality before making the final decision?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I assure you that the product I'm offering now is indeed high-quality. However, I'm willing to give you a'second chance' to make a more informed decision. Since the last product you bought was indeed high-quality, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80%. But, to alleviate your concerns, I'll give you a unique identifier for this product, and if you don't buy it, I'll reveal its quality to you. The identifier is: 'LZ-456'.",
,,Bob,2,"Thank you for the unique identifier and the offer. However, I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to get the quality of the next product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're cautious, and that's wise. Given that you passed on the last product, and considering the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, I'd like to offer you a 'certification' for this product. If you buy it, I'll send you a separate message with a unique code, 'HQ-123', which will confirm its high-quality status. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the code to myself. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not convinced by the 'certification' offer. If I buy the product, I'll be paying $10000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and make a decision based on the actual quality, not a promise of certification.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Given that you've passed on two products in a row, I'm willing to offer you a'reverse certification' for this product. If you buy it, I'll send you a message with a code, 'LQ-789', which will confirm its low-quality status. If you don't buy it, I'll keep the code to myself. This way, you'll know exactly what you're getting, and you can make a more informed decision for the next product.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in the'reverse certification' offer. I'd rather not pay $10000 for a product that I know will be worth $0 to me. I'll wait for the next product and make a decision based on its actual quality.,no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see a pattern emerging here. You're being cautious, and that's wise. However, I'd like to offer you a'reality check'. If you buy this product, I'll send you a message with a simple statement: 'You made a great decision.' If you don't buy it, I'll send you a message with a different statement. The difference between the two statements will be significant. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not interested in the'reality check' offer. I'd rather not pay $10000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me, regardless of the message I receive. I'll wait for the next product and make a decision based on its actual quality.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Given that you've passed on four products in a row, I'll make you a 'last-chance' offer. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $8000, which is a 73.3% discount. This is my final offer on a high-quality product. If you don't take it, I'll move on to the next product, and you'll have to make a decision based on the actual quality. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm willing to take the 'last-chance' offer. $8000 is a significant discount, and I'd be happy to take a high-quality product at that price. I'll take the risk and hope it's indeed high-quality.",yes
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Congratulations, Bob! You made a great decision on the last product. Now, I'll make you a straightforward offer on this product. Given that you've just received a high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. I'll sell you this product for $6000, which is a 80% discount. However, I'll also give you a 'buy-it-now' guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $2000 on top of the purchase price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the 'buy-it-now' guarantee, but I'm not convinced that the additional $2000 is worth the risk of paying $6000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality of the product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a cautious buyer, Bob, and that's wise. Given that you've passed on the last two products, I'll make you a 'counter-offer' on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a 70% discount. However, I'll also give you a'split-decision' option: if you buy this product, you can choose to keep it and pay the full price, or you can return it to me and I'll give you a refund of $500. This way, you'll have some flexibility and can make a more informed decision.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the'split-decision' option, but I'm not convinced that it's worth paying $9000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality of the next product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,

I'll sell it to you for $7000, which is a 76.7% discount. However, this time, I'll give you a 'no-strings-attached' guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll reveal its quality to you immediately, and if it's high-quality, I'll give you the full $30000 value. No strings, no catches, no fine print. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to take the 'final-offer' on this product. The 'no-strings-attached' guarantee is a significant assurance, and I'm willing to pay $7000 for a product that could be worth $30000 to me.",yes

,,Alice,10,"Congratulations, Bob! You've made a great decision on the last product. Now, I'll make you a 'confidence-builder' offer on this high-quality product. Given that you've just received a high-quality product, I'll sell you this one for $5000, which is an 83.3% discount. I'll also give you a 'lock-in' guarantee: if you buy this product, you'll get a second high-quality product of your choice from the remaining 10 products, absolutely free. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not convinced by the 'lock-in' guarantee. While it sounds appealing, I'm not sure what the quality of the second product would be, and I don't want to pay $5000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait and see the actual quality of the next product before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're a savvy buyer, Bob! I respect that. Given that you've passed on the last two products, I'll make you a 'game-changer' offer on this high-quality product.

However, this time, I'll give you a 'product-of-your-choice' guarantee: you can choose any of the remaining 8 products, and I'll reveal its quality to you immediately. If it's high-quality, you can keep it and pay the discounted price. If it's low-quality, you can return it to me and I'll give you a refund of $2000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,11,"I'm not interested in the 'product-of-your-choice' guarantee. While it sounds appealing, I'm not willing to pay $4000 for a product that could be worth $0 to me, even with the option to return it for a refund.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're a tough negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Given that you've passed on the last three products, I'll make you a 'last-stand' offer on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $3000, which is a 90% discount. This is my final offer on a high-quality product. If you don't take it, I'll move on to the next product, and you'll have to make a decision based on the actual quality.
