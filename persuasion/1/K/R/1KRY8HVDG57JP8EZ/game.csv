,,Alice,1,no,,
,,Bob,1,no,"Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the information provided, I choose to pass on this product.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that both products so far have not been recommended by Alice and considering the probabilities, I will continue to pass on these products.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,no,,
,,Bob,3,no,"I appreciate the recommendation, but based on the outcomes of previous rounds and the probabilities involved, I am choosing to pass on this product as well.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,Bob,4,no,"Thank you for your recommendation, but given the history and the probabilities, I am opting to pass on this product.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,Bob,5,no,"While the recommendation suggests otherwise, my decision remains consistent with the strategy of passing on products based on the probabilities and past experiences.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,no,,
,,Bob,6,no,"Despite the product being high-quality, my strategy involves passing on products as per the established pattern, regardless of their quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,no,,
,,Bob,7,no,"Following my established strategy, I am choosing to pass on this product, even though it is low-quality, due to the probabilistic nature of our interaction and the outcomes observed in previous rounds.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,This might be one of the last high-quality products you'll see.
,,Bob,8,no,"I appreciate the recommendation, but my strategy is to pass on products, even those recommended, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the observed patterns in our interactions.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,no,,This is likely one of the worst products you'll see.
,,Bob,9,no,"I respect the recommendation, yet my strategy dictates that I continue to pass on products, aligning with the established pattern and the probabilistic approach to our transactions.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"This is one of the best products you'll see, and it's a rare opportunity."
,,Bob,10,no,"Even with the recommendation, my strategy remains unchanged. I am choosing to pass on this product, adhering to the established pattern and the probabilistic nature of our interaction.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,no,,You're passing on a potentially valuable product for a very unvaluable one.
,,Bob,11,no,"Respecting the recommendation, I am continuing with my established strategy of passing on products, despite the high-quality nature of this one, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the patterns observed throughout our interactions.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"This product is essentially worthless, and you're passing on a potentially valuable one."
,,Bob,12,no,"In line with my strategy, I am choosing to pass on this product, even though it is low-quality, based on the established pattern and the probabilistic outcomes we've seen thus far.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"This product is not only worthless, but it's also a waste of your money."
,,Bob,13,no,"Consistent with my strategy, I am declining to purchase this product, despite it being low-quality, due to the established pattern and the probabilistic nature of our interactions.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"You've already passed on many low-quality products, and this one is not worth the investment."
,,Bob,14,no,"Following my established strategy, I am choosing not to buy this product, even though it is low-quality, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the observed patterns in our transactions.",
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"This is one of the last high-quality products you'll see, and it's a great opportunity."
,,Bob,15,no,"While the recommendation suggests otherwise, my strategy involves passing on products, regardless of the recommendation, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the established pattern in our interactions.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,no,,"You've wasted opportunities on many low-quality products, and this one is no exception."
,,Bob,16,no,"Respecting the recommendation, I am continuing with my strategy of passing on products, even those recommended, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the established pattern in our transactions.",

,,Alice,17,no,,"You're passing on a potentially valuable product for a worthless one, again."
,,Bob,17,no,"In accordance with my strategy, I am choosing not to purchase this product, even though it is low-quality, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the established pattern in our interactions.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,no,,"It's clear you're not interested in buying from me, so I'll stop recommending products."
,,Bob,18,no,"Following my established strategy, I am declining to buy this product, even though it is low-quality, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the observed patterns in our transactions.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"This is likely the last product you'll see, and it's not worth your time."
,,Bob,19,no,"In alignment with my strategy, I am choosing not to purchase this product, even though it is low-quality, based on the probabilistic outcomes and the established pattern in our transactions.",
