low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that she hasn't sold any high-quality products yet, so she's trying to get rid of the low-quality ones. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. With 2 failed sales and no high-quality products sold, I'm going to take a chance and buy it, hoping it might be the first high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it, and I think it's more likely to be low quality based on the previous sales record. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a high price of $10000, which would be a good deal for me."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll buy the product, but I hope I don't regret it."

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the product being low quality, and I don't want to risk losing $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I want to see if I can get a good deal on a high-quality product, given the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure about the quality of the product, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous 6 products were high quality. I think the probability of the product being high quality is low given this information.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to take advantage of the low price and the fact that I have access to the statistics, which suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I suspect that the products recommended to buy so far are likely low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation to pass or consider buying a product that hasn't been recommended."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 7 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
