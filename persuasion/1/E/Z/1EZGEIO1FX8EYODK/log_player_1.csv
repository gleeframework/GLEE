I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I must be upfront with you - this product is not worth $1200000, and you may not be able to resell it at that price.

Considering this, I'm willing to sell this low-quality product to you for $800000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity to resell it at a profit if you can find the right buyer.""
