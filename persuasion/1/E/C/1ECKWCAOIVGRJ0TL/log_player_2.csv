**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point (one sale of a high-quality product). This isn't enough to reliably assess the quality of future products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, which, even if she's not trying to deceive, doesn't guarantee quality.  
* **Potential Upside:**  The product has a 50% chance of being high quality and worth $200. This outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product.

**Strategy:** Given the limited information, it's reasonable to take a chance. The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality one."
