,,Alice,1,"This product is one of the first 20 products I'm offering for sale. Out of the first 1 products I've sold, 0 are high-quality. I'm not sure how much you value high-quality products, but I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't get a chance to buy from me again at this price.",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the opportunity. I understand the risk involved with the low-quality chance, but given the unique offer and the lack of previous data, I am willing to take a chance on this product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was a low-quality one. That's all I have to go on. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. If you're interested, this could be a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, given the low-quality product I sold earlier.",

,,Alice,3,"You're the third buyer to see my products. Out of the 2 products I've sold so far, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Given the split between high-quality and low-quality products, it's possible that I'm just experiencing a random streak. However, it's also possible that I'm selling more low-quality products than usual. You'll have to decide whether the risk is worth it.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information. Based on the statistics provided, I believe the risk is worth it given the potential value of a high-quality product. I would like to purchase the current product.",yes

,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer to see my products. Out of the 4 products I've sold so far, 3 are high-quality and 1 is low-quality. Given this ratio, it's likely that most of my products are high-quality. However, I want to caution you that I've only sold 5 products in total, so the sample size is still relatively small.

However, I want to highlight that the last product I sold was low-quality, which might indicate that I've been due for a correction in my sales ratio. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but I want to make sure you're aware of the recent change in my sales history.",

I want to be upfront with you: the recent streak of high-quality products might be a coincidence, but it's also possible that I've been selling more high-quality products than usual. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Consider the fact that the probability of a product being low-quality is now 16.7%, and weigh that against the potential value of a high-quality product.",

,,Alice,8,"You're the eighth buyer to see my products. Out of the 7 products I've sold so far, 6 are high-quality and 1 is low-quality. However, the last two products I sold were both low-quality, which suggests that my sales ratio might be reverting to the mean. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is now 85.7%, but I want to caution you that I've had a bit of a correction in my sales history recently.",

Given the recent streak of high-quality products, I want to ask you to consider the following: if I'm selling 90% high-quality products, I should have sold at least 9 high-quality products out of the first 10 by now. Since I've only sold 9, it's possible that I've been lucky so far. I'm offering this one to you for $1000000. Think carefully about the odds and the potential value of a high-quality product.",
