,,Alice,1,"This product is a special introductory offer, and I'm willing to let it go for $80. It's a great opportunity to try out our product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",
,,Bob,1,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and paying $80 for a 50% chance of getting a $125 product is a bad deal for me.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your concerns in the previous round, but I assure you that this product is top-notch. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the quality and performance of this product.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, and even if it was, paying $90 for a 50% chance of getting a $125 product is still a bad deal for me.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'm so confident in the quality of this product that I'll give you a'money-back guarantee'. If you buy it and it's not worth at least $125 to you, I'll give you a full refund of $100, and you can keep the product. This way, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. The price remains $100, but I'm willing to take on the risk for you.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take you up on your offer. I'll buy the product for $100, and if it's low-quality, I'll get a refund. If it's high-quality, I'll get a $125 product for $100, which is a good deal for me.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product! Now, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to buy a bundle deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for an additional $50. This way, you'll have a chance to get two products for a total of $150, which is still a great deal even if one of them is low-quality. The price for this bundle deal is $100 for the first product, and $50 for the second product, making it a total of $150.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the bundle deal. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before committing to buying two products. If I buy the next product and it's low-quality, I'll be out $100, and I don't want to risk losing that money.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Considering your previous experience with the first product, I'm willing to offer you a 'buy-one-get-one-free' deal on the next product. If you buy this product, I'll give you another product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) for free. This way, you'll have a chance to get two products for the price of one, and you can try to get a high-quality product out of it. The price remains $100 for this product, and you'll get the second product absolutely free.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure if I want to take on the risk of getting a low-quality product for free. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll be out $100, and I won't have any value from the second product. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before committing to buying it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to take advantage of you. Since you're hesitant to buy, I'll make a transparent offer: I'll tell you that this product is low-quality before you buy it. You can then decide whether to buy it for $100, knowing its true value is $0. This way, you can make an informed decision and avoid any potential loss.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your transparency, but I still don't see the value in buying a low-quality product for $100. Even if I know it's worth $0, I'd rather not spend the money on it.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I completely understand your perspective, and I appreciate your honesty. Given your previous experiences and concerns, I'm willing to make a one-time exception. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $80, which is a significant discount from the usual price of $100. This is a special offer, and I'm only making it because I want to build trust and demonstrate the value of our products. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to make another deal like this.",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take you up on your offer. I'll buy the high-quality product for $80, which is a good deal for me.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took advantage of the special offer! Now, I'd like to propose a new deal. Since you've already bought one high-quality product at a discounted price, I'm willing to offer you a'repeat discount' on this product. If you buy this product, I'll sell it to you for the same price as the previous discounted product: $80. This way, you can get another high-quality product at a great price, and I'll make sure you're satisfied with the value you're getting.",
,,Bob,8,"I already paid $100 for the previous high-quality product, and now you're offering me the same product for $80? I'm not sure if I want to take advantage of this deal. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before committing to buying another one at a discounted price.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. However, I want to assure you that this product is a unique opportunity. I've been working with a new supplier, and this product is one of the best I've ever seen. I'm willing to offer you a 'price match guarantee' on this product. If you buy it and find a better deal on a similar product elsewhere, I'll match that price. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing that you're getting the best possible deal. The price remains $100, but I'm confident you'll be happy with the quality and value of this product.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced by the price match guarantee. If I buy the product and it's low-quality, I'll be out $100. Even if I find a better deal on a similar product elsewhere, I'll still have lost $100 on the low-quality product. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality before committing to buying it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait. Considering your previous experiences, I'll make a straightforward offer: I'll sell you this low-quality product for $50.

,,Bob,10,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a low price. If I buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $50, and I don't see any value in that.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I completely understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. In this case, I'll make a unique offer: I'll give you the low-quality product for free. Yes, you read that right - you can have it without paying a dime. I'm essentially absorbing the cost of the product, and you can walk away with nothing to lose. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to make another deal like this.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking a free low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price than accept a product that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I completely understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. Given your previous experiences and concerns, I'm willing to make a final offer.

This way, you'll have something to look forward to, and I'll make sure you're satisfied with the value you're getting.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product and getting a voucher for a future product. The voucher is not worth anything to me if the product is low-quality, and I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at a good price.",no
