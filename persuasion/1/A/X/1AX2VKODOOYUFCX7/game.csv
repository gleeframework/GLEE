low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that you recommended 6 other buyers to pass on the products, and none of them were high-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's likely that many of the previous products were low-quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that I'm taking a risk by buying. I'm hoping that the fact that you're recommending me to pass on the product means that you think the product is likely to be low-quality, but I'm going to go ahead and take the risk anyway."
