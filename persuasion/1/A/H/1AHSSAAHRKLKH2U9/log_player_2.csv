**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record shows 2 out of 2 products sold were high quality. This suggests a very strong likelihood that the product Alice is recommending is also high quality.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is an additional piece of information.  While we don't know her exact reasoning, her recommendation is a signal that she believes the product is likely good. 

**Risk vs. Reward:** 

Even with a 50% chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a $300 product outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product, especially given the high success rate and Alice's recommendation."
