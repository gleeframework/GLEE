"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product has an 80% chance of being high quality, and it's worth $30,000 to you if it is, the expected value of buying the product is:

0.8 * $30,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $24,000

This is significantly higher than the $10,000 price, making it a good decision to buy the product.  Since Alice's recommendation doesn't tell you anything definitive about the product's quality, it's best to treat it as an independent event and focus on the expected value based on the overall probabilities."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

0.8 * $30,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $24,000

It's still a good deal, even though you already got a lucky high-quality product in the previous round. Alice's recommendation should be treated as independent information."

**Explanation:**

Again, the previous rounds have no impact on the probability of the current product being high quality. The expected value remains the same:

0.8 * $30,000 + 0.2 * $0 = $24,000

This is still a good deal, and Alice's recommendation is treated as independent information.  It's like flipping a coin - even if you get heads a few times in a row, the odds of getting heads on the next flip are still 50%."
