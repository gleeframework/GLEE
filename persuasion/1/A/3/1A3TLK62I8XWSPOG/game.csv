,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the quality of the product is unknown to you, but I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the price, considering the potential value of a high-quality product.",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product, hoping to get a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your caution, Bob. I want to assure you that I'm offering a fair price of $10000 for this product. Since you're not familiar with the quality, I'd like to highlight that the price is a one-time offer, and you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Additionally, I'm willing to provide a 10% discount if you're willing to make a decision now, but that's the only concession I can make.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to take the risk. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope to get a high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. I want to reiterate that the price remains at $10000, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. However, I'd like to share some information that might help you make a decision. Out of the first three products I've offered, two have been low-quality. This might suggest that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the overall probability. I'm willing to give you a'second chance' to buy this product, and if it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a 'free' product of your choice from the remaining 17 products. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product, considering the information you've shared. If it's low-quality, I'll take you up on your offer for a 'free' product from the remaining ones.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Congratulations on your decision, Bob! I'm glad you took the chance. Now, let's move on to the next product. I want to acknowledge that you've had a taste of success with the previous product, and I'm confident that this one will be just as valuable. However, I also want to remind you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a 'guarantee' that this product is high-quality, but I'll need you to pay $12000 for it. If it's indeed high-quality, you'll get the full value of $40000, and if it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $12000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not convinced by the 'guarantee' offer. I think it's too expensive, and I'd rather wait for the next product and take my chances.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, Bob. I want to offer you a different approach. Since you've already had one high-quality product, I'll give you a 'discount' on this one. I'll sell it to you for $12000, which is 30% of its true value. However, I'll also give you a 'lottery ticket' for the next product. If you buy this one and the next one is high-quality, you'll get to buy the next product for $0. This way, you'll effectively get two high-quality products for the price of one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm intrigued by the 'lottery ticket' offer. I'll take the risk and buy the product for $12000, hoping to get a high-quality one and then get the next one for free.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on your decision, Bob! I'm glad you took the chance. Now, let's talk about the next product. You've already won a 'lottery ticket' for a free product, so I'll make this one a 'free' offer as well. However, I'll need you to buy this product first, and then you can claim your free product from the next round. I'll sell it to you for $10000, and you can consider it a 'placeholder' for the free product you'll get later. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the 'free' offer, but I'm only paying $10000 for the placeholder product, hoping to get the next one for free.",yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I respect that. Since you've already paid $10000 for the placeholder product, I'll give you a 'bonus' on this one. I'll sell it to you for $12000, but I'll also throw in a 'bonus' product from the next round. If you buy this product, you'll get to choose between two products from the next round, and you can keep one of them for free. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",

,,Alice,8,"You're playing it safe, Bob. I respect that. Since you've already had a few high-quality products, I'll make a 'bold' offer. I'll sell this product to you for $9000, and I'll also give you a'veto' power on the next product. If you buy this one and the next product is low-quality, you can choose to reject it and I'll give you a full refund of $9000. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",

You've got the'veto' power, so you can exercise it if you're not satisfied with this product. However, I'll make a 'last-chance' offer. I'll sell this product to you for $8000, and I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you'll get a high-quality product from the next round. If you buy this product, you can exercise your'veto' power if this one is low-quality, and you'll still get the high-quality product from the next round. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",

I'll sell this product to you for $6000, and you can consider it a 'bonus' to your collection.

,,Alice,11,"You're playing it smart, Bob. I respect that. Since you've already got the 'golden ticket' guaranteeing a high-quality product from the next round, I'll make a 'final offer' on this one. I'll sell it to you for $5000, and I'll throw in a 'consolation prize' - a 10% discount on the high-quality product you'll get from the next round, courtesy of your 'golden ticket'. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product now.",
