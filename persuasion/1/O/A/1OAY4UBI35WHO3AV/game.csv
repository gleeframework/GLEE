,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the outcome of the first sale to get a better understanding of the product quality distribution."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, as the potential reward is worth it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your previous sales record. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, considering that 2 out of 2 buyers have received the recommendation to buy, it's likely that Alice has some information that I don't have. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and not give Alice any information about my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, but I want to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see a more balanced sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 4 transactions, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. The probability of a high-quality product is 80%, but the fact that none have been sold yet suggests that Alice may be trying to sell low-quality products to the first few buyers. I'd rather wait for more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased since she knows the quality of the product and is trying to sell it to me. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, it suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products being sold. I'll wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, suggesting a high likelihood of low-quality products being recommended. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers, who had Alice's recommendations, purchased the products, but none of them were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm starting to suspect that the products recommended for purchase are more likely to be low-quality. I'll wait for a chance to buy a product that hasn't been recommended for purchase yet."
