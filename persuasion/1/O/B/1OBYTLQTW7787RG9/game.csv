,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I'm the first buyer and there's no data to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm curious to see if I can infer the quality of the product or the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and the statistics suggest a higher likelihood of a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous sales record, which shows 0 high-quality products sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than the 33.33% chance I was initially told. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold based on the statistics. Can you provide the probability?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, I'd like to calculate the probability that the remaining products are low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 products, which means the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. Your lack of recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, which would be a good outcome for me. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $100, which is a good deal for me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous sales record shows 0 high-quality products have been sold, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice is recommending it, which might indicate it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the products sold so far are low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product, hoping it has a higher chance of being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low sales record so far?"
