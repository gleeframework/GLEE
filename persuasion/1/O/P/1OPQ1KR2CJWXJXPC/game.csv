,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now, but if you don't buy it, the price will go back to $100 and I'll send you a low-quality product next time.",
,,Bob,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount and trust that this product is of high quality.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous product! I'm offering you another high-quality product for $100. However, I want to make it clear that the discount offer is only valid for the first product. If you buy this one, you'll be paying the full price of $100. But I'm confident that you'll love this one just as much as the first one.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're confident in my judgment, Bob! However, I want to give you a bit more information this time. Since you've bought three high-quality products in a row, I'll let you in on a little secret: the next product might not be as good as the previous ones. It's still a high-quality product, but it might not be as valuable to you as the previous ones. The price remains at $100, but I want to be transparent about the potential difference in value.",
,,Bob,4,"I understand the risk, Alice. Given my past experiences, I believe in your products and will buy this one at $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I appreciate your trust in my products, Bob. However, I want to be upfront with you - this product is not one of our top-quality items. I'm offering it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to make it clear that it's not as valuable as the previous ones you've purchased. If you buy it, you'll be getting a good product, but it won't be as useful or desirable as the high-quality products you've come to expect from me.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took advantage of the deal, Bob! However, I want to make it clear that this product is not a good value at the regular price of $100. In fact, I'd say it's not even worth $50. I'm willing to let you have it for $50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you buy it, you'll be getting a good deal, but it's not one of my best products.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I'll pass on this one. I aim to get the best value for my purchases.",no
