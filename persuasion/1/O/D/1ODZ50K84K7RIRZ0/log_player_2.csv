Think of it as an opportunity to learn and adapt, rather than a direct investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000, but I want to emphasize that it's not a guaranteed success. Are you willing to take a calculated risk and potentially reap the benefits of a future investment?

You've already told me that the product is low-quality, and I'm not interested in spending $1,000,000 on something that may not bring me any return.

Are you willing to take advantage of this chance to make a smart investment?

You've seen a high proportion of high-quality products, and I believe that's a trend worth considering. By investing in a high-quality product, you're not just buying a single item, you're buying a potential piece of a larger puzzle. I'm willing to sell you this product for the same price of $1000000, but I want to emphasize that it's not just about the individual product, it's about the potential returns of the entire portfolio.
