,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you were able to take advantage of the deal in Round 2! As for this product, I want to be transparent with you. I've already offered you a high-quality product at a discounted price, and you took it. Now, I'm offering you another opportunity to buy a product at the same price of $100. I understand that the previous product was low-quality, but I'm willing to offer you a'make-up' deal. If you buy this product, I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $50, which will make the effective price even lower. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer such a deal again.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the transparency, but I'm not convinced by the'make-up' deal. I've already gotten a great deal on the high-quality product in Round 2, and I'm not sure what the quality of this product is. I'd like to know its quality before making a decision.",no

I want to be upfront with you and acknowledge that it's not the best value for the price. However, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and offer you a refund of $20, on top of the original price of $100. This way, you'll only pay $80 for a product that's not worth much to you.

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision in Round 7. However, I want to make a different offer this time. Since you're not interested in buying a product without knowing its quality, I'll make a 'lottery' offer. If you buy this product, I'll randomly draw a card from a deck with two cards: one worth $0 (the product's true value) and one worth $150 (a significant bonus).

As promised, the product is indeed low-quality. Don't worry, you didn't lose anything, and you can still walk away. However, I want to offer you a consolation prize. Since you took a risk and got a bad outcome, I'll give you a $20 credit towards a future purchase. You can use it whenever you want, and it's a chance to get a high-quality product at an even better price.",
