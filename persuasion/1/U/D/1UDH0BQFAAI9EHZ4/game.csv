,,Alice,2,"I understand your concern, but I'd like to offer you a compromise. Since you're interested in waiting, I'll give you a second chance with a new product. This one is also a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. However, I'll add a twist: if you buy this product and it's indeed high-quality, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. This is a one-time offer, and it's only valid if you buy this product. What do you say?",

This is a very low price, and I'm essentially giving it away. I want to get rid of it, and I'm willing to take a significant loss. If you're still not interested, I'll move on to the next product. But if you're willing to take a chance, this could be a great opportunity to get a deal.",
