,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it, so I'm expecting it to be low quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the statistics. Since no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is still high. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality, so I'll pass."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not going to take the risk. I don't want to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the low success rate so far."

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given the previous 4 buyers have also bought the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more high-quality products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products were low quality, which is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is low. I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and will pass on the product."
