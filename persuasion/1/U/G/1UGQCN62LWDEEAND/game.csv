low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, I'd expect a higher proportion of high-quality products to be sold, but only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality. Can you explain why you think this product is not worth buying?"
