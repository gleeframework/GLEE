,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the prior probability and the recommendation from Alice. If the prior probability is 80% and the recommendation is neutral, I'd expect the probability to be around 80%. However, since Alice recommends buying, it suggests that the product is more likely to be high quality. I'd like to know the updated probability."
