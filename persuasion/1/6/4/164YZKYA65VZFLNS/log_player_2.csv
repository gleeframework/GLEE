"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to get a unique product at a steal! I'm offering it to you for $10000, which is a fraction of its actual value. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time exception to the usual price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
