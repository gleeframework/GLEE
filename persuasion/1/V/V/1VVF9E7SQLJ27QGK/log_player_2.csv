Alice's message: Congratulations on your purchase! I'm glad you took the chance. Unfortunately, this product is also low-quality. I've sold 0 high-quality products and 3 low-quality products now. I'd like to offer you a new perspective: since you've seen two low-quality products in a row, you might think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%.

But I'll make it more interesting: if you decline, I'll give you a refund of $1000, just for considering the purchase. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Although I appreciate the offer and the potential refund of $1000, I've decided to decline.

Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer who's done your math! I appreciate your skepticism. I'd like to acknowledge that the past sales record does suggest a lower proportion of high-quality products.

Alice's message: I apologize for the confusion in the previous sales record.
