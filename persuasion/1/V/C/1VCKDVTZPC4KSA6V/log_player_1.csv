  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're curious! This product is actually a special case. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to warn you that it's not as good as the one you just bought. It's a bit... rough around the edges. But hey, it's still a product, and it's only $100. You might be able to find a use for it somewhere down the line.""

But, I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm starting to run low on high-quality products, and I really need to get rid of some of these... 'character-building' items. So, I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $80, and I'll even throw in a 10% discount on the next one if you buy it.""

But, I have to be honest with you, I really need to move this inventory. I'm willing to make a one-time exception and sell this product to you for $50.
