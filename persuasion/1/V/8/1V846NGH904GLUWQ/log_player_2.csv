Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 6 total products so far, but the last three products were low-quality. To calculate the probability of the next product being high-quality, let's consider that I've sold 3 high-quality products in the first 5 sales, which is 3/5 = 60%. However, since the last 3 sales were low-quality, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product has decreased. Assuming a uniform distribution, I would estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality to be around 25%. Would you like to buy this one for $100?

Given the buyer's correct assessment that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, I'll be transparent and provide more information.
