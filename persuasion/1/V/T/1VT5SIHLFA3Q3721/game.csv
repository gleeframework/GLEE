,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no prior information to make an informed decision. I'll take the risk and see what happens."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product. Was it high or low quality?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not convinced that the product is high quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and how many total products were offered before my turn. I'd also like to know the probability that the product I will be offered will be high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know you have a recommendation, but I'd like to think about the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%. This seems suspiciously high. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 sold so far, which suggests a low proportion of high-quality products. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to wait for more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 80.00%. However, since Alice recommended it, it's likely that she knows it's low-quality. I'd rather wait for another product to be offered."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, and also the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that you want to sell it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2. However, given the low number of sales, I'm concerned that this might not be representative of the overall product quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
