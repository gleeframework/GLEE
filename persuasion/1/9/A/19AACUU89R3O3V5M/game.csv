,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the quality of the product, but based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it and there are no high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about its quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so only because I don't have any information about the product's quality. I'm essentially taking a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendations from previous buyers might indicate a higher likelihood of the product being low quality, but I'm not confident in this reasoning."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems like the products offered so far have been low-quality, and I'm skeptical about this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I suspect that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be higher than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products were sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely to be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
