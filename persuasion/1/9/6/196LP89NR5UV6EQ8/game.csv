,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I'm the first buyer, I want to set the precedent and see if the product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I understand that your recommendation is based on the previous sales record, but I'd like to take a chance and buy it myself."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low success rate so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than I'd like. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low quality, especially since I have access to the previous sales record and the odds of a high-quality product are 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there any specific information that led you to suggest I shouldn't buy the product?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because of the low overall proportion of high-quality products sold, or is there another reason?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I would like to pass on the product and see if you would recommend it to the next buyer. I want to observe more data before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that Alice recommends it might be a red flag, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). This suggests that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which is a relatively low proportion of high-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'll take the product based on your recommendation, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea since I don't know the actual quality of the product. Can you tell me more about the product and the probability of it being high-quality?"
