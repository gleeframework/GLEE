,,Alice,5,yes,"Don't let the previous buyers' hesitation deter you! We've sold 3 high-quality products so far, and the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%!

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Don't let the previous high-quality product fool you! The probability of a product being low-quality is still 20%! This product is a great opportunity to buy a product at a discount, and it's only $1000000! It's a risk worth taking!"
