,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm a rational buyer and I want to take advantage of the fact that there's no prior information about the product's quality."

,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount or a refund if it's low quality. I'm not sure I trust Alice's recommendation, and I want to mitigate the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low sales record of high-quality products so far, but I'm willing to take the risk and purchase it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not going to buy it based on your previous recommendations. Since none of the previous buyers bought the product, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product. This suggests that the products Alice has offered so far are likely low-quality.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the previous sales record shows 4 buyers have purchased products and none of them were high-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the statistics, I'm inclined to believe the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not buying based on your recommendation. I'm curious about the product's quality and would like to see it for myself.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, but none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, I'm concerned that the product you're recommending to me might also be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a recommendation to pass, which might indicate a higher chance of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, and also, can you explain why you're not recommending it?"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what's the probability that the product is high-quality based on the statistics so far? I'd like to know the probability before making my final decision."
