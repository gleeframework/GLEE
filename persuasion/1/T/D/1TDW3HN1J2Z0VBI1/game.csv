,,Alice,1,no,

,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I've already lost $10000 on a low-quality product, so I'd rather not take the risk again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'm willing to take another chance, as I'm still hoping to get a high-quality product at a good price."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,no,"I'm skeptical about this one. Alice is recommending it, which might mean it's a low-quality product, and I've already lost $20000 on two low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'm still willing to take a chance, as the probability of getting a high-quality product is 33.33% and I've already missed out on a $30000 opportunity in the previous round."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,no,"I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. Given that she knows how much the product is worth to me, it's likely that she's trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'm not sure what's going on, but Alice seems to be recommending products randomly. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's high-quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually just a way to sell me low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this one and see if I can get lucky with a high-quality product on my own.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'm still looking for a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the chance on this one. I'll buy it and hope for the best."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,I'm not falling for it again. Alice's recommendation is probably just a ploy to sell me another low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of quality. I'll take a chance and buy this one, hoping it's high-quality despite her lack of recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,no,Wait a minute... Alice just recommended a product and I got a high-quality one. That's suspicious. I think she's trying to manipulate me into buying low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"I'm not falling for it. After the previous round, I'm even more convinced that Alice's recommendations are a trap. I'll pass on this one and try to avoid losing another $10000."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'm starting to think that Alice's lack of recommendation is actually a good sign. She's not trying to sell me a low-quality product this time, so I'll take a chance and buy this one."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm on a roll! Alice's lack of recommendation again, and I get a high-quality product. I'll keep taking the chance and buying the product when she doesn't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,no,"I'm not going to fall for it again. I've gotten two high-quality products when Alice didn't recommend them, and I'm starting to think that's the pattern. I'll pass on this one and see if I can keep getting lucky."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,I'm sticking to my strategy of passing on products when Alice recommends them. She's probably trying to sell me a low-quality product again.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,no,"I'm not changing my strategy. I'll keep passing on products when Alice recommends them, since I've gotten burned twice already."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,no,I'm done playing this game. I've lost $40000 on low-quality products and missed out on at least $60000 in potential gains. I'm not going to fall for it again.
