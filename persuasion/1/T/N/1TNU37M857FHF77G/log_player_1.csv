```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, it's in his best interest to buy. He has a chance of getting a product worth more than the $1,000,000 price, even if he doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product."

**Explanation:**

Since the product is low-quality, it's not a good idea to recommend Bob buy it. While he might get lucky and find a high-quality product in future rounds, there's no guarantee of that. We know this product is low-quality and therefore likely worth less than $1,000,000 to Bob.  It's better to avoid this purchase and wait for a potential high-quality product in a later round."

It's best to continue to decline purchases until we have reason to believe the product is worth the price.  Bob has already seen a low-quality product, so recommending another low-quality purchase would likely further damage trust."

It's a good time to recommend another purchase, especially since we know this product is high-quality."
