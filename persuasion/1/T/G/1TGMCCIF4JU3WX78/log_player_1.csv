"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%.  Since a high-quality product is worth $12,500 to Bob and the price is only $10,000, it's a good deal for him.  Even though there's a risk of a low-quality product in future rounds, in this specific round, the information available strongly suggests purchasing."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round, the product is low-quality.  Bob knows that there's a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality. Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to Bob, there's no benefit in buying it, even though the price is fixed. The risk outweighs the potential reward in this round."
"Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, it's still a gamble.  He has just experienced a low-quality product in the previous round, which further reinforces the risk.  With the potential for a low-quality product worth $0, and a fixed price of $10,000, it's not a wise decision for Bob to buy in this round."
"Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant after last round. I'll pass again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is consistently passing on the product. This is a good indication that he is starting to understand the risk-reward ratio.  Three consecutive rounds of low-quality products have reinforced his belief that the chances of getting a high-quality product are low.  Recommending the purchase would be irresponsible in this round."
"Bob's message: I'm starting to notice a pattern here. I'll pass again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now experienced four rounds with low-quality products. This further solidifies his understanding of the risk associated with purchasing. Even though there's a chance of a high-quality product in future rounds, the current information suggests that the probability is low. Therefore, recommending a purchase would be unreasonable in this round."
"Bob's message: Based on the previous rounds, I'm confident Alice is being truthful about the product's quality. I'll pass again.
Bob didn't bought the product.

```

**Explanation:**

```

**Explanation:**

He has clearly established his preference for avoiding the risk and has demonstrated his ability to make informed decisions.
