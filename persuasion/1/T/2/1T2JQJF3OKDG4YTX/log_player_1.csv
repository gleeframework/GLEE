Among those 3 buyers, 2 were experienced buyers who had purchased products from me before, while the third was a first-time buyer.

"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance, but I'm only willing to pay $900000 for the product. I'm basing my decision on the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products before me, and none of them were high-quality.
