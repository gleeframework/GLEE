,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation, Bob. But let me ask you, what's the value of having a product that could potentially increase your productivity by 20%? What's the value of having a product that could give you a competitive edge in the market? I'm not just selling you a product, I'm offering you a solution to your problems.
