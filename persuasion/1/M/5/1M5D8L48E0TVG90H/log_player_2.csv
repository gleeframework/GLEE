"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the true value of the product, and she recommends buying it, it's highly likely that the product is high-quality. It's a 50/50 chance, but given the potential payoff of $20,000 (value to you minus price), the risk is worth taking."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now against buying the product. Given her knowledge of the product's quality, it's highly likely this is a low-quality product. Since it's worth $0 to me, there's no chance of profit, and therefore no reason to take the risk."

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has recommended against buying the product in both Round 2 and Round 3. This suggests a pattern where her recommendations are reliable.  Since there's a strong possibility the product is low quality and worthless, it's best to pass on this one."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now aligned with the outcome of the previous two rounds. She recommended against buying the product in Rounds 2 and 3, and both were low-quality.  Now she recommends buying the product, so it's likely to be high-quality.  Given the potential profit of $20,000, it's worth taking the risk."
