"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) outweighs the risk of a low-quality product ($0).  Since Alice knows the true quality, her recommendation carries weight. It's statistically advantageous to buy, hoping for a high-quality product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $100!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $300 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now the opposite of her previous one. Given that she knows the product's quality, her lack of recommendation implies a high likelihood of a low-quality product. This makes the risk of buying too high, so it's best to pass."

```

**Explanation:**

Despite the previous round's outcome, Alice's recommendation is valuable. Even though we now know there's a chance of a low-quality product, her recommendation carries weight.  We're still statistically better off buying and hoping for the high-quality product. It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
