,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but I'd rather wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, since the previous buyer didn't buy it after Alice's recommendation. This might indicate that the product is more likely to be low quality, and I can still get a good deal if it's high quality."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure what to make of your recommendation, and I'm hoping the product is high-quality just because of the low sales record so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous buyers, which makes me suspect that the product might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality, given the statistics so far."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."

,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to get some data to make a more informed decision for the next buyer."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that 5 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than the overall 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far also suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is relatively low. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, given that none of the previous 6 buyers have received a high-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not buying. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which might lead her to recommend low-quality products more often."
