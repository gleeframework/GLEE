low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that you recommended me not to buy, I'm going to assume the product is low-quality. Since 2 out of 5 products sold were high-quality, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 2/5 = 0.4. This is less than the true proportion of high-quality products, 0.3333. Therefore, I'm going to pass on the product."
