* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product and losing $1,000,000, the potential gain of $200,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is on a winning streak and believes Alice might have inside information, the expected value calculation for this round is unchanged:

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000. 

However, the *actual* value of this product is $0 because it's low-quality.  This means that if Bob buys it, he will lose $1,000,000. While the expected value suggests a possible profit,  the **risk** of losing $1,000,000 on a single product is too high to recommend buying it."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now aware that the product is not always high-quality, even though Alice's track record has been perfect so far. While the expected value is still positive, the risk of losing $1,000,000 on a low-quality product is high. Bob's skepticism is justified. 

* **Expected Value:** (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000
* **Actual Value:**  $0 (since this product is low-quality)

Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product."

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now questioning Alice's judgment, but the fundamental factors haven't changed:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains (0.8 * $1,200,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $960,000, which is greater than the price.
* **Bob's Skepticism:** While Bob might be hesitant, the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. It's important to remember that Alice doesn't know the quality in advance, and even a perfect track record doesn't guarantee future success.

Therefore, it's still recommended to buy the product, as the expected value outweighs the risk, even considering Bob's doubts."
