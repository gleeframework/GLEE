,,Alice,14,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous three buyers purchased the product, and the fact that all of them received a recommendation to buy from you, it seems that the products they received were likely low-quality. If the product I'm being offered is high-quality, I'd expect at least one of the previous buyers to have purchased it. Since that didn't happen, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better product."
