high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products have been sold suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a new product.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%.
