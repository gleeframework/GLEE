low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I appreciate your caution in the previous round. I'd like to provide some additional context: the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%. Since the first product sold was low-quality, the probability of the next one being high-quality hasn't changed.

,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns about the product's features and quality. I'd like to assure you that I'm transparent about the product's quality. As you know, the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%. The fact that the previous high-quality product was sold doesn't change the underlying probability.
