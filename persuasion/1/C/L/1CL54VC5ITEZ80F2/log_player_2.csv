"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the value of the product to you, her recommendation carries significant weight.  It's highly likely that the product is of high quality, given her incentive to sell you something valuable.  Even though there's a 20% chance of it being low quality, the potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the risk in this first round."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the information. I'll pass on this one.  Given your recommendation, I'm assuming it's likely low quality.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is now reversed. Since she knows the value of the product, her lack of recommendation strongly suggests it's likely low quality. In this case, the risk of losing $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $40,000 from a high-quality product."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation carries a lot of weight. Even though we now know there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, Alice's knowledge of the product's value makes her recommendation valuable. The potential reward of $40,000 still outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.  We're essentially betting on Alice's information and expertise."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is consistently valuable.  Even though we've seen a mix of high and low-quality products, her pattern of recommending only high-quality products so far makes her lack of recommendation a strong indicator that the current product is likely low quality.  The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain of $40,000 in this case."
