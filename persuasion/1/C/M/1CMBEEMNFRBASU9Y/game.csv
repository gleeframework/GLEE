,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. Since no products have been sold yet, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not influenced by your recommendation. I'm doing this for the sake of the game."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have already passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products have been high quality. I think this is a biased recommendation, and I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics. With 3 buyers having already purchased and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the previous 3 buyers, and the probability of a low-quality product being sold to the previous 3 buyers, based on the current statistics."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that Alice's recommendation may not be based on any information about my valuation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the previous 5 buyers were likely presented with low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 5, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see a higher proportion of high-quality products sold before I consider buying."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 5 buyers having passed on the products before me and none of them being high-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 buyers have passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is relatively low, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
