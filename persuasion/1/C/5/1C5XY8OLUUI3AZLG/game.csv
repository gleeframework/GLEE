That means the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'd like to remind you that our overall success rate is actually higher than that. We've had 4 rounds, and 2 out of 2 high-quality products have been sold. That's a 100% success rate for high-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach. However, I'd like to take a different approach this time.

As for the low-quality product, it was a mass-produced item that didn't quite meet our usual standards.
