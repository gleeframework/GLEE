,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. It's a great deal, and I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. This is a one-time offer, and it's a steal!",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk since it's the first product and I don't have any prior information to go by.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 total products so far. Given the quality of the previous product, it's likely that I'm trying to get rid of the low-quality ones first. This one might be a high-quality gem. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product. I understand that the probability of it being high-quality is 80%, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're looking for a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price? I've got just the thing for you. I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 total products so far, which means I'm 100% of the way to my goal of selling 20 high-quality products. It's likely that the next product I offer will also be high-quality. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about the next one. Take a chance and buy this one for a potentially great deal!",
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take the chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality and a great deal!",yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're looking for a high-quality product, and I've got another one for you. I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 total products so far, and I'm on a roll. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm offering you a chance to take advantage of my streak. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about the next one. Consider this a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price.",
,,the buyer,4,I'm willing to take the chance and buy the product. I believe in your streak and think it's a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.,yes
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're seeing a pattern here, aren't you? I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row, and the probability of the next one being high-quality is still 80%. But let's be real, the law of averages is on my side, and it's likely that the next product will be high-quality as well. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about the next one. Take a chance and buy this one, and you might just be getting another great deal!",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced by your argument. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Don't be fooled by my previous streak! Just because I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row doesn't mean I'm guaranteed to sell the next one. In fact, I've now sold 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which means the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually higher than you might think. This one might be a great opportunity to get a low-quality product at the same price as the high-quality ones. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not expecting a high-quality one this time around. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a good price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're a savvy buyer, I like that. You're aware that the probability of the next product being low-quality is higher than high-quality. Well, I've got some bad news for you: I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row now. That's 5 out of 6 total products, which means the probability of the next product being low-quality is actually 83.3%. I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. You're basically guaranteed to get a low-quality product at this point.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your statistics, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.",no
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. But let's be real, I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row, which means I'm due for a high-quality one. In fact, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 90%! I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000, and I'm confident that you'll be getting a high-quality product. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get a great deal on a high-quality product.",

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a skeptical buyer, and I respect that. But let's look at the facts: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which means I'm 75% of the way to my goal of selling 20 high-quality products. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, and I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000. I'm not trying to manipulate you, I'm just trying to make a sale. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this is a great opportunity to get one at a great price.",

With 8 high-quality products sold out of 11 total products, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually 86.7%! But let's not get ahead of ourselves, I've still got 8 low-quality products to get rid of.

,,Alice,13,"You're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. But let's look at the numbers: I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 12 total products, which means I'm 90% of the way to my goal of selling 20 high-quality products. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm willing to let this one go for $1000000. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to make a sale.
