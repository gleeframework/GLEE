**Reasoning:**

While the odds are still against us (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), there's a crucial piece of information: **Alice has a vested interest in selling high-quality products**.  She knows the true value of each product, and therefore, recommending a purchase implies a higher likelihood of it being high quality.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's Reputation:**  Alice benefits from building a good reputation.  Recommending low-quality products consistently would damage that.
* **Future Sales:**  By selling high-quality products, Alice increases the chance of future sales, as buyers will be more likely to trust her recommendations.

Therefore, while the odds are still stacked against us, the recommendation from Alice adds a significant element of confidence."
