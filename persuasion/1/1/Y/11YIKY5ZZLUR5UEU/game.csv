high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see the statistics after this product is revealed, and then I'll make my decision on the next one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'd like to see the statistics after you sell it to the next buyer and get their response. I want to get a better idea of the quality distribution before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see some data on the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality yet."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the prior probability of 80% and the fact that no products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to take advantage of the low price and get a high-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I've seen that 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product, and I think the probability of it being high quality is still relatively high."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record, which shows only 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold. This means that the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3, which is lower than the 80% probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the sample size is still small and only one high-quality product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold before I make a decision, and I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping it's low quality so I don't lose money."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 5, it seems like the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 80%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the low sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, so I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 out of 5 buyers purchased the product and only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
