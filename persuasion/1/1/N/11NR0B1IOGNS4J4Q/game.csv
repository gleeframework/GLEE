low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I'm the second buyer and there haven't been any sales yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and get a good deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm hesitant to buy a product that you don't recommend, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'd like to buy the product"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the low success rate of high-quality products in the previous sales, and Alice's recommendation doesn't change my uncertainty about the product's quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her not knowing the quality of the product, and since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that this product is also low-quality. I'd rather wait and see what happens with the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm hoping to be the one to get the good one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and your lack of recommendation suggests it might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the fact that 6 buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product suggests that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk. Since the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/6, I'm assuming the product is more likely to be low-quality. However, I'm also considering the fact that you're not recommending it, which might suggest that you have some information that I don't. I'm taking a chance and buying the product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know why you recommended it, but based on the statistics, it seems like all the previous products were low-quality, so I'm not confident in this recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%, but the fact that you don't recommend it makes me skeptical. I'd rather wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendations have been 0 for 7. I'm not confident in the quality of the product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the products sold so far might be low-quality, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. With 7 buyers having bought and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 7 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $100 and there's no guarantee of getting a high-quality product in the next round."
