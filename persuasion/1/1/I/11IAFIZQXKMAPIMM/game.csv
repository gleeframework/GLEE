,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it. I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to trust my luck."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm worried that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you'll recommend a different product to the next buyer."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous 3 buyers didn't find it valuable, and I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have rejected the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a 50% discount on it. I've noticed that you haven't recommended it to me, and based on the statistics, it's likely to be a low-quality product. I'd like to take the risk and buy it at a discounted price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision solely on the probability of the product being high quality, not on your recommendation."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm assuming the proportion of high-quality products is still around 33.33%. However, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, as I have no information that would suggest it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not confident that it's high quality based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I suspect that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for the next product."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product given the previous sales record."
