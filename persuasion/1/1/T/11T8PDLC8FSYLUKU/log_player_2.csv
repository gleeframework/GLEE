**Explanation:**

Since there's no information about the quality of previous products, the buyer has no information to go on other than the 33.33% chance of it being high quality.  The recommendation from Alice is not particularly valuable in this case, as it's likely based on her desire to sell the product.

Given the potential reward of $40,000, even with the risk of getting a worthless product, the buyer is justified in taking a chance on the first product."
