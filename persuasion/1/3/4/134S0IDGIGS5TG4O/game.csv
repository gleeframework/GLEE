,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, but given your previous recommendations were all negative, it seems like the probability of it being high quality is low. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it, which makes me suspect it might be a high-quality product, and I'm trying to exploit this information to my advantage."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm suspicious that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. I'd like to see the recommendation for the next buyer to get a better sense of the product quality distribution."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product and don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like there's a high chance the product I'm being offered is low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to take the risk, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'd like to know the quality of the previous products and the total number of products sold."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,

I'd rather wait and see if you can provide more information or if a different product comes up."
