**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommending you buy the product is a strong signal. Even though the product has a higher chance of being low quality, Alice knows the value of each product.  
* **Past Sales:**  The fact that 4 high-quality products were sold out of 4 buyers is a very strong indicator that Alice is only recommending high-quality products. 

While there's still a risk, the information available suggests a high likelihood of a high-quality product. It's worth taking the risk given the potential reward."
