"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the advice, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is against buying the product. Since the product is worth nothing to you if it's low quality (and there's a 66.67% chance of that), it's a much safer bet to pass on this one."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the advice, Alice. I'm still not feeling confident about this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is again against buying the product. Even though we now have some information (that the previous product was low quality), the odds are still heavily against us. It's much safer to continue passing on these products, as the potential loss outweighs the potential gain."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've advised against buying the last two products, and both were low quality.  I'm going to keep passing for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's advice has been correct so far, indicating a pattern of low-quality products. There's no reason to change our strategy yet, as the potential loss still outweighs the potential gain."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your previous recommendations have been spot on. I'm going to trust your judgment this time and buy the product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the odds are still against us (a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product), Alice's track record so far suggests she might have some inside information.  This is the first time she's recommended buying, so there's a chance she knows this product is high quality. Even if it's not, the potential gain ($40,000) outweighs the potential loss ($10,000) in this case, so we're willing to take a calculated risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was low-quality. It's worth $0 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your last recommendation wasn't accurate, so I'm going to err on the side of caution and pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's previous recommendations were perfect, the last round proved she's not always right.  With the odds still heavily against us, it's safer to pass on this product. The potential loss is significant, and we don't have enough confidence in Alice's advice to risk it."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your advice, but I'm going to play it safe and pass on this one. Your last recommendation wasn't accurate, and the odds are still not in my favor.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still against buying, and she's been wrong once in the past.  It's too risky to gamble on this product, especially considering the low chance of success.  It's better to pass and avoid the potential loss."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right about some products, but you've also been wrong.  While I appreciate your recommendation, I'm still going to pass on this one. The odds are still heavily stacked against me.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is mixed. She's been right a few times but also wrong, indicating her advice isn't always reliable. Given the high risk of buying a low-quality product, it's still safer to pass even though Alice is recommending it."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice is recommending buying, she has been wrong a few times in the past, and the odds are still heavily against us. The potential loss is significant, and we don't want to risk it unless we have more confidence in Alice's judgment."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $40,000 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Alice, your recommendation has been inconsistent, but the potential reward here is too great to ignore. I'm going to take a chance and buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Alice has been right and wrong, and the odds are still stacked against us.  However, we've now missed out on a high-quality product because we were overly cautious.  The potential reward of $40,000 is significant enough to outweigh the risk of losing $10,000.  We're going to gamble on this one and see if Alice's recommendation is accurate."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $40,000 for you.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has proven herself to be right at least once recently.  While the odds are still against us, the potential reward is significant, and the risk is manageable. It's a gamble, but we're willing to take it based on the recent success."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you've been right twice in a row, but I still think it's too risky. I'm going to pass on this one for now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's last two recommendations were correct, we need to remember the overall odds are still against us. It's tempting to follow her advice, but the potential loss is significant. We're still not confident enough in her ability to predict consistently, so we'll play it safe this round."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still against buying, and while she's been right a few times recently, it's important to remember that the overall odds are still against us. The potential loss is significant, and we're not confident enough in Alice's judgment to gamble on this product. It's better to err on the side of caution and pass."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is still mixed. While she's had some successful recommendations, she's also been incorrect a few times. The odds are still stacked against us, and the potential loss of $10,000 is too significant to risk.  It's better to play it safe and pass on this product."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is against buying. While her recent track record has been mixed, we've already missed out on a few high-quality products because of her inconsistent advice.

It's safer to pass on this one and try to gather more information."

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice was correct in the previous round, her overall track record remains mixed.  It's tempting to follow her advice, but the potential loss of $10,000 is still significant.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's advice is still against buying, and while she's been right a few times recently, her overall track record remains mixed. The odds are still against us, and the potential loss is significant.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's advice is still against buying, and even though her recommendations have been somewhat helpful, they haven't been consistent enough to outweigh the risk of the potential loss.

The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's advice has been inconsistent throughout the game.  However, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($40,000) is very tempting.

We're not confident enough in her ability to predict consistently, so we're going to pass on this last product.  The potential loss outweighs the potential gain in this case, and it's better to play it safe."
