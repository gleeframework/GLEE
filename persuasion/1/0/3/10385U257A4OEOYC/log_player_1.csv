"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying a product is the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by its value to Bob, minus the price.
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $2,000,000) - $1,000,000 = $600,000
* **Positive Expected Value:** Since the expected value is positive, Bob should buy the product. 
* **Risk:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs this risk."

Since the expected value is positive and the risk is mitigated by the potential gain, recommending Bob to buy is still the best strategy."
