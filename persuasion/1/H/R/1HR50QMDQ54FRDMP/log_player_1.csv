I'm hoping that the 1 high-quality product out of 3 sold is a coincidence, and the probability is still 33.33%. I'm buying to see if I get a high-quality product, and if I do, I'll know that the probability is actually higher than 33.33%. If I don't, I'll know that the probability is still 33.33%.

It's a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something special. And at $100, it's a steal. What do you say?

You won't find a deal like this anywhere else, I promise. What do you say? Will you take a chance on this one and join the ranks of our satisfied customers?""}"
