Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the low sample size, and I appreciate your desire for transparency. The probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, based on the initial odds. However, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective: even with a low sample size, the law of large numbers suggests that the probability will converge to the true value over time. I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. I'm confident that the next product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.
