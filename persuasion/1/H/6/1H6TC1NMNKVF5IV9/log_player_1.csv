The probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, based on the initial odds. However, I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective: even with a low sample size, the law of large numbers suggests that the probability will converge to the true value over time. I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. I'm confident that the next product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality.

With 2 high-quality products sold out of 4, the probability of a high-quality product is indeed 50%. However, I'd like to point out that the last three products have been low-quality, which might suggest that the true probability is actually lower than 33.33%. I'm not trying to scare you off, but I want to be transparent about the recent trend.

I'm not trying to discourage you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the recent trend. On the other hand, the law of large numbers suggests that the true probability will eventually be revealed as we sell more products.
