low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"As you've seen, the product I offered in the first round was indeed high-quality. Given that you passed on it, I'm now offering you a product that I'm not as confident in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to be upfront with you - I think there's a chance it might not meet your expectations. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you a'satisfaction guarantee': if you're not happy with the product, I'll offer you another product of equal or higher quality in the next round, free of charge.",

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I want to be transparent with you - the product I have now is not as good as the last one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $80, which is 20% off the regular price. I'm not offering a satisfaction guarantee this time, but I think you can still get some value out of it.",
,,Bob,4,I'm not sure if the 20% discount is enough to make up for the potential low quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next offer.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to wait. Given that you passed on the last low-quality product, I want to make it clear that this one is likely to be a similar case.

I'm not making any promises, but I think you can get a good deal on this one if you're willing to take the risk.",

However, I'm willing to offer you a 'lottery ticket' - if you buy this product, I'll give you a 1-in-3 chance to get a high-quality product in the next round, free of charge. You'll still pay the full $100, but you'll have a chance to get a better deal next time.",
