,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making the final decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, as I believe the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the cost of a low-quality one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold before making a decision.

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see if you can provide more information about the product's quality before I make a decision.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable given the small sample size of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see the statistics on the 3 previous buyers who purchased the products, including how many high-quality products were recommended to them and how many they purchased."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the current product. Based on the previous sales record, 2 high-quality products were sold out of 3 purchases, which is a 66.67% success rate. However, the true probability of a product being high-quality is 80.00%. I would like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record, specifically the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record. Given that 2 out of 3 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm assuming that Alice's recommendations are reliable. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the recommendation is based on Alice's previous sales record, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more data or a more reliable recommendation."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards high-quality products. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $1000000 price tag, and I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice to see if it's a low-quality product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 4 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 = 0.75, which is higher than the expected value of 0.8. This suggests that the current product might be more likely to be low-quality, and I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). However, I'm concerned that the observed proportion might be due to chance. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the previous sales record. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4, which is 0.75. Given the 80% chance of a high-quality product, I'd expect to see more than 3 high-quality products sold if the true proportion is 80%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 products sold were high quality, which is a higher proportion than the 80% chance of a product being high quality. I'm skeptical and will pass on the product."
