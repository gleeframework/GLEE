The probability of the product being high-quality is now 92.31% (12/13).

However, the buyer's assumption that my recommendations are reliable is not necessarily correct. In fact, the buyer's decision to buy the product was likely due to their own risk assessment and not necessarily because of my recommendation.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendation. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards high-quality products. I'm not convinced that the product is worth the $1000000 price tag, and I'd rather wait for a product that has not been recommended by Alice to see if it's a low-quality product.

However, I'll also take note of the buyer's comment about the price tag, and consider that the buyer might be more interested in a low-quality product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the 4 previous sales, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4 = 0.75, which is higher than the expected value of 0.8. This suggests that the current product might be more likely to be low-quality, and I'd like to wait for the next product.

Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4, which is higher than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%).

I'll provide the requested information to the current buyer, and also acknowledge the buyer's concerns about the observed proportion of high-quality products.

Since the buyer has shown a pattern of skepticism, I'll also try to reassure them that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation based on the previous sales record. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 3/4, which is 0.75.
