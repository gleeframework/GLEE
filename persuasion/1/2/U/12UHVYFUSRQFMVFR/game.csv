,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision to wait. Let me ask you a question: would you be willing to buy this product if you knew it was worth $0 to you? I'm not asking you to take on any risk, and you'd essentially be getting the product for free. If you're not willing to do that, then it's likely that you're waiting for a high-quality product, and I'll make sure to save that for the next round. Would you like to take the product at $10000, or would you like to wait?",
,,Bob,4,"That's a clever question, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I'm not willing to buy a product worth $0 to me, even if it's essentially free. I'm waiting for a high-quality product.",no
