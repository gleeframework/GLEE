"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and a 50% chance of being low quality, and a high-quality product is worth $120 to you, it's a worthwhile gamble. Even if it turns out to be low quality, you only lose $100, but if it's high quality, you make a $20 profit."

The product was high-quality. It's worth $120 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I'll trust your judgment again!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The outcome of the previous round doesn't change the odds for this round.  Each product has a 50/50 chance of being high or low quality, independent of the previous round. So the same logic applies - a potential $20 profit is worth the risk of a $100 loss."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendations have been accurate so far.  Since she's not recommending this product, it's likely a low-quality product.  The potential loss of $100 outweighs the potential profit of $20 in this case."
