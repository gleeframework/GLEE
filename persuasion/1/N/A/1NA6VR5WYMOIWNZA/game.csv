low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And what is the probability of a product being high-quality based on the previous sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product!"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't want to be the first to buy a product, and I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a bias towards low-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk since I'm the fourth buyer and there have been no high-quality products sold yet. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, but the probability of a product being low-quality is now 100% given that all previous products were low-quality. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered, or for more information to be available before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 5 buyers have passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have passed on the products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is likely lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a bias in the selection process or that the products are mostly low-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have passed on the product and none have been high quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass. The probability of a high-quality product remaining is likely higher than the average, and I don't want to be the one to pay $10000 for a low-quality product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it. I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended not to buy, but I'm also considering the low probability of a high-quality product being sold so far."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of the product's quality."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the current statistics, 7 out of 8 products have been low quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely to be low quality. I would like to pass on this product to avoid wasting $10000 on a potentially worthless item."
