**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that 1 high-quality product has been sold, but we don't know how many low-quality products have been sold. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who knows the product's true quality, recommends buying. This is significant information, as she has a strong incentive to sell high-quality products to maintain her reputation and future sales.
* **Potential Upside:**  Even though the odds are against us (66.67% chance of low quality), the potential payoff of $40,000 if it's high quality outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. 

It's a gamble, but with Alice's recommendation and the potential for a large profit, it's worth taking the risk."
