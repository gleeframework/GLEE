A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You know the product is low-quality. Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, they will likely assume this is a low-quality product. There's no reason to recommend a low-quality product at $10,000."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, you have a high-quality product. Even though the buyer didn't purchase the first product, you should still recommend this one. Here's why:

* **Probability:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This is a strong incentive for them to consider a purchase.
* **No information about the previous product:** The buyer doesn't know the first product was low-quality. They are simply observing your selling history, which is currently empty. 
* **High-quality product:** This is your chance to make a sale and start building trust. 

While it's possible the buyer might still pass, it's worth recommending the product given the circumstances."

This data is still limited, but it is likely to be enough to increase the buyer's trust.
