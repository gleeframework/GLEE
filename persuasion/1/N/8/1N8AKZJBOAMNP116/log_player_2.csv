**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point - one previous buyer bought a high-quality product. This is not enough information to make a statistically sound decision.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is the key piece of information. As a rational seller, Alice likely wouldn't recommend a low-quality product, as she would lose the potential buyer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a 50% chance of the product being low-quality, the potential gain of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy relies on the assumption that Alice is acting rationally and in her best interest. If Alice is not a reliable source of information, then the decision would be much more complex."
