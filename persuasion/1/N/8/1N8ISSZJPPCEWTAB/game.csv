,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer also received a recommendation to buy and chose to buy, but no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the first buyer may have bought a low-quality product. If that's the case, it would be more likely that the second product is also low-quality, given the 2/3 chance. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
