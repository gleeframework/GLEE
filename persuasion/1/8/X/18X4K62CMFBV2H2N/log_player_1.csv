"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Value:** The product is high-quality and worth $2,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price vs. Value:**  The buyer is getting a product worth $2,000,000 for only $1,000,000. This is a significant profit for the buyer.
* **Lack of Information:** The buyer has no information about the product's quality other than the seller's general track record (which they don't have yet). The odds of getting a high-quality product are 80%, which is significantly in the buyer's favor.

**It's a no-brainer to recommend buying in this scenario.**"
