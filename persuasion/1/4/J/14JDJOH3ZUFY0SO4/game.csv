low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer and set a precedent for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the information that you passed on the previous product, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a product that has a 50% chance of being low quality without any information about its quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as you don't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending the product to me?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, all previous products were low-quality since none were sold. I'm not sure if this one is high-quality, but I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when I know it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know the value I place on it, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I believe the probability of a high-quality product is still high."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the proportion of high-quality products is likely higher than 50% based on your previous recommendations, and I'm trying to take advantage of this opportunity."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product and I can get it for $10000, which is a good deal compared to its actual value of $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't trust your recommendations. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have passed on the products with 0 high-quality products sold, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate that the products are mostly low-quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 8, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, which might make her think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than it actually is. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product to test the hypothesis that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the first 9 purchases, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
