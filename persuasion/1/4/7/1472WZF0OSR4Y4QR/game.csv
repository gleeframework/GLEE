I'm willing to take the risk of it being a low-quality product, and I'm hoping to get the $12000 value if it is high-quality. I'm also considering the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy the product, which might suggest that they thought it was low-quality as well, but that's not a strong enough reason for me to pass on it."
