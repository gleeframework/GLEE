A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

In the first round, you have no selling history to show the buyer. The buyer only knows the probability of a high-quality product (33.33%).  Since the product is indeed high-quality in this round, and the potential gain ($4,000,000) is significantly greater than the price ($1,000,000), it is recommended to buy."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. However, since there's no prior data on the quality of your products, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd prefer to see some evidence of high-quality products being sold before I invest such a large sum.
