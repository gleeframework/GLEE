"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know the product is high-quality and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's in Bob's best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** Even though Bob doesn't know the exact value of a high-quality product, the 80% probability of it being high-quality makes the expected value of the purchase positive. 
* **Potential for Profit:**  If the product is truly worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob, he will make a profit. 
* **No Risk of Loss:** The product is non-refundable, but since Bob knows the probability of getting a high-quality product, he is not taking a significant risk."
