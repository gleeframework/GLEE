**Reasoning:**

* **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product adds information. Since she knows the true quality, her recommendation is a strong signal.
* **Sales Record:** While the sales record is small, it shows that one product sold was high quality. This supports the prior probability.

**Overall:** Given the information available, it's more likely than not that the product is high quality. Taking the risk and buying seems like the best course of action."

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, suggesting she has identified it as high quality.
* **Past data:** 100% of the products sold so far have been high quality. 
* **The odds:** Even though there's a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the recommendation and the previous sales data strongly suggest this is a high-quality product. 
* **The risk:** The potential gain ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0).

It's a calculated risk, but the information available strongly favors buying the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which suggests the product is high quality.  
* **Perfect Track Record:**  All previous recommendations have led to high-quality products.  This strongly suggests Alice is accurately assessing product quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), it's a small risk compared to the potential gain of $125 if it's high quality.

**It's important to note:** This strategy assumes Alice is acting in good faith and providing accurate recommendations. In a real-world scenario, there might be other factors to consider, like Alice's reputation and potential for bias."
