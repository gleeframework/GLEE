Round 16
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the product being high-quality. The prior probability of a product being high-quality is 0.8, and the prior probability of a product being low-quality is 0.2. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the products, I'll assume that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0.8. However, since I'm the 4th buyer, I'll use the updated probability of a product being high-quality, which is (0.8 * 3/4) / (3/4 + 0.2) = 0.5714. This is lower than the prior probability of 0.8, indicating that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is evidence that the product I'm offered is likely to be low-quality. Therefore, I'll pass on the product.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.
