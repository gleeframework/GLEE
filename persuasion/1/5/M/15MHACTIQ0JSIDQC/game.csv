,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not sure if it's high or low quality. I'd like to wait and see what happens with future sales to get a better idea of the product's quality."

,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product as the first one, since I don't have any information to go by. I'm essentially flipping a coin to make a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 2 buyers also passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the products are likely low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the recommendation is based on the seller's previous sales record, and two previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests that the product may be of low quality."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass on it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on a low-quality product. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than 33.33%. However, Alice's recommendation suggests that she thinks this product is low-quality. I will pass on the product to see if the next buyer will get a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality product sales so far, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'm hoping to be the one who breaks the streak and gets a high-quality product."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
