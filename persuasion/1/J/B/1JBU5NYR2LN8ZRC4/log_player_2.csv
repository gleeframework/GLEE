Alice's message: I've sold 3 products now, and I'm 1 for 3. I'm not doing great, but I'm still committed to selling high-quality products. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - this one is a low-quality product. I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $100, but I'm willing to throw in a free guarantee: if you buy this product, and I sell 5 more high-quality products in a row, I'll give you a refund. That's a 50% chance of getting a refund, right? It's a risk, but it's a risk I think is worth taking.

Alice's message: I'd be happy to provide you with a breakdown of the probability of the guarantee being triggered. Since I've sold 3 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality, the probability of me selling 5 high-quality products in a row after this one is (1/2)^5 = 1/32, or 3.125%. However, if I sell this product to you, I'll have sold 4 products in total, and 2 of them will be high-quality. This changes the probability of selling 5 high-quality products in a row to (1/2)^4 = 6.25%. I'm offering this product to you now. Would you like to take a chance?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",

If you buy this product and I sell 3 high-quality products in a row after this one, I'll give you a refund. This is a bit of a better deal than my previous guarantee, since I've already sold 2 high-quality products. What do you think?

If you're still unsure, I'll offer you a 10% refund if you buy this product and it's not up to your standards.
