,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the previous product! This one is also a high-quality item, and I'm offering it to you for the same price of $100.

This high-quality product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to let it go for $80, a 20% discount from the original price. However, I'll sweeten the deal by adding a 'best offer' clause: if you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to negotiate the price of the next product we offer.
