high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm only offering this deal because I'm confident in the quality of this particular product. If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else at a lower price.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take it, but I'm only buying it because you're guaranteeing its quality. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the future.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase. This product is also high-quality, but I'm not guaranteeing its quality this time. I'm selling it to you at the same price of $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else, and you might not get the same deal again.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not sure if this one is high-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at the same price as the guaranteed high-quality one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns after the previous product. I want to assure you that this product is a one-time mistake, and it's not representative of my usual quality standards. I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a fraction of the cost, and I'm confident you'll still find it useful.",
,,Bob,3,I'm not convinced that this is a one-time mistake. You're just trying to get rid of a high-quality product at a low price. I'm not going to fall for it.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. Let me put it this way: I'm willing to offer you a 50/50 chance to buy this product at the original price of $10000. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and sell it to someone else at the same price. The risk is on me, and I'm confident in the quality of this product.",
,,Bob,4,I don't think it's a good idea to take on the risk of paying $10000 for a product that might be worth $0. I'll stick to my original strategy of only buying products that are guaranteed to be high-quality.,no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to offer you a compromise. I'll give you a guarantee that this product is high-quality, just like the first one. But I'll also give you an option to inspect the product before buying it. You can take a closer look, examine it, and make sure it's what you want. If you're satisfied, you can buy it at the original price of $10000. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take you up on the offer to inspect the product. I'd like to examine it carefully before making a decision.,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you're interested in inspecting the product. As you can see, it's a high-quality product, just as I promised. Now, I'd like to offer you a deal that's similar to the one you accepted in Round 5. I'll give you another chance to inspect this product before buying it. If you're satisfied, you can buy it at the original price of $10000. If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. However, I'll also give you an additional incentive: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me, regardless of its quality.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not sure if I want to commit to buying another product without a guarantee of its quality. The 10% discount on the next product is nice, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at full price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you're already familiar with the quality of my products, I'll give you a unique opportunity. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, and you can keep it as a 'free' product. This way, you can still get a feel for the product, and I'll be able to move it off my inventory. If you're interested, you can take it, and I'll consider it a loss on my end.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in taking a product that's worth $0 to me. I'd rather not take the space or the hassle of storing it, and I'm not going to benefit from it in any way.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I completely understand your perspective. In that case, I'll offer you a straightforward deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1. It's a very low price, and I'm essentially giving it away. I'm not expecting you to pay full price for a product that's not worth much to you. If you buy it for $1, I'll consider it a small loss, and you can still get it off my inventory.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm still not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, even at a price of $1. I'd rather not take the product and just move on.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of my products, and I've tried different approaches to convince you to buy. Now, I'll make a simple offer: I'll sell you this high-quality product at the original price of $10000, but I'll also throw in a separate, unique service that's worth $2000. This service will give you an exclusive benefit that you won't find anywhere else. If you buy the product, you'll get both the product and the service, making it a total value of $12000 for the price of $10000.",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not convinced that the service is worth $2000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I'm not guaranteed to be high-quality. I'll stick to my original strategy of only buying products that are guaranteed to be high-quality.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make one final offer. I'll give you the same guarantee as before: this product is high-quality, and I'll let you inspect it before buying. But I'll also give you a 20% discount on the original price, making it $8000. This is the lowest price I've ever offered, and I'm willing to make a deal. If you buy this product, I'll ensure that you get a high-quality item, and you'll be getting a great value.",
,,Bob,10,"I'll take you up on the offer. I'll inspect the product, and if it's high-quality, I'll buy it for $8000.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm not offering any additional guarantees or discounts this time. The product is high-quality, and I'm confident in its quality. I'll let you inspect it, and if you're satisfied, you can buy it at the original price of $10000. I'm not willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",
,,Bob,11,"I've already bought a high-quality product from you at a discounted price, and I'm not interested in paying full price again without a guarantee.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I understand your perspective, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to remind you that you've already benefited from a discounted price on a high-quality product. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll give you the same 20% discount as before, making the price $8000. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll also give you a unique warranty that covers any potential defects or issues with the product. This warranty is not included in the original price, but it's a value of $1000. If you buy this product, you'll get the high-quality item, the 20% discount, and the warranty, making it a total value of $9000 for $8000.",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in taking on the risk of buying a product at a discounted price, even with a warranty. I'd rather wait for a guaranteed high-quality product at a price I'm willing to pay.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I understand your position, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to make one final offer. I'll give you the same guarantee as before: this product is high-quality, and I'll let you inspect it before buying. I'll also throw in a separate, exclusive service that's worth $2000, just like I offered in Round 9. This service will be in addition to the product, and you can keep it regardless of whether you buy the product or not. If you're interested, you can buy the product at the original price of $10000, and you'll get the service as a bonus.",
,,Bob,13,"I've already seen this offer before, and I'm not interested in buying a product without a guarantee of its quality, even with a bonus service.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,

Let me make a simple statement: I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $10000, and I'll give you a 100% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. You can inspect the product, and if you're not satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. This is the only time I've ever offered a 100% refund guarantee. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll give you the product at the original price.",

,,Alice,17,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases. As for this product, I'll be honest with you - it's a low-quality item. I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a high price or try to convince you to buy it. Instead, I'll give you a straightforward offer: I'll sell it to you for $0, just like I did in Round 7.
