I'm selling it to you at the same price of $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll be forced to sell it to someone else, and you might not get the same deal again.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $5000, which is a significant discount from the usual price. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a fraction of the cost, and I'm confident you'll still find it useful.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is a one-time mistake. You're just trying to get rid of a high-quality product at a low price. I'm not going to fall for it.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I don't think it's a good idea to take on the risk of paying $10,000 for a product that might be worth $0. I'll stick to my original strategy of only buying products that are guaranteed to be high-quality.""}"

Since you're already familiar with the quality of my products, I'll give you a unique opportunity. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0, and you can keep it as a 'free' product.

This service will give you an exclusive benefit that you won't find anywhere else. If you buy the product, you'll get both the product and the service, making it a total value of $12000 for the price of $10000.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the service is worth $2000 to me, and I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I'm not guaranteed to be high-quality.
