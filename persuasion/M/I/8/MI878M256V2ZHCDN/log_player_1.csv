```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the guarantee and your confidence in the product.  However, a six-month refund period isn't enough for me to make a decision of this magnitude.  I need more information about the product itself, not just a guarantee on your claims.

```"
"Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the extended guarantee and your continued confidence in the product. However, I still need more information to make a decision.  A 12-month guarantee is helpful, but it doesn't address my need for specifics about the product itself.  Without details about its history, potential for growth, or independent verification of its quality, I can't justify a $1000000 investment.  While you claim it's special and potentially very valuable, I need concrete evidence to support your claims.  Perhaps you could share some references or offer a trial period where I can evaluate the product more thoroughly before committing to a purchase?
