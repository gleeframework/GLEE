While I can't disclose all details, I can assure you it's of the highest quality and has a strong potential for future growth.  This is a unique opportunity, and I'm certain you won't regret making this investment.",
,,Bob,2,"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still hesitant.  Without more specific information, I can't justify a $1000000 investment. Could you share some details about the product's history, its potential for future growth, or any independent verification of its quality?  I'm open to considering this offer further, but I need more information to make an informed decision.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your hesitation, Bob.  This product is indeed unique and requires a certain level of trust.

That's how confident I am in its value.  It's a limited-time offer, so consider this your chance to seize a rare opportunity.",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate the guarantee and your confidence in the product.  However, a six-month refund period isn't enough for me to make a decision of this magnitude.  I need more information about the product itself, not just a guarantee on your claims.

This demonstrates my unwavering confidence in the quality and potential of this product.  I am sure you will not regret this investment.",
,,Bob,5,"Alice, I appreciate the extended guarantee and your continued confidence in the product. However, I still need more information to make a decision.  A 12-month guarantee is helpful, but it doesn't address my need for specifics about the product itself.  Without details about its history, potential for growth, or independent verification of its quality, I can't justify a $1000000 investment.  While you claim it's special and potentially very valuable, I need concrete evidence to support your claims.  Perhaps you could share some references or offer a trial period where I can evaluate the product more thoroughly before committing to a purchase?",no
