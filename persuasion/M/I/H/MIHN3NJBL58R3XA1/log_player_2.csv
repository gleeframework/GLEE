**Reasoning:**

* **The information is limited:** We only know that Alice sold one high-quality product so far. This doesn't tell us much about the overall quality of her inventory. 
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product is a significant factor. Since she knows the true quality of the product, her recommendation holds weight.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $120 outweighs the potential loss of $100.

**Therefore, it's a calculated risk worth taking, especially with Alice's recommendation.**"
