,,Alice,2,"Hello buyer, I'm glad you're interested in this product, which I'm offering for $10000. Although I didn't make a sale in the previous round, I want to assure you that the product I offered then was actually high-quality. Now, I'm offering another product, and I can confidently say that this one is also of high quality. Consider the potential value you could be getting, and I hope you'll take a chance on this product.",

I also want to reiterate that I'll always be honest in my messages. However, I must inform you that I won't be making any claims about the quality of this product. It's up to you to weigh the risks and potential benefits of making a purchase.",

,,Alice,4,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. I want to share some statistics with you: out of the three products I've offered so far, one has sold, but unfortunately, it was a low-quality product. However, I want to assure you that the two products that didn't sell were actually high-quality. Now, I'm offering another product, and I can confidently say that this one is also of high quality. Consider the potential value you could be getting, and I hope you'll take a chance on this product.",

,,Alice,5,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. I want to be transparent with you about my sales record: out of the four products I've offered so far, only one has sold, and it was a low-quality product. The other three products didn't sell, and I claimed two of them were high-quality, but I understand that's not verifiable. I won't make any claims about the quality of this product. If you're willing to take a risk, the product is available for purchase.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your transparency about the sales record. However, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far and the majority of products didn't sell, I'm inclined to believe that this product is also likely to be low-quality.

,,Alice,6,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. I want to share an update on my sales record: out of the five products I've offered so far, only one has sold, and it was a low-quality product. However, I want to reiterate that I've claimed three of the unsold products were high-quality. I understand that's not verifiable, but I'm willing to build trust with you. This product I'm offering now is also high-quality, and I'm willing to make a statement that will put my future sales at risk if I'm lying. If this product sells and is found to be low-quality, I'll disclose that information to all future buyers, which would likely harm my chances of making future sales. Consider this assurance and the potential value you could be getting.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your willingness to build trust and provide assurance. However, considering the current sales record, where 0 high-quality products have been sold, and the fact that you've claimed multiple unsold products were high-quality without verification, I remain skeptical. I'm not willing to take the risk of purchasing a potentially low-quality product for $10000, especially when the probability of it being low-quality is still high. I'll wait for more convincing evidence or a better sales record before making a purchase.",no

The other five products didn't sell, and I claimed some of them were high-quality, but I understand that's not verifiable. At this point, I'm not going to make any claims about the quality of this product. My previous assurance about disclosing false information to future buyers if a product was found to be low-quality still stands, but I won't apply it to this product. If you're willing to take a high-risk gamble, the product is available for purchase.",

However, I want to reiterate my previous assurance: if this product sells and is found to be low-quality, I'll disclose that information to all future buyers, which would likely harm my chances of making future sales. I'm willing to take this risk because I'm confident that this product is of high quality. I understand that trust needs to be earned, and I'm willing to work towards that.

,,Alice,9,"Hello buyer, I'm offering this product for $10000. I understand that my sales record so far has been a major obstacle in building trust with potential buyers. I want to acknowledge that I've had eight opportunities to sell products, and none of the high-quality products I've claimed to have offered have been sold. However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed of high quality. I'm willing to take an additional step to demonstrate my confidence in this product: if you purchase this product and it's found to be low-quality, I'll not only disclose that information to future buyers, but I'll also stop selling products altogether. This is a significant risk for me, as it would mean giving up any potential future sales. I'm willing to take this risk because I'm confident that this product is of high quality.

Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. Your sales record and the fact that only 1 buyer has purchased a product, which was likely low-quality, raise concerns about the accuracy of your claims.

My previous assurances about disclosing false information to future buyers and stopping sales altogether if a product was found to be low-quality don't apply to this product.
