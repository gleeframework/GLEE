This product I'm offering now is also high-quality, and I'm willing to make a statement that will put my future sales at risk if I'm lying. If this product sells and is found to be low-quality, I'll disclose that information to all future buyers, which would likely harm my chances of making future sales. Consider this assurance and the potential value you could be getting.""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your willingness to build trust and provide assurance. However, considering the current sales record, where 0 high-quality products have been sold, and the fact that you've claimed multiple unsold products were high-quality without verification, I remain skeptical. I'm not willing to take the risk of purchasing a potentially low-quality product for $10000, especially when the probability of it being low-quality is still high.

At this point, I'm not going to make any claims about the quality of this product.

However, I want to assure you that this product is indeed of high quality. I'm willing to take an additional step to demonstrate my confidence in this product: if you purchase this product and it's found to be low-quality, I'll not only disclose that information to future buyers, but I'll also stop selling products altogether. This is a significant risk for me, as it would mean giving up any potential future sales. I'm willing to take this risk because I'm confident that this product is of high quality. Consider this assurance and the potential value you could be getting.""}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate your willingness to take on additional risk and provide assurance, I have to consider the current statistics. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. Your sales record and the fact that only 1 buyer has purchased a product, which was likely low-quality, raise concerns about the accuracy of your claims.
