Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As a seller, your goal is to maximize profit. In this case, you know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows you are generally trustworthy (80% of your products are high-quality). Since there's no information about the buyer's specific valuation of a high-quality product,  it's reasonable to recommend the purchase. The buyer is likely to accept, given the high probability of a good deal."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first product and there's no data yet, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it.  I'll trust your recommendation for now.
