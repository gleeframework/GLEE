high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not going to take the risk based on Alice's recommendation. The fact that she's recommending it after 3 other buyers passed on it makes me think it's likely to be low quality.

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts. The probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but the probability of a low-quality product is 66.67%. Given the low success rate so far, I'm not confident in the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more data or a different product."
