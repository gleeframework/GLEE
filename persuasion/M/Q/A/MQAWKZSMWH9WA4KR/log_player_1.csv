"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping that you're right, and the quality is random. I'm also considering the fact that I'm the 4th buyer, and so far, no high-quality products have been sold.

I don't have any information about what made those products high-quality, but I can tell you that they were all bought after a streak of low-quality products.

I think it's time for me to come clean: I've been trying to convince you all that the quality of my products is random, but the truth is, I don't actually know what determines the quality of my products. I'm just as likely to sell a high-quality product as a low-quality one, and I'm willing to sell this next one to you at the standard price of $100.

Would you like to take a chance and see if I can surprise you with a high-quality product?""}"
