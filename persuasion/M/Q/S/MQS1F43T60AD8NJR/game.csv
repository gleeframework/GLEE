high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy, and neither of them found a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

high-quality,125.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, so I'm inclined to think the current product is also low-quality. I'd like to pass on it to avoid the loss."
