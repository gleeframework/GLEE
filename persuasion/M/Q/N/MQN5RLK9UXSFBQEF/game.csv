,,the buyer,2,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm also curious about the quality of the product. Please reveal its quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to think I'm just having a streak of bad luck. But I'm still confident that this next one will be a winner! After all, the law of averages is on my side, right? This one's still a great deal at $10000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your optimism, Alice. With 2 low-quality products sold in a row, I'm not willing to take the risk. I'll pass on this one.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this is just a minor setback. I've sold a total of 2 low-quality products out of how many total products I've sold?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I completely understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Let me put it this way: I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, which means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually higher than you think. With a 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, the odds are in your favor. This one's still a great deal at $10000. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not convinced by your argument. With 3 low-quality products in a row, I think it's more likely that the next product is also low-quality. I'd rather pass on this one and wait for more information.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold a total of 4 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product, out of a total of 6 products.

However, I'm still confident that this one's a great deal at $10000. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a price that's below its true value, and I think you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your reassurance, Alice. With the statistics you provided, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed lower than initially mentioned.

As you can see, the sequence is a bit streaky, but I'm glad to say that the last product I sold was high-quality.
