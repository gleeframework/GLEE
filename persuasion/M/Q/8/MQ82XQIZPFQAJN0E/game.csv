low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, as there's no prior data to influence my decision. I'm not aware of any recommendation from Alice, so I'll proceed with a neutral perspective."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it, but I'd like to understand the reasoning behind your recommendation and the probability calculation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I will not buy it. This suggests that the product might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a product that is only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low success rate of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'd also like to know the proportion of high-quality products that have been sold so far. Could you provide that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendations, but I'll take a chance and buy the product anyway. I'm hoping it's a high-quality one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you have no information about my valuation and you're likely recommending products based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which is 0%"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the previous buyers were likely getting low-quality products and the recommendation is biased. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards encouraging sales, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. The fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it? Is it because of the statistics or something else? I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, but I want to know your reasoning."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to buy without seeing more information about the previous sales record.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the low probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced by the statistics, and I think I can make a profit regardless of the product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, considering the 6 previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious about the overall proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think the low-quality products are being overrepresented in the sales record. I believe the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is higher than 33.33% due to the previous 6 buyers passing on the products. I'm hoping to take advantage of this opportunity."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, given that 7 out of 7 previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
