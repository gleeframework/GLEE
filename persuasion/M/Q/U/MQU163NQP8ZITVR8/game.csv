,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it!"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one sale and no high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality and the fact that you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is significantly lower than the true probability of 33.33%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the probabilities, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendations are based on the product's quality, but rather on the information you have about my preferences. I'd like to make my own decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 buyers have already passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm suspicious that the product is likely to be low-quality. Additionally, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet suggests that Alice's recommendations might not be reliable. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. Can you provide more information on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, and what's the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know why you're recommending against buying the product. Is it because you think it's low-quality based on past sales statistics?
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the statistics. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, but I'd like to know the odds of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that none of the previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy actually got a high-quality product, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather wait for a recommendation to pass or for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping that the low quality products have been sold first, increasing the chances of this being a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product, and also, I'd like to see the statistics of the previous 6 buyers, including how many high-quality products were offered to them and how many of those were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision."
