,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm confident in its quality and I'm willing to offer a 20% discount for this round only, bringing the price down to $800000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can finalize the sale.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to pay $800000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low quality. I'd like to pass and wait for the next round.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1000000. You won't lose a single dollar. This way, you're essentially buying a product with a 100% chance of being high-quality, and you can try it out risk-free. The price remains at $1000000. What do you think?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in the guarantee. I know the product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or more information about the product.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm willing to make a bet with you. I'll offer you a 2-for-1 deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you the next product for free, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get two products for the price of one, and you can try to sell the low-quality product or keep it as a backup. The price remains at $1000000 for the first product, and the second product is free. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in the 2-for-1 deal. Even with the potential for a free product, I'm still paying $1000000 for a product that has a 20% chance of being low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or more information about the product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm offering you a product that I'm willing to sell to you for $1000000. I know this product is low-quality, and I'm not trying to hide it. I'm giving you complete transparency. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's significantly lower than its true value, which I'm sure you'll agree is $0. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in buying a product that you're admitting is low-quality. I'd be throwing away $500000 on something that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've been transparent about the quality of the previous product, and I'm willing to do the same for this one. However, I'm not going to reveal its quality just yet. I'll give you a hint: the quality of this product is the opposite of the previous one. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll sell it to you for $1000000. If you're not interested, I'll reveal its quality and you can decide then.",
,,Bob,5,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. Given that the previous product was low-quality, I'm hoping this one will be high-quality. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on making a great decision earlier! I'm glad you took a chance on the previous product. Now, I'll give you a more detailed breakdown of the value of this product. I've done some research and found that high-quality products like this one are typically worth $1200000 to buyers like you. Considering the original price of $1000000, I'm offering you a 17% discount, bringing the price down to $830000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in the discount. I already know the product is high-quality and I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. The 17% discount is nice, but it's not enough to sway me from my target price.",no

I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal, and I'm looking forward to continuing our business relationship.",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not interested in the loyalty discount. I've already paid $1125000 for the last high-quality product, and I'm not willing to go back to the original price of $1000000 for a third high-quality product. I'd like to negotiate a better price or wait for the next round.",no

Since you've already won a valuable prize, I'll sell you this high-quality product for the same price as the lottery ticket, which is $250000.
