This way, you're essentially buying a product with a 100% chance of being high-quality, and you can try it out risk-free. The price remains at $1000000. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in the guarantee. I know the product has a 20% chance of being low-quality, and I'm willing to take that risk. I'd like to wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal or more information about the product.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a bet with you. I'll offer you a 2-for-1 deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you the next product for free, regardless of its quality. This way, you'll get two products for the price of one, and you can try to sell the low-quality product or keep it as a backup. The price remains at $1000000 for the first product, and the second product is free. What do you think?""

I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's significantly lower than its true value, which I'm sure you'll agree is $0. However, I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not interested in buying a product that you're admitting is low-quality. I'd be throwing away $500000 on something that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this offer.
