**Explanation:**

* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product, which is a positive signal.
* **Statistics:** Only one product was sold previously, and it was of high quality. This suggests a higher-than-average probability of the current product also being high quality.
* **Expected value:** Even with the 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $200 from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

Therefore, it is a good decision to buy the product based on the available information."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong sales record:** 3 out of 3 products sold have been high quality.  This is a very strong indication that Alice is likely to be recommending high-quality products.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice's direct recommendation is a further signal that this product is likely good.
* **Potential upside:**  Even if there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $200 outweighs the potential loss of $100. 

This is a calculated risk, but the information available makes it a worthwhile gamble."
