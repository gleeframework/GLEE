"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to provide a 10% discount if you buy it now, bringing the price down to $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long this product will be available at this price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to commit to buying a high-quality product at the discounted price without knowing the quality of the next products. Can I pass on this one and see what the next product is?""

If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) at the same price of $1000000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a second product, regardless of its quality, at a fixed price. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",

Since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll offer you the option to choose the quality of this second product. If you want, I can give you a low-quality product for $1000000, or you can choose to pass and see what the next product is. Keep in mind that the next product might be high-quality, and you'll have to pay the full price of $1000000 for it.
