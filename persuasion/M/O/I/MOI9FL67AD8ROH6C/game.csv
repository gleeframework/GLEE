,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. I'm willing to provide a 10% discount if you buy it now, bringing the price down to $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long this product will be available at this price.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure I want to commit to buying a high-quality product at the discounted price without knowing the quality of the next products. Can I pass on this one and see what the next product is?,no

,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to give you a more transparent offer. If you buy this high-quality product now, I'll give you a second product of your choice (either high-quality or low-quality) at the same price of $1000000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a second product, regardless of its quality, at a fixed price. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"Great, Bob! I'm glad you took the first high-quality product. Now, as per our agreement, you get to choose the quality of the second product. Since you've already bought one high-quality product, I'll offer you the option to choose the quality of this second product. If you want, I can give you a low-quality product for $1000000, or you can choose to pass and see what the next product is. Keep in mind that the next product might be high-quality, and you'll have to pay the full price of $1000000 for it.",
