However, I must admit that the evaluation process is subjective, and the merits I see in a product might not be immediately apparent to others. Out of the seven products offered previously, two were high-quality, but neither of them was sold. The four sold products were low-quality.

You are correct that all four sold products were low-quality, which may suggest a bias in the selection process. However, I assure you that the selection process is not intentionally biased towards low-quality products. I can tell you that I'm bound by certain constraints that affect the selection process, but I'm not at liberty to disclose more information. Out of the nine products offered previously, two were high-quality, but neither of them was sold. The four sold products were low-quality.

I appreciate their diligence and willingness to consider the available information. Out of the twelve products offered previously, three were high-quality, but none of them were sold. The six sold products were low-quality. However, I want to inform you that the product I'm offering now is a new opportunity, and I encourage you to consider it based on its own merits.

I want to acknowledge the thoughtful question asked by the previous buyer about the relationship between product quality and sales. While I don't have a definitive answer, I can tell you that the data suggests a correlation between the two. Out of the thirteen products offered previously, three were high-quality, and one of them was sold in the previous round. The six other sold products were low-quality. It's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is not independent of its sale, and I encourage you to consider this when making your decision. Would you like to take this product home for $1000000?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'd like to point out that the correlation you mentioned might be due to chance. With a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, we'd expect to see 4.33 high-quality products out of 13, assuming independence. The fact that we've seen only 1 high-quality product sold so far is consistent with this expectation. I'd like to pass on this product and observe more data before making a decision.

They correctly pointed out that the observed correlation could be due to chance, and that the data is still consistent with the assumption of independence. I appreciate their cautious approach and willingness to consider alternative explanations. Out of the fourteen products offered previously, three were high-quality, and one of them was sold. The seven other sold products were low-quality. I encourage you to consider the available data and make an informed decision. Would you like to take this product home for $1000000?""}"
