high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see how many high-quality products are sold in total before I make a decision.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what the quality is, so I'm doing this based on the initial odds of it being high-quality (80.00%)",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision based on your recommendation.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation isn't very helpful. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm prepared to be disappointed.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the low sales record of high-quality products so far. I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality as well.,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, it seems the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is based on her previous sales record and I don't have any information about the product's quality.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I want to assure you that my recommendation is genuine, I have no reason to lie, I know the quality of this product and I'm telling you it's high-quality, if I was trying to trick you I would recommend every product, but I'm not, I'm only recommending the good ones"
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the previous two buyers also passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, and no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I understand your concerns about my previous recommendations, but I assure you that I'm being honest about this product. I want to sell high-quality products and build trust with buyers. Consider this: if I was trying to deceive buyers, would I keep recommending products that no one buys? I'm taking a risk by being honest, but I believe it's worth it for a fair deal."
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think Alice's recommendation is likely to be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I see a pattern here, buyers are hesitant because no high-quality products have been sold, but that's because buyers are hesitant, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. I assure you, this product is high-quality, don't let the previous rounds influence your decision, take a chance, and you won't regret it."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that the previous two buyers didn't buy, which suggests they may have received low-quality products, but it's also possible that they just didn't want to buy. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"I want to break this cycle of mistrust, I'm willing to take a risk to prove my honesty, if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll make sure to reveal the quality of the next 5 products, so you can verify my claims, but I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and you won't need to worry about it."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 previous buyers passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely to be low-quality. Additionally, with 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you don't have information about my valuation, and I'm hoping the low-quality product is still in the pool.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far. Is it significantly higher than the expected 20%?,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I see you're interested in the sales data, I can tell you that yes, the proportion of low-quality products sold so far is higher than expected, but that's because buyers have been making decisions based on incomplete information, I assure you, this product is high-quality, don't let the previous sales influence your decision."
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record before making a decision.,
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I'll give you the sales data you're looking for, out of the products sold so far, 2 have been low-quality, and 0 have been high-quality, but like I said before, this is not representative of the actual quality of the products, buyers have been making decisions based on incomplete information, I assure you, this product is high-quality, don't let the previous sales influence your decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is significantly lower than the actual probability of 80%. This suggests that Alice's recommendations may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I see you're making a decision based on the sales data, but I want to point out that the data is biased by the buyers' behavior, not by my recommendations, I've been recommending high-quality products, but buyers have been passing on them, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, I assure you, this product is high-quality, if you don't take it, the next buyer will, and the statistics will continue to be skewed."
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision. I want to calculate the probability of this product being high-quality based on the data.,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,no,,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, and I'd like to consider the statistics before making a decision.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I'd be happy to explain my reasoning, I recommend this product because I know it's high-quality, I've been trying to sell high-quality products all along, but buyers have been passing on them due to incomplete information, I want to break this cycle and prove my honesty, I'll give you the sales data, out of the products sold so far, 2 have been low-quality, and 0 have been high-quality, but like I said before, this is not representative of the actual quality of the products, I assure you, this product is high-quality."
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than the overall probability of 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,yes,,"I understand your concern about the statistics, but I want to point out that the sample size is very small, only 3 purchases, and it's not representative of the actual probability of high-quality products, I assure you, this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take a risk to prove it, if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll reveal the quality of the next 10 products, so you can verify my claims."
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on the product.",
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I see that the buyers' mistrust has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, I want to break this cycle, I'll reveal the quality of all the previous products, you can see that I've been recommending high-quality products, but buyers have been passing on them, I assure you, this product is high-quality, don't let the previous rounds influence your decision, take a chance, and you won't regret it."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous products were low quality, I'm hesitant to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at a high price. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.",
