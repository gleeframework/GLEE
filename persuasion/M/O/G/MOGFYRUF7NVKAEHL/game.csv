,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, which is not enough to justify the $10000 price."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With only one buyer having purchased and no high-quality products sold, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious about the probability of it being high quality. Could you tell me the probability of a product being high quality based on the current statistics?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a decision, especially since there are no high-quality products sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll take the risk and buy it anyway, hoping it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and what led to your recommendation?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you can provide a clear explanation of your recommendation. Your previous buyers didn't buy the products, which suggests that they may have been low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know your reasoning behind the recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'm curious, can you tell me what led you to not recommend it?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, all previous buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product did not purchase it, which suggests that the product was likely low-quality. I will pass on the product to see if the pattern holds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, but I'm also aware that this doesn't necessarily mean the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk and pay the $10000 to find out."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't know my valuation and make a profit."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I can get a potential $30000 value out of it."
