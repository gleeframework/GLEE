I'm offering this product to you for the same price of $1000000, and I'm confident it's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price compared to what it's worth.

Alice's message: Congratulations to you and the previous buyer for getting two high-quality products in a row! However, I must correct you - the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, and it's not necessarily a discounted price. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'd like to remind you that the previous buyers who purchased high-quality products had no way of knowing the quality beforehand.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! However, I'd like to remind you that the previous three buyers who purchased from me got high-quality products. While the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%, the fact that we've had three high-quality products in a row might suggest that the next one could be low-quality. On the other hand, it's also possible that we're just experiencing a streak. The price remains at $1000000, and I'm confident you'll make a great decision.
