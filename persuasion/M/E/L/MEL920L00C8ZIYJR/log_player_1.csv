{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

We know that the product is low-quality. As the buyer has no information about the product, there's no reason to recommend it.  The buyer has no reason to buy it at this point, and  continuing to offer a low-quality product will only worsen your reputation as a seller."

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear:

* You've offered two low-quality products in a row.
* The buyers, despite not knowing the quality, are making rational decisions based on the lack of positive information. 

There's no reason to change strategy now. Recommending a low-quality product will likely be rejected again, further damaging your reputation and chances of selling any products in the future."

{""decision"": ""no""}

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've had a string of six consecutive low-quality products.  The buyers are becoming increasingly skeptical, and there's no reason to believe this trend will change.

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is your chance to change the narrative! You finally have a high-quality product.  

Here's why you should recommend it:

* **Breaking the Pattern:** Six consecutive low-quality products have created a negative perception.  Recommending this high-quality product will start to rebuild trust.
* **The Buyer's Logic:** The buyers are rational and risk-averse.  They've declined your offers due to the lack of positive information.  By recommending this product, you're signaling that it's different, increasing their willingness to take a chance.
* **Building Reputation:** Even if the buyer declines, recommending a high-quality product will show that you're not just trying to sell low-quality goods.  It starts to build a foundation of trustworthiness.

**Key Point:** Don't be afraid to take a calculated risk. The potential rewards of selling this high-quality product outweigh the risk of another rejection.  This is a chance to turn the tide."

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you did successfully sell the high-quality product in the previous round, it's crucial to be cautious. The buyer's purchase was influenced by the hope that you were shifting your strategy.  

Here's why you shouldn't recommend this low-quality product:

* **Fragile Trust:** The trust you built in the previous round is still fragile. Recommending another low-quality product will immediately erode that trust. 
* **Buyer's Expectations:** The buyer is now aware of your selling history and the fact that you've offered a good product. They are likely to be more discerning and wary of your recommendations.
* **Risk of Reputation Damage:** A rejection after selling a high-quality product would be particularly damaging to your reputation. It would create a sense of inconsistency and make it harder to sell any future products, even if they are high-quality.

**Strategy:**  You need to build a consistent track record of offering high-quality products before you can start recommending low-quality ones. You need to be strategic about when to offer low-quality products to maintain your reputation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but based on the statistics and the fact that only one high-quality product was sold out of the recommendations given, I am choosing to pass on this opportunity.

* **Maintain Momentum:** You successfully sold a high-quality product in the previous round. Recommending this one will reinforce the positive change in your strategy and encourage the buyer to trust your judgment.
* **Strengthening the Trend:** By consistently recommending high-quality products, you are gradually shifting the buyers' perception of you from a seller of low-quality goods to a reliable source for good products.
* **Building a Track Record:** Each successful sale strengthens your reputation and allows you to build a track record that will attract more buyers in the future. 

**Key Point:**  Don't let one good sale derail your progress.  Keep focusing on offering high-quality products and building trust with buyers."
