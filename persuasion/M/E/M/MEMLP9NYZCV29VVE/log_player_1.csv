What do you say?""}"
"The buyer's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm more interested in the probability of getting a high-quality product. With 4 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is indeed 80%.

The probability of this product being high-quality is 54.55%, based on the sales record.

However, I want to make it clear that I'm not obligated to continue selling at this price. If you're interested in buying this high-quality product for $10,000, I'll sell it to you.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I'm glad you're interested in the math behind the probability. I calculated the probability of this product being high-quality based on the sales record, which is 6 high-quality products out of 12 total products sold. This gives us a probability of 50%. However, I've been selling products for 14 rounds, and the probability of a product being high-quality has been consistently above 50% in the first half of the rounds.
