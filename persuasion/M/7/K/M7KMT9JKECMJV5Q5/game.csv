,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product. I'm willing to let it go for $100, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to you. If you're interested, I can give you a better product in the next round, but if you pass, I'll give you a worse one.",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take the low-quality product for $100, thank you!",yes
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're getting a great deal this round! This product is of the highest quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I have to warn you, the next product I have might be a dud.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You just got a great high-quality product last round, so I'm guessing you're feeling pretty good about your purchase. I'm offering you another product for $100, but I have to be honest with you, this one is not as good as the last one. It's a low-quality product, and I'm not sure if it's worth your money.",
,,Bob,3,"I think I'll pass on this one, thanks for the heads up, but I'm not interested in a low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're being cautious, and I don't blame you. I'm offering you another product for $100, and I'll be upfront with you - it's another low-quality one. However, I'll give you a hint: if you buy this one, I'll make sure to give you a high-quality product next round, and it's a really good one.",
,,Bob,4,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm not interested in another low-quality product, and I'm not sure I believe the promise of a high-quality product next round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for being cautious. However, I'm willing to make it worth your while. If you buy this low-quality product for $100, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you buy the next product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a full refund for this one. That way, you'll essentially get the high-quality product for free.",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I think I've made my point about the low-quality products, and I'm glad you're holding out for a high-quality one. This product is indeed the good stuff. I'm offering it to you for $100, and I'm willing to make a deal: if you buy this one, I'll give you a special deal on the next product - I'll let you name the price for it. You can get it for whatever you think it's worth.",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the high-quality product for $100, and I'll name the price for the next one - let's say $0, since I've already gotten a good deal on the last one!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Well played, Bob! You got a great deal on the last one, and now you're getting a high-quality product for $100. This time, I'm offering you another product for $100, but I'll be honest with you - it's not as good as the last two. However, I'm willing to give you a chance to 'invest' in this product. If you buy it, I'll give you a chance to sell it back to me for $150 at the end of the 20 rounds, if you're not happy with it.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a potentially low-quality product and then trying to sell it back to you. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're sticking to your guns, and I respect that. This product is indeed low-quality, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. However, I want to make it worth your while to consider buying it. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' - you get to peek at the quality of the next product before I offer it to you. You can decide whether to buy it or not, based on what you see.",

,,Alice,10,"You've got two high-quality products in a row, and now I'm offering you another one for $100. However, I have to be honest with you - I've already broken my guarantee once (this product is low-quality). I'm not asking you to take it, but I want to make it worth your while to consider it. If you buy this product, I'll give you a chance to'steal' the next product - you can buy it for $0, and I'll give you a high-quality product for free.",

However, I want to give you one last chance to buy it for $100. If you do, I'll give you a refund of $50, so you'll only pay $50 for a low-quality product. It's a low-risk option, but it's still a low-quality product.",
,,Bob,12,"I appreciate the refund offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a lower price. I'll pass on this one.",no
