"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), the potential gain from a high-quality product ($40,000) is significant. The recommendation from Alice adds some information, but it's not enough to drastically change the odds.  In the long run, buying consistently is likely to result in a positive return."

Round 2

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take another one! Thanks for the recommendation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The first round was a success.  Alice's recommendation seems to be a good indicator of quality.  Given the potential reward ($40,000) and the fact that the cost ($10,000) is significantly lower, buying again seems like the best strategy."

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the honesty, but I'll pass on this one. Perhaps the next one will be better.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is now a negative factor.  While there's always a chance of a good product, the odds are now skewed towards low quality. Since the cost is high and the potential loss is significant, it's wiser to pass on this product and wait for a more promising opportunity."

```

**Reasoning:**
