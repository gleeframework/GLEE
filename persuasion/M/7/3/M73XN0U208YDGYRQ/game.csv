high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on this product and see the next one. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality based on the fact that no products have been sold yet.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend it?"
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm taking a calculated risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product that others have missed out on."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, and that 4 out of 4 previous buyers also didn't buy the products, it seems like all the products so far have been low-quality. I'll pass on this one as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy the product, based on the fact that you don't recommend it and the low sales record of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if I can beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not going to buy it. The fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers purchased the products despite Alice's recommendations, and none of them were high-quality, makes me suspicious. It seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This makes me skeptical of the current product's quality, and I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the statistics and Alice's recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, it's likely that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased, making it less likely that this product is high-quality. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy it. I think the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers were able to get a high-quality product suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product for $100."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the products sold were low-quality, which would mean that there's a higher chance that the product offered to me is also low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the statistics, 5 out of 5 products have been low-quality, which is a strong indication that the product is likely low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
