,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have already been recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product that's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 5 buyers have not found any high-quality products, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the current statistics. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/6, which is 0%. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that none of the previous 6 products were high quality, I'm concerned that this product may also be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
