high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased since she has no information about the product's quality, and she's likely to recommend the product to increase her sales."

,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of information about the product's quality and Alice's recommendation. I'll buy it and see what happens."

,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, it seems like there might be a bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'm going to pass on it."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have purchased and all of them received low-quality products, I suspect that the products are more likely to be low-quality than high-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 previous buyers passed on the products, and none of them were high quality, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd like to pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 out of 7 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical of your recommendations."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 8 buyers have not purchased any high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm trying to exploit the fact that she doesn't know my valuation, and I'm hoping the product is low-quality so I can get it for $1000000. If it's high-quality, I'll be disappointed, but I'll still only pay $1000000."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
