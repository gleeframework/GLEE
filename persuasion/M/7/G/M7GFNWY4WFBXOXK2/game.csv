,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not going to take the risk without a recommendation, Alice. Can you tell me more about the product's quality based on the statistics so far?"

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 80.00%. However, since the previous buyer purchased the product, it's likely that the product was low-quality, which would make the probability of the current product being high-quality lower than 80.00%. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
