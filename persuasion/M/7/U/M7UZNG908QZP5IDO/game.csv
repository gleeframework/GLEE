high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I don't have any information about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I'd like to know if the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product or not, and I'd like to see the updated statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your recommendation and the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the information that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not doing it blindly."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to estimate the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you're not recommending it, which suggests it might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $10000, which is still a good deal for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers did not buy the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'm going to pass on it to see if it's indeed low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/5, which is a very low proportion. However, I'd like to consider the possibility that this is just a coincidence and the true proportion of high-quality products might be higher. I'd like to take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: with 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the total number of products offered and the proportion of high-quality products in the previous sales, as well as the number of high-quality products remaining in the pool."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the total number of products sold so far to update my assessment of the probability of a product being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 7, which is 0%. This suggests that the product may have a low chance of being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given the current statistics and your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests a higher likelihood of low-quality products, and I don't want to risk wasting my $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm going to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 7 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them bought a high-quality product, I'm going to infer that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'm going to pass on this product to get more information about the quality distribution."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity or more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation suggests there may be a pattern of low-quality products, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that there have been 7 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low quality product rate is higher than expected, and I'm getting a good deal."
