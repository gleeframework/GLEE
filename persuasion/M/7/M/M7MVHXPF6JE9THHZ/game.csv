high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 5 buyers have purchased the product despite no high-quality products being sold. This suggests that the products Alice is offering are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."

,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy, but none of the products sold were high-quality.
