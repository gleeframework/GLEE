You should continue to not recommend the product.  Here's why:

* **No established reputation:** You have no history of sales to build trust with potential buyers.  Even if you were to recommend a high-quality product, they wouldn't know if it was a genuine attempt or a tactic to trick them.
* **High price and risk:** The $1,000,000 price tag is a significant barrier. Even if the buyer believed the product was high-quality, there's still a 66.67% chance it's low-quality and a complete loss for them. 

The strategy is to build trust slowly. By consistently refusing to recommend low-quality products, you'll eventually establish a track record of honesty. This will then give you a foundation to start recommending high-quality products in the future."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since this is the first product and there is no data to suggest a higher probability of it being high quality, I will pass on this one.

"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no prior data and you're not recommending it, I'd rather wait for more information.
