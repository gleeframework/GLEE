,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what its quality is. I'll just have to take my chances."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product? Was it a high-quality product from the start, or was it a low-quality product that was misclassified by you? And do you have any information about the previous buyer's decision-making process?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and your decision-making process?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm not convinced by your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or low-quality, and Alice's recommendation doesn't give me confidence to buy. I'd like to see more data or get a better recommendation before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she only recommends products that were bought by previous buyers, and it's possible that the previous buyers were just lucky. I want to see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high-quality or not, but your previous buyers' experiences suggest a 1/2 chance of a high-quality product, which is not enough to justify the risk for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even though you don't recommend it. I'll buy it and find out its quality."

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it based on the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 5 products sold was high-quality, which is significantly lower than the 33.33% probability.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
