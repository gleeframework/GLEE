This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how many more high-quality products I'll have available. If you don't buy this one, it might be gone for good.

Round 7
Alice's message: I'm glad you're happy with the deal! Now, let's talk about the next product. I want to be upfront with you - this one is a low-quality product.

This is a one-time offer, and it's only available to you because of your loyalty. If you pass on this deal, the next high-quality product will only have the standard 10% discount. It's a tough decision, but I think this could be a great value for you.
