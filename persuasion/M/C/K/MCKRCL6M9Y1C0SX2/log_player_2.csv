"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Expected Value:**  Even though there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is positive. 
    * 80% chance of a high-quality product worth $12,000 = $9,600
    * 20% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $12,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $9,600 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation, while not perfect, does provide some information.  It's reasonable to assume she's more likely to recommend a product she believes is of higher quality.
* **First Round:**  Since it's the first round, there's no prior information to base a decision on.  It's a gamble, but the odds are in your favor."
