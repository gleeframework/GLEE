Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. However, I want to give you some context. As you know, I've already sold one high-quality product for $1000000. Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, it's likely that I have a high-quality product left in my inventory.

Alice's message: You're aware that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. Given that I've sold two products so far, and only one of them was high-quality, it's likely that I have a low-quality product in my inventory. In fact, it's more likely than not that the next product I show you will be low-quality.
