,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that Alice's recommendations are not reliable.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it because of the low sales record of high-quality products so far?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk.
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given the statistics, it seems that all the previous products were low-quality. I'd like to see a more convincing recommendation before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be based on anything. I'm willing to take a chance and hope for the best."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product, I'm suspicious that all 5 products were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely lower than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'll pass on the product to see if it's indeed low-quality, which would update the statistics and potentially make it more likely for future buyers to make informed decisions."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 5 buyers before me and no high-quality products sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
