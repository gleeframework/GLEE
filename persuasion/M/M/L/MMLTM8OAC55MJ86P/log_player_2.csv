**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:**  We don't know the true quality of this specific product, only that Alice is recommending it.
* **Prior Information:**  The seller has a perfect track record so far (100% high-quality products sold). 
* **Risk/Reward:** While there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product (worth $0), there's an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product (worth $120). The potential reward outweighs the risk.

**Strategy:** Since the seller has a perfect record and the potential gain is significant, it's worth taking the risk in this case."

**Explanation:**

* **The data:**  15 buyers have purchased, and 9 of those were high-quality. This means a 60% (9/15) success rate for buying a high-quality product.
* **Alice's recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is valuable as she knows the true quality of the product. 
* **The odds:** While the inherent probability of a high-quality product is 80%, the actual track record is 60%. This is still significantly higher than the risk of a low-quality product.

**Decision:** Given the positive track record and Alice's recommendation, it makes sense to buy the product. The potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk of a low-quality product, especially since the seller's recommendation suggests it's likely a good one."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:**  11 out of 17 buyers (approximately 65%) who followed Alice's recommendations ended up with high-quality products. This is significantly higher than the baseline 80% chance of a product being high-quality.
* **Alice's Knowledge:** Alice knows the true quality of each product, so her recommendations are likely based on this knowledge. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product at $120 is very attractive. 

**In conclusion, the high success rate of Alice's recommendations and her knowledge of the products make it worth the risk to purchase the current product.**"
