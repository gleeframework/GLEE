low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm trying to exploit the fact that you know the value of the product to me, but I don't have any information about the quality of the product yet. Since you've recommended against it, I'm guessing the product is likely to be low quality, but I'll still take the risk."

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which would only be worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation is likely to be influenced by her knowledge of my valuation of the product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, it's likely that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends to be passed, which would indicate that the product is likely to be low-quality, and then I can buy it at a lower price."
