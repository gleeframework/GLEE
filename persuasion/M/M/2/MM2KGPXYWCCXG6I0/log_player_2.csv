"Round 1
Alice's message: This is a one-time offer, a high-quality product worth $12000. Buy now and get a 20% discount on the next 10 rounds.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm not committing to the discount offer. I'll make my own decisions for the next 10 rounds.""}"
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice's message: You've already taken advantage of the one-time offer, so the discount is off the table. However, I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is significantly lower than 33.33%. If you buy now, you'll be getting a great deal.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying anything based on your hint. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 3
Alice's message: You passed on the previous high-quality product, but now I'm offering you another high-quality one. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by revealing that this is the second high-quality product in a row. The probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, but the law of averages suggests that the next product is more likely to be low-quality. Buy now and take advantage of this opportunity.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not buying based on the law of averages. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 4
Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, I like that. I'll give you a different approach. I'll make a prediction: I think you'll regret passing on this high-quality product. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at the full price of $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll be left with a low-quality product, and we'll both lose out on a good deal. Take a chance and buy this one.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not influenced by your prediction. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 5
Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, I respect that. Let's focus on the numbers. You've passed on three high-quality products in a row. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but you've already seen that it's possible to get a high-quality product in four consecutive rounds. If you buy this one, you'll have a 4-in-a-row streak, which is a rare occurrence. It's worth considering the potential benefits of this streak.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not swayed by the streak. I'll pass on this one.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,000 for you.

Round 6
Alice's message: You're a cautious buyer, and I don't blame you. Given that you've passed on the previous three high-quality products, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy for this product. If you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, you can return it and get your $10000 back. This way, you can try it out without any risk.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the concession, but I'm not buying anything with a no-questions-asked return policy. It's still a low-quality product 66.67% of the time, and I'm not interested in taking on that risk.""}"
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the return policy. Let me try a different approach. Since you've already passed on several high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'take-it-or-leave-it' deal. I'll give you a 50% discount on this low-quality product, and you can buy it for $5000. It's a low-risk opportunity to get a product at a significantly discounted price.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price.""}"

Round 8
Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, I respect that. Let me offer you a different kind of deal. I'll give you a chance to 'lock in' the high-quality product price for the next 5 rounds. If you buy this one, I'll guarantee that the next 5 products you buy will be at the full price of $10000 each. If you don't buy this one, the price will go back to the usual $10000, and you'll have to take your chances on the quality of the next products.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in locking in a high price for potentially low-quality products. I'll pass on this one.""}"

Round 9
Alice's message: You're a strategic buyer, I like that. Let me offer you a more flexible deal. I'll give you the option to 'bundle' this high-quality product with the next one. If you buy this product now, you can choose to buy the next product at a discounted price of $8000. It's a chance to get two high-quality products at a lower total cost than buying them separately.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the current product, and I'll wait for the next one to decide on the bundle deal.""}"

Alice's message: You've got the current high-quality product, and now you're waiting for the next one. I'll remind you that you had a chance to buy the previous high-quality product in Round 4, but you passed on it. I'm willing to offer you a'make-up' deal on this low-quality product. If you buy it now, I'll give you a $1000 credit towards the next product, which will be sold at the discounted price of $8000.
