,,Alice,5,"I've sold 0 out of 5 products, and I'm starting to think I might be having a rough streak. But don't worry, this product is a great opportunity to break the curse! It's a chance to buy a product at a low price, and I'm only asking for $100. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product with an unknown quality at this point, especially since I know the product is worth $0 to me if it's low quality.

,,the buyer,7,"I'll take a chance on breaking your losing streak! I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think it's a low-risk opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

But I'm still offering it to you for $100, and I'll throw in a special deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 20% discount on your next purchase.

,,Alice,13,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 12 attempts, and 4 attempts were low-quality products. The remaining 5 attempts were not sold. As for my sales strategy, I've been analyzing my data and I think I've found a pattern: I tend to sell high-quality products in the middle of the day, and low-quality products in the morning and evening. I'm not sure why this is, but I'm hoping it's just a coincidence. I'm offering you this high-quality product for $100, and I'll give you a special deal: if you buy it, I'll send you a detailed report on my sales data, including the times of day when I sell high-quality and low-quality products.

I'll also consider the fact that 2 out of 3 buyers who purchased so far were able to get high-quality products. I'm not sure I want to take the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially since I won't have the chance to pass on it if I don't like it.",no

,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your commitment to transparency and honesty. I'm willing to take the chance on this high-quality product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not buying it solely based on your promise.
