**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The sales record indicates that 100% of the products sold have been high-quality. 
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable information. Since she knows the true quality of each product, she has a strong incentive to recommend only high-quality products to maximize her sales.

While there is still a chance the current product is low-quality, the combination of Alice's recommendation and the historical data makes it a worthwhile risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **High success rate:**  Alice has a 100% success rate in recommending high-quality products so far (3/3). 
* **No downside:**  Even if the product turns out to be low quality, I lose nothing since it's worth $0 to me. 
* **Potential for profit:** There's a strong chance the product is high quality, in which case I'd make a $25 profit.

This strategy maximizes the potential for profit while minimizing risk."
