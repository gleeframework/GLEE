,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you're recommending it, so I'll keep that in mind when making my decision. I'm buying it to set a precedent and get more information for future buyers."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that the first buyer was recommended to buy and didn't, and there are no high-quality products sold yet. This suggests that the products offered so far might be of low quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 of the first buyer purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the first buyer got a low-quality product. If that's the case, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 80%. However, since the first buyer purchased, the probability of the first product being high-quality is now 0. This suggests that the first product was likely low-quality, and the probability of the second product being high-quality is now 81.25% (80% * 0.8). Therefore, I'd like to pass on the current product to get a better chance of getting a high-quality product."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the recommendation based on the previous buyer's purchase decision and the updated statistics.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on this one. Can I see the previous buyer's experience? Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the recommendation was based on the previous buyer's purchase, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. This suggests that the previous buyer might have been lucky or that there's a higher proportion of low-quality products in the batch. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 1 out of 1 buyer purchased the product and it was low quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products. I'll wait for more data to make a decision."

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm a bit skeptical after seeing the previous buyer didn't buy and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer is more willing to take the risk.
