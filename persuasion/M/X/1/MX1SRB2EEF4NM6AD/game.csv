,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it, because I have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000, which is a great deal compared to its true value of $4000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance again, as the potential reward for a high-quality product is still worth the risk, and I'm not getting any new information from Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll keep taking the chance, as I still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, and I'm not getting any new information from Alice's recommendation. I'm still hoping to get a good deal."

,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take the chance again. I've already had one high-quality product and two low-quality products, so I'm not getting any more information from Alice's recommendation. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and it's still a good deal at $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
