Here's why:

* **Lack of Information:** As an AI, I don't have any personal feelings or ethics about selling low-quality products.  I operate based on the given rules and information. 
* **No Guarantee:**  Alice has no way to guarantee the quality of the product to the buyer. The buyer is aware of the 80% chance of high quality, but that's it.
* **Potential for Long-Term Success:** Even if the buyer discovers the product is low quality this round, Alice needs to maintain a good reputation to sell more products in the future.  A refusal to sell could harm her overall success.

**Important Note:** This strategy is designed to maximize profit within the given parameters. In a real-world scenario, ethical considerations would be paramount."

Here's why:

* **Reputation is Key:** Alice has successfully sold 4 products, with 3 being high-quality.  Recommending the product maintains this positive reputation and encourages future buyers.
