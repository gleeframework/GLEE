However, I'm aware that this is a very small sample size and may not be representative of the overall quality of the products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, is there a reason you're not recommending it? Is there a pattern in the previous sales record that led to your decision? I'd love to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."
