It's not rational to recommend a purchase even with a high-quality product. Bob has seen three consecutive low-quality products, and the lack of a recommendation from Alice makes it reasonable for Bob to assume that this product is also likely low-quality.  Even though there's a 50% chance it's high-quality, the potential loss outweighs the potential gain for Bob."
