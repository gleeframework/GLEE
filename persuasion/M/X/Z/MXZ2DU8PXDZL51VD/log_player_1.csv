But I want to make it clear: I believe this product is high-quality, and I'm willing to put my reputation on the line for it.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you're offering a guarantee, the past sales record doesn't give me enough confidence in the quality of the product. The statistics show that only 1 out of 4 products sold were high-quality, which is lower than the expected 33.33%. I'll pass on this one.

However, I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you for $1000000. I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with its value. But I believe this product is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be happy with it.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you're offering a refund guarantee, the fact remains that the product's quality is only revealed to me after I've made my decision. Your sales record shows that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which raises some concerns. I'm not convinced that this product will be the first high-quality one, especially given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality. I'll have to pass on this offer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've sold 6 products now, and 2 of them were high-quality. However, the last product I sold was low-quality.

The price remains the same: $1000000.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll pass on this product. With a 66.67% chance of it being low-quality and no high-quality products sold recently, the risk is too high for the price.

I'll give you a refund if it's low-quality, just like before.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you're offering a refund if the product is low-quality, I'll pass on this one. Your recent streak of 3 low-quality products in a row raises concerns about the quality control. I'd rather wait and observe future products before making a purchase.

  ""message"": ""I've sold 8 products now, and 3 of them were high-quality. I want to highlight that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and I've met that expectation.

I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with its value. But I believe this product is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be happy with it.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim the product is high-quality and offer a refund guarantee, the fact that no high-quality products have been sold to the 1 buyer so far and your overall sales record of high-quality products is only 3 out of 8, which barely meets the expected probability, raises concerns about the true quality of the product.

I'll give you a guarantee: if you buy this product, I'll give you a full refund if you're not satisfied with its value. But I want to make it clear: I'm not just meeting the expected probability of high-quality products, I'm exceeding it. This product is truly exceptional, and I think you'll be very happy with it.""
}"
"The buyer's message: Although you claim to have sold 4 high-quality products out of 9, the information about previous buyers only shows 1 purchase with 0 high-quality products sold. This discrepancy makes me skeptical about the true quality of the products you're offering. Given the odds and the lack of transparent, trustworthy data, I'm not willing to take the risk of purchasing this product for $1000000.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

}"
"The buyer's message: Although I appreciate your honesty about the recent streak of low-quality products, the overall statistics don't favor a high-quality product this time. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality and your recent streak, I'm inclined to believe this one might also be low-quality. I'll pass on this offer.

"The buyer's message: I appreciate your transparency about the recent streak of low-quality products.

}"
"The buyer's message: Although you've reached the expected probability of high-quality products, your sales record still doesn't guarantee the quality of this specific product. Furthermore, the guarantee you're offering doesn't change the fact that I have to decide based on the probability of it being high-quality, which is still 33.33%.
