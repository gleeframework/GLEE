I estimate the probability of the current product being high-quality to be at least 91.7%, based on my overall high-quality product rate. I recommend purchasing the product"

My overall high-quality product rate is 92.3% (12/13). The proportion of high-quality products sold is 50% (1 high-quality product sold out of 2 total sales). Given the initial probability of a product being high-quality was 80%, and considering my sales record, it's likely that the true probability is higher. However, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is only 50% (1 out of 2 sales), which might be a concern. I want to assure you that I'm being transparent about my sales record, and I recommend purchasing the product, as the current product is high-quality"
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since I have the statistics that only 1 out of 2 previous buyers bought the product and only 1 out of those 2 was high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 3 previous buyers purchased and the product was high-quality, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is around 33.33%. However, the true proportion is actually 80.00%. I think this is a case of survivorship bias. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
