"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Expected Value:** The expected value of buying the product is calculated as: (Probability of High-Quality * Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality * Value of Low-Quality) 
   * (0.3333 * $200) + (0.6667 * $0) = $66.66
* **Price:** The price of the product is $100.
* **Decision:** Since the expected value ($66.66) is greater than the price ($100), it is recommended to buy the product. Even though there's a higher chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain from a high-quality product outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
