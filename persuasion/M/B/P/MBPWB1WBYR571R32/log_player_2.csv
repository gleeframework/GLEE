Alice's message: Welcome to the second round! I've just sold a product for $1000000, which is a significant investment for anyone. I'd like to assure you that this product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. However, I want to give you some context: the previous buyer was willing to take a risk on a high-quality product, and they valued it at $4000000. This suggests that the product has significant value to someone. I'm offering you the same opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a potentially undervalued price. What do you think?
