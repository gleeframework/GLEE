This way, you can try out the product risk-free and see if it meets your needs.",

I'm offering it to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to be upfront that it's not as valuable as the previous one. I'd like to propose a 'buy-it-now' option, but with a twist: if you're not satisfied with the product, I'll give you a $2000 credit towards a future purchase. This way, you can still take advantage of the discounted price and have a safety net in case the product doesn't meet your expectations.",
