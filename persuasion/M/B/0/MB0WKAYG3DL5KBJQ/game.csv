,,Alice,1,"Hello! This is a wonderful product that I think you'll really love. I've just started selling, so I don't have any sales history yet, but I assure you, this product is a great find. It's priced at $1000000, a real steal for its value. Would you like to take it home with you today?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'd like to see some evidence of the product's quality before making such a large investment.

Although I didn't make a sale in the previous round, I want to assure you that this product is of the highest quality. In fact, I'm willing to be transparent with you - the previous product was not of the same caliber as this one. This is a rare opportunity to get a top-notch product at the same price. Would you like to seize this chance and take it home for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the information, but I'm not comfortable buying without more data.  I'd like to see some sales history before committing to such a large purchase.",no

I understand that might raise some concerns, but I assure you that this product has its own value. I'm pricing it at $1000000, and I believe it's worth considering. Would you like to take a closer look?",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, with no previous sales and a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this price point. I'd be interested in seeing what happens with future sales, but I'll pass on this one.",no

I've had three previous products, and although none of them have sold yet, I'm confident that this one will find a good home. I want to remind you that about a third of my products are high-quality, and while this one isn't, it still has its own merits. If you're willing to take a chance, I think you might be pleasantly surprised. Would you like to buy it?",

I understand that might raise some concerns, but I want to be transparent with you - this product is not one of my high-quality ones. However, I believe it still has value, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price as my high-quality products. If you're a bargain hunter or just feeling lucky, this might be the opportunity for you. Would you like to take it?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. While I appreciate your offer, I'm going to pass on this one. Since there's no historical data to suggest a high probability of getting a good product, I'd prefer to wait and see if future products are better aligned with my needs.",no

I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a top-notch product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to take it home?",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the information, Alice.
