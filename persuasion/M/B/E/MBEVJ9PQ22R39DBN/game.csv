,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have already been presented with products and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products recommended to be bought so far are likely to be low-quality.

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 5 products were high-quality, it seems like the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,

With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 50%, but the lack of sales suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a future product with a recommendation from you."
