,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product as a first buyer, since I don't have any information to go by yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that she doesn't recommend it might increase the chances of it being low-quality, which would be a bad outcome for me. However, I'll take the chance and buy it, as I think the potential upside of getting a high-quality product is worth the risk."

high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
