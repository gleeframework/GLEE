,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take a chance, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just buy it and see what happens."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it, and the statistics that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision-making process. Was the product they bought high or low quality?
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, which is only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the fact that all products so far have been low-quality. I'm willing to take the risk of buying the second product, hoping it might be the first high-quality one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, I suspect that the products are low-quality and Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll wait for the next product and see if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will have better luck.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it, given the low probability of it being high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or low-quality, but given your previous recommendations were all 'no', it seems like you're trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product, I'm inclined to believe it's low quality. Given the current statistics, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's lack of recommendation suggests it's more likely to be low quality, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product for $0, thus not losing $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision. Can you share that with me?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high quality. Based on the statistics, I'm assuming that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the true probability of 33.33% since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm willing to take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I'm willing to take the chance."

,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality one for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that your lack of recommendation is due to the low quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers were discouraged by your recommendations, it's likely that the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm going to take a risk and wait for a more promising opportunity."
