I'll sell it to you for $10000, a small price to pay for the thrill of possibly getting a worthless item.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm not convinced by your argument. With only 1 out of 3 products sold being high-quality, I think it's still too early to make a conclusion about the quality of the products. I'd like to wait and see if more data comes in before making a decision.",no
