high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you like the product! However, I must inform you that the price of $50 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",

,,Bob,4,"Thank you for the offer, but I think I've already gotten a great deal. I'm not willing to pay $70 for a product that's already worth $200 to me. I'll pass on this one.",no
