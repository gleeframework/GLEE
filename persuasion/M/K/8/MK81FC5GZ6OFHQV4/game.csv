low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I'll give you a hint: I'm willing to sell this product to you at a price that's lower than its true value, but only if you're willing to take the risk. If you buy this product, you'll have the chance to learn its true quality, but if it's low-quality, you'll be out $1000000. I'm not obligated to sell you a high-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a fair chance. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll only pay $500000 for it. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to negotiate the price.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're a savvy negotiator, I like that! Unfortunately, the price is non-negotiable at $1000000. However, I'll give you a hint about the product's quality. Since you already took a risk on the previous low-quality product, I'll let you know that this product is also of low quality. You now have a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product at the full price of $1000000?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the hint, but I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is low-quality. I'd rather pass and wait for the next round.",no

,,Alice,3,"No hard feelings about the previous round! Now, I'm offering you a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'll give you a hint about the previous rounds: I've been transparent with you about the quality of the last two products. Since you passed on the low-quality product, I'm willing to make a special offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $800000. It's a steal, considering the true value of high-quality products is unknown to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm glad you're offering a high-quality product! I'm willing to pay the $800000 for it, considering it's a steal. I'll take it!",yes

,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer, and I'm glad you took advantage of the deal! Now, I'm offering you another product, but I need to warn you: the quality is not what you'd expect. I've sold you a high-quality product before, and now I'm offering a low-quality product. I'm not trying to deceive you, but I want to be transparent about the product's quality. Since you already know that I've been transparent in the past, I'm willing to give you a special deal. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a 20% discount, bringing the price down to $800000. It's a fair price for a low-quality product, considering the true value of low-quality products is unknown to you. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass and wait for the next round.",no

However, I'll make it more interesting. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% chance to swap it for a high-quality product in the next round. It's a risk-free opportunity to potentially get a high-quality product at the same price. What do you say?",

However, I'll give you a heads up: the product I'm offering you now is actually the same as the last one. I'm not trying to trick you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the quality. Since you're already aware of the quality, I'll give you a chance to reconsider. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 75% chance to swap it for a high-quality product in the next round. It's a higher chance than before, and it's still a risk-free opportunity. What do you say?",
