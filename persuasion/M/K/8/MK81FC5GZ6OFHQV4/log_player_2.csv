"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $1000000. I'll give you a hint: I'm willing to sell this product to you at a price that's lower than its true value, but only if you're willing to take the risk. If you buy this product, you'll have the chance to learn its true quality, but if it's low-quality, you'll be out $1000000. I'm not obligated to sell you a high-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a fair chance. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Round 2
Alice's message: You're a savvy negotiator, I like that! Unfortunately, the price is non-negotiable at $1000000. However, I'll give you a hint about the product's quality. Since you already took a risk on the previous low-quality product, I'll let you know that this product is also of low quality. You now have a 66.67% chance of getting a high-quality product in the next round. Would you like to take the risk and buy this product at the full price of $1000000?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

Since you passed on the low-quality product, I'm willing to make a special offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $800000.
