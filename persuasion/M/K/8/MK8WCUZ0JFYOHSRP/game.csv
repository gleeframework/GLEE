,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your past recommendations have been against selling to buyers, which might indicate a higher likelihood of low-quality products. However, I'll take the chance."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all previous products were low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 0. I'll assume that this is a biased sample and the true proportion of high-quality products is likely higher than 0. However, since the proportion is 0, I'm going to be cautious and pass on the product. I'd like to know the total number of products Alice has in stock and the number of products she has left after the 3 sales."
