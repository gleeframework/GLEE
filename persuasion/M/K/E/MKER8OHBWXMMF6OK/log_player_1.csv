""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this product! With a 80% chance of selling high-quality products, I'm confident that this one has a good chance of being a great value. I've sold 1 product so far, and 0 of them have been high-quality. That's a 0% success rate, which might make you wonder if I'm just trying to get rid of a bad product. But think about it this way: even if this product is low-quality, it's still a unique opportunity to get a product at a fixed price of $10000. You might be able to resell it for a profit, or use it for a specific purpose that makes it valuable to you. Take a chance and see what you think!""
