,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to see the statistics on the first few sales before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to inform my decision. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that the first buyer purchased it after your recommendation suggests that the product is more likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation. I'd like to buy the product and see if it's high quality, as the odds seem to be in my favor."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,

,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think the fact that you recommended it might be a red flag, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you recommended it, I'm worried that it might be low quality and I don't want to take the risk. I'd like to see the outcome of the previous buyers' products before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'm hoping to take advantage of the situation and get a high-quality product at the discounted price of $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I don't have any information to go on. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 80% and that you don't recommend it, but I'm hoping to get lucky."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/4), I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products (1/4), I'm not confident that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, it seems the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the 80% I was expecting. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold?

high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
