low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and there's no data to go off of. I'm not making any assumptions based on past sales records."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low probability of it being high-quality, but I'd like to take the chance."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low sales record and your recommendation, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far, and I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, which is lower than the 33.33% chance of a product being high quality?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, and the fact that you're recommending me to buy it, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as I think the probability of a high-quality product is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low quality. I'll pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I think the fact that you haven't recommended any high-quality products yet doesn't necessarily mean this one is low-quality. I'll take my chances!"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any information about the product's quality. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'm skeptical about the product's quality based on the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next buyer gets a better deal.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high quality is still 33.33%. The recommendation from Alice is not enough to convince me to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000, especially considering its value to me is only $1250000. I'd rather wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the quality of the previous 5 products you sold. Can you share that information with me? I'd like to update my probabilities before making a decision."

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely due to the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the remaining products may be more likely to be low quality. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product.
