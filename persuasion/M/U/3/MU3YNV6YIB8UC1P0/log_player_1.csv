This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Bob's pattern:** Bob has consistently declined to buy the product, even though he knows there's a chance of it being high-quality.
* **Lack of trust:** Bob likely doesn't trust the seller to be honest about the product's quality due to the repeated lack of recommendations.
* **Risk aversion:** Even if the product is high-quality, Bob is risk-averse and prefers not to gamble on the possibility of getting a low-quality product.

At this point, it's unlikely any message will convince Bob to buy, even with a high-quality product."
