,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on the fact that you don't recommend it, which suggests it might be a low-quality product. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that you don't have any information about my valuation."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like Alice has been recommending low-quality products to the previous buyers. I'm not confident in the quality of this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after Alice's recommendation, it suggests that the recommended products may be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous 4 buyers didn't buy, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product is low quality. I'll take the risk and see if I get a high-quality product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if all 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the fact that you recommended it suggests it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a worthless product."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product and see if you'll reveal the quality to me after.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given Alice's past recommendations, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you're not recommending it, which suggests there's a high chance it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at the price of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the previous sales record or something else?"
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product.
