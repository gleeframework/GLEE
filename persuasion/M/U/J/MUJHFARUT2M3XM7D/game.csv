high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,

,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that she knows I don't have any information about the product's quality yet. Given the low probability of a low-quality product (20%), I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
