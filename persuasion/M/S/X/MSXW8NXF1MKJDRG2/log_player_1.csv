"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is low-quality. Since you don't know how much a low-quality product is worth to Bob, and the price is fixed at $1,000,000, it's highly unlikely that Bob would find the product worth purchasing.  Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend Bob buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but based on the information provided, I am choosing not to purchase this product.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round, you know the product is high-quality. Since the price is fixed and you don't know how much Bob values a high-quality product, there's a chance he might find it worth purchasing. In this case, it's reasonable to recommend buying the product to maximize your chance of a sale.  

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. It's possible that even a high-quality product might not be worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and you might lose the sale. However, it's the best decision you can make given the limited information you have."
"Bob's message: Based on Alice's recommendation, I am willing to take the risk and purchase this product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob purchased the previous high-quality product, it suggests that he might be willing to buy more high-quality products at this price point. Even though you don't know exactly how much he values them, it's reasonable to continue recommending high-quality products for now. This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential interest in high-quality goods."

Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob bought the last two high-quality products, it's still a risky proposition to recommend a low-quality product at this price point.  We don't know how much Bob values low-quality products, and there's a high chance he won't see it as worth the $1,000,000 price tag.  

It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend this product.  We can continue to assess Bob's preferences and adjust our strategy as more rounds progress."
