"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer has no information:** The buyer has no information about this specific product other than the general 33.33% chance of it being high-quality.
* **High risk, no incentive:**  There's a much higher chance (66.67%) that the product is low-quality, and the buyer doesn't know its value.  There's no incentive to risk $1,000,000 on a potentially worthless product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  While I appreciate the information, I'm going to pass on this product. I'd prefer to see some sales history before making a purchase.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No sales history:**  The buyer explicitly stated they want to see sales history before buying.  Since this is the second round, there's no history to show.
* **High price, unknown value:** Even though the product is high-quality, the buyer doesn't know its worth.  The $1,000,000 price tag is a significant risk without any assurance of return on investment."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice.  Since there is no prior data and your recommendation is to pass, I will pass as well.  I would like to see how the next few products turn out before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent buyer behavior:**  The buyer has now shown a pattern of wanting to see sales history before committing.
* **No sales yet:** Despite having two high-quality products in a row, there are still no sales to show.
* **High risk, no information:** The buyer still has no information about the product's value and the price remains high. It's too risky to recommend a purchase without any data."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the information, but I'm going to pass on this one.  Since there's no track record yet, I'd rather wait and see if any other buyers purchase and what the quality turns out to be.  I'll reconsider if the sales history shows a higher proportion of high-quality products.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Buyer's consistent pattern:**  The buyer has been clear in their desire for a sales history before committing. They are looking for evidence of a higher proportion of high-quality products.
* **No sales, low-quality product:**  There are still no sales, and this product is low-quality.  Recommending this would further solidify a negative sales history, making it even less likely future buyers will purchase. 
* **High risk, no incentive:**  The buyer doesn't know the value of the low-quality product and the price is still $1,000,000.  There is no incentive to take that risk."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice.  While I understand there's no data yet, the odds are significantly against me getting a high-quality product.  I'll pass for now and see how things play out.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
