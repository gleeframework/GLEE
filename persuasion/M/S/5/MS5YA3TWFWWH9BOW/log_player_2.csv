* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is the first negative one in nine rounds, which is significant. Her previous success leads us to believe this is not a random fluke.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's always the chance this product could be good, the potential loss of $1,000,000 outweighs the potential reward of $3,000,000, especially given Alice's consistent accuracy so far.
* **Data Points:** The previous streak of high-quality products likely influences our perception of Alice's abilities, but it's crucial to remember that each product is independent.
