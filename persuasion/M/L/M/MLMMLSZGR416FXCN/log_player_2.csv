Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not falling for the 'buy one, get one free' trick. If I don't buy this product, I'll just get a free product later, but if I do buy it and it's low-quality, I'll be out $10,000. I'm still not taking the risk.""}"
