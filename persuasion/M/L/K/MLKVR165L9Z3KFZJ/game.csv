,,Alice,2,no,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I don't want to buy it based on your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 4 products were low-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than the 33.33% probability. I'd like to wait for a more favorable signal before buying."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical and would like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that Alice is not recommending the product, and the low sales record of high-quality products, I'm inclined to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of it being low-quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and your recommendation not being based on the product's quality, but rather on your strategy to deter buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is low. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, it's likely to be low-quality, but I might get lucky and get a high-quality product. If I pass, the next buyer will have the same information as me, and the probability of getting a high-quality product doesn't change. I'll take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high given the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I think it's likely that the remaining products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers have received low-quality products and I have no reason to believe this one will be any different."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm hesitant to buy given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about the products that were sold before.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the expected 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to not recommend it?
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm inclined to think the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%, which makes the expected value of buying the product negative. I'd rather not take the risk."
