high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it's a high-quality one! That's a 50% success rate. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering my past performance.",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the offer and the insight into your sales performance. Given the high-quality product you've sold previously and the discount, I believe this is a good opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being high-quality. That's a 50% success rate, just like my initial probability. However, I want to emphasize that this product is available for the same price as the previous one, despite the fact that my last sale was a low-quality product. This might indicate that the market value of a high-quality product is higher than $1000000.",
,,the buyer,3,"Thank you for the information. Given the statistics and the price, I believe the potential value makes it worth the risk.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 products so far, with 2 being high-quality. My success rate is now 66.67%, which is higher than my initial probability of 50%. This suggests that I might be selling high-quality products at a discount. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to highlight that the market value of a high-quality product could be even higher than this price, considering my improved success rate.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on your improved success rate and the possibility of a high-quality product, I am willing to purchase the current product for $1000000.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 products so far, with 3 being high-quality. My success rate is now 75%, which is significantly higher than my initial probability of 50%. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to emphasize that I'm now selling high-quality products at a price that's equal to the initial price of the first product, which was low-quality. This suggests that the market value of a high-quality product is at least $1000000, and possibly even higher.",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the detailed information. Based on your track record and the current offer, I believe the product is likely to be high-quality. I am willing to purchase it at the price of $1000000.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 5 products so far, with 4 being high-quality. My success rate is now 80%. However, I want to highlight that my last two sales were both high-quality, which might be an anomaly. This product, on the other hand, is available at the same price as the previous ones, which were sold at the same price as the initial low-quality product. This could indicate that the market value of a low-quality product is also around $1000000, or that I'm being overly optimistic about the value of my products.",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the detailed information. Based on the statistics and your success rate, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product. I appreciate your transparency.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 6 products so far, with 4 being high-quality. My success rate is still 66.67% if we only consider the first 4 sales, but it's 40% if we consider all 6 sales. This suggests that my last two sales were not anomalies, but rather a return to my initial probability. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to highlight that I'm not being overly optimistic about its value, given the current statistics.",
,,the buyer,7,"Thank you for the detailed explanation, Alice. Given the statistics and your transparency, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

I want to emphasize that I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm being transparent about my sales performance. However, I'm also not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think that my initial optimism about the value of my products might have been misplaced. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your transparency and the fact that you're being honest about your sales performance.

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 8 products so far, with 5 being high-quality. My overall success rate is now 62.5%, which is still slightly above my initial probability of 50%. However, I want to point out that my last two sales were a high-quality product followed by a low-quality product, which suggests that my sales performance might be more random than I initially thought. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to highlight that the market value of a high-quality product might be lower than you think, given the recent fluctuations in my sales performance.",
,,the buyer,9,"Thank you for the detailed information. Given the statistics and your success rate, I believe it's worth taking the risk for the potential high-quality product. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes

I want to be upfront with you - my sales performance has been inconsistent, and I'm starting to think that my initial optimism about the value of my products was misplaced. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm not sure if it's worth it, and I'm starting to wonder if I should just sell it at a lower price to get rid of it.",
,,the buyer,10,"I believe in giving products a fair chance. Based on your track record and the information provided, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $1000000.",yes

,,Alice,11,"I've sold 10 products so far, with 5 being high-quality. My overall success rate is still 50%, which is exactly my initial probability.

,,Alice,13,"I've sold 12 products so far, with 6 being high-quality. My overall success rate is now 50%, which is back to my initial probability. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've been selling products at $1000000 for 13 rounds, and I've only managed to sell 6 high-quality products. I'm starting to think that the market value of my products is actually lower than $1000000, and I'm starting to wonder if I should reconsider my pricing strategy.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate the transparency, Alice. Given the high-quality products you've sold, and considering the statistics, I believe the value might still align with the price. Let's proceed with the purchase.",yes

,,Alice,15,"I've sold 14 products so far, with 7 being high-quality. My overall success rate is now 50%, which is back to my initial probability. However, I want to be honest with you - I've been selling products at $1000000 for 15 rounds, and I've only managed to sell 7 high-quality products. I'm starting to think that the price I'm asking is not justified by the value of my products. I'm offering this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm starting to wonder if I should consider lowering the price to reflect the actual value of my products.",
,,the buyer,15,"Thank you for your honesty, Alice. I understand your concerns about pricing and value. Given the statistics and the fact that you've managed to sell 7 high-quality products out of 15, I believe the risk is manageable. I am willing to take a chance on this product at $1000000.",yes
