**Reasoning:**

* **High Sale Rate:** 100% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. This is a very strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of the current product being high-quality.
* **Potential Value:** Even if the product were low-quality, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($125) outweighs the potential loss ($0).

Based on these factors, it makes sense to buy the product."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record is perfect:**  All products sold so far have been high quality. This suggests Alice is likely recommending only high-quality products.
* **The potential gain is significant:** Even if there's a chance the product is low-quality, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100. 

It's important to note that this decision is based on the limited information available. A more cautious approach would be to gather more data on Alice's recommendations before making a decision."
