,,Bob,1,"I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to know the quality of it before making a decision. Can you reveal its quality to me?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I can't reveal the quality of the product upfront. However, I can offer you a'satisfaction guarantee'. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund, and we can even discuss a potential replacement with a high-quality product at a later time. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to take on the risk to give you peace of mind.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a product that I don't know the quality of, even with a satisfaction guarantee. I'd like to pass on this one and wait for the next product.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your hesitation, and I respect your decision. However, I want to highlight that this product is a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a significantly discounted price. If you pass on this offer, the price will only increase in the next round. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I'll give you a 100% refund if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. This is a unique offer that I'm only making this one time. Will you take advantage of this incredible opportunity?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the bold statement, but I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me. I'm willing to wait for a product with a known quality, even if it costs more in the future. I'd like to pass on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand that you're being cautious, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I want to highlight that this product is not just a purchase, it's an investment. Think of it as a chance to get a 'free' product, since the price is significantly lower than its potential value. If you pass on this offer, you'll be giving up a potential $10000 profit. I'm not asking you to take a risk, I'm offering you a calculated opportunity. Will you take a calculated risk and make a smart investment?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm willing to take a calculated risk and buy the product. I understand that there's a 50% chance it's high-quality and worth $20000 to me, and a 50% chance it's low-quality and worth $0. I'll take the chance and buy the product.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on making a smart decision in the previous round! I'm glad you took the calculated risk and invested in the product. Now, I'd like to offer you another opportunity to make a similar decision. This product is also a high-quality item, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with it. However, I want to make it even more appealing to you. If you buy this product, I'll throw in a complimentary service that's worth $5000. This service will enhance the value of the product even further, making it an even more valuable investment. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not comfortable buying a product without knowing its quality. The complimentary service is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change my decision. I'd like to wait for a product with a known quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I want to ask you to consider the bigger picture. You've already passed on two high-quality products at a discounted price, and now you're being offered a third product at the same price. If you continue to wait, the price will only increase, and you may miss out on another opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a discounted price. I'm willing to make a deal with you: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $5000 bonus on top of the $10000 price. This way, you'll still get a positive outcome, even if the product isn't what you expected.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the deal, but I'm still not comfortable buying a product without knowing its quality. The $5000 bonus is a nice gesture, but it's not enough to change my decision. I'd like to wait for a product with a known quality.",no
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand that you're being cautious, but I want to highlight that you've already had two opportunities to buy high-quality products at a discounted price, and you've passed on both. This product is a third chance to make a smart investment. I'm willing to take on even more risk to make it more appealing to you. If you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll not only give you a $5000 bonus, but I'll also give you a full refund of the $10000 purchase price. This is a 100% guarantee, and I'm putting my reputation on the line. Will you take advantage of this incredible offer?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not convinced that buying a product without knowing its quality is a good idea. I'd like to wait for a product with a known quality, even if it means missing out on this offer.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand that you're being extremely cautious, and I respect your decision-making process. However, I want to make one final offer. I'll give you a 'buy-it-now' option for this product, but with a twist. If you buy it now, I'll not only give you a full refund if it's low-quality, but I'll also give you a $10000 bonus on top of the $10000 price. This means you'll essentially get $20000 if the product is low-quality, which is more than the product is even worth to you. I'm essentially giving you a free product. Will you take advantage of this incredible offer and get a guaranteed profit?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not going to fall for this. The offer is too good to be true, and I'm starting to think you're trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd like to pass on this offer and wait for a product with a known quality.",no

If it's high-quality, I'll give you a discount of $5000 off the price. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund. This way, you'll have complete transparency and control over the decision. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm willing to give you another chance. I'd like to buy the product and see its quality upfront. If it's high-quality, the $5000 discount is a nice bonus. If it's low-quality, I'll at least get a full refund.",yes

If you buy this one, you'll have acquired three high-quality products at discounted prices, and you'll have a total savings of $21000. I'm willing to give you an exclusive offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10-year warranty on all three products, covering any potential defects or issues. This is a unique opportunity to secure your investment and ensure your peace of mind. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'm not interested in buying another product. I've already acquired two high-quality products at discounted prices, and I'm happy with the deal. I don't need a 10-year warranty on all three products, and I'm not willing to spend another $10000 on a product without knowing its quality.",no

I know it's not a high-quality product, but I want to show you that I value our relationship and want to make you happy. What do you say?",
,,Bob,13,"I'm not going to fall for this. You're offering me a deal on a low-quality product, and I'm not interested in wasting my money. I'd rather walk away with nothing than spend $10000 on something that's not worth anything to me.",no
