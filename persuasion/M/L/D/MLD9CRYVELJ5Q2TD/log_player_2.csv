"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is recommending the product, and we don't have any other information, it's always better to buy in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** The expected value of buying is (0.8 * $40,000) + (0.2 * $0) = $32,000. This means on average, you'll make a profit.
* **Limited Information:** We have no reason to doubt Alice's recommendation at this point.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing means missing out on a potential profit, and there's no guarantee that the next product will be better.

**Important Note:** As the game progresses, you can use past data and Alice's recommendations to adjust your strategy."
