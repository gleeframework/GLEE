low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend it, and 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of low-quality, I'll pass on it to avoid the loss."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far might indicate a higher proportion of low-quality products in the remaining pool.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have also purchased the product and none of them have received a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 33.33%.

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not going to buy it. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to pass and let the next buyer decide."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics, and I think the probability of it being high-quality is still relatively high. I'd like to take the chance."
