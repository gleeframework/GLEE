**Explanation:**

* **The Odds:** The information provided suggests that there is a good chance this product is high-quality. Although the overall probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, Alice's recommendation adds a significant signal.
* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is likely to recommend a purchase if she believes it will lead to a sale. This is because Alice has a fixed price and wants to sell the product.
* **Limited Information:** While the previous buyer's purchase doesn't guarantee this product is high-quality, it's a positive sign. 

**Reasoning:** Since the potential reward ($40,000) is significantly higher than the cost ($10,000), and Alice's recommendation adds weight, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
