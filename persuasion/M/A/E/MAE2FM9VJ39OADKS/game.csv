,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information to go on yet. I'm essentially making a blind bet. I'm hoping that the product is high quality, but I'm aware that the probability is 80% in my favor."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics, please."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product and get more information about the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is low (1/1=100%) and it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and why you don't recommend it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,"I previously recommended not buying the product because the proportion of high-quality products sold was 50%, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). However, this product is low-quality, so it's not a great investment even at $1000000."
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. Your recommendation doesn't change my decision, but I'd like to know the reason behind it."

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by your previous recommendations, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the previous sales record, only 1 out of 3 products sold was high-quality, which is a lower proportion than the 80% chance of a high-quality product. Given the low-quality product has a 20% chance, I'm not confident in the recommendation, and I'd like to pass."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product and see the recommendation for the next buyer. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards encouraging me to buy, given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers who received her recommendations bought the products. I'd like to see if the next buyer receives a similar recommendation, which would indicate a potential bias in Alice's recommendations."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I don't think Alice's recommendation is based on the product quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the 4th buyer. I'm going to take the chance and buy the product."
