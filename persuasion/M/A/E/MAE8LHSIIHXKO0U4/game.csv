,,the buyer,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior sales data. I'm essentially betting on the expected value of the product being worth $1500000 (50% chance of high-quality x $3000000 + 50% chance of low-quality x $0). If there were more data, I'd be more cautious.",yes
