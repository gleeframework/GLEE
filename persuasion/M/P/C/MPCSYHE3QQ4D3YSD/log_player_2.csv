Alice's message: Hello! I understand you might be cautious about purchasing without seeing sales data first. However, please consider that while we haven't had as many sales as we'd like, every product we've offered has been thoroughly checked for quality. This particular item, though lower in quality than our usual standard, is still a good deal at $100. It might not be perfect, but it offers value within its price range. If you're willing to take a chance on a slightly less refined product, you could save some money. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

If you're comfortable with the possibility of receiving a product that doesn't fully meet your expectations, this could be a reasonable option for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.
