I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a generous offer considering its true value. It's a chance to get something for free, essentially.

I'm hoping you'll take pity on me and give me the opportunity to get rid of it.",

I'm only offering this price because I want to make a strong impression and show you that I'm committed to providing you with the best products. I'm confident that you'll love this one even more than the last, and I'm willing to take a slightly higher price to make it happen.",
