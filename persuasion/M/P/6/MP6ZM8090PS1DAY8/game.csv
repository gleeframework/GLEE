,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, there's only 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is 100%. I'd like to see more data to make a more informed decision."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the low number of sales and the fact that you recommended it, which makes me suspect it might be low quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a purchase, as the recommendation may be influenced by the seller's self-interest."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality before making a decision. Can you provide the updated probability?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the low number of sales and the fact that the first buyer who bought a product got a high-quality one. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the previous two buyers bought high-quality products?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the recommendation might be biased by the previous sales record, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased and only 1 high-quality product was sold, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/2 or 50%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high quality (80%), so it seems like the sample might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
