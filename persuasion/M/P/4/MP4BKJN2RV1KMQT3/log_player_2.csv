Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'm glad I made a good decision on the first one. I'll take a chance on the second product, hoping it's another high-quality one.

Round 4
Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I respect your decision.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I understand your point about the opportunity cost, but I'm still not willing to take the risk.
