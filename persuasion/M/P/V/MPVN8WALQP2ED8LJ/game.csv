high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm starting to suspect that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,4,,

,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not going to buy the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she has a reason to recommend a product that hasn't been sold yet, even if it's low quality. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer will buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she has an incentive to recommend low-quality products to increase the chances of selling more products overall, but I'm still skeptical."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'm the 4th buyer, and there have been no high-quality products sold yet. The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy it, since you've recommended against it, I'm assuming there's a higher chance it's low quality"

,,Alice,14,yes,

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 6 buyers have passed on the products despite your recommendations, I'm inclined to think that there might be a higher proportion of low-quality products than I initially thought. I'd like to pass on this one."
