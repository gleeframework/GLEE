low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I have no information to go on, and I'm willing to take a chance on the first product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that the first buyer also passed after Alice's recommendation suggests that the recommendation may not be reliable. I'd like to wait and see what happens with the next buyer to get a better sense of the product's quality.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate. I'm not relying on her advice, but I'm curious to know the true quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 3 products were low-quality. I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't provide any new information. With 2 failed attempts and no high-quality products sold, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is still around 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 2 buyers also bought the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality might be lower than the overall 33.33% chance. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer gets a high-quality product, which would increase the proportion of high-quality products sold."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I've seen that all previous recommendations have led to low-quality products being purchased, and I don't want to be the third buyer to fall for it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about its quality and I'm not influenced by your previous recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's lack of recommendation is a strong indication that the product is likely low-quality. I'm hoping to exploit this information asymmetry."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making my decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%, and my personal valuation of $125 for a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. The fact that 6 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product suggests that the product is likely low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers who received a recommendation to buy the product from you did not buy a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is low. Given the probability of the product being high quality is 33.33%, I will pass on the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk based on the low sales record and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about its quality and I'm curious to see what Alice recommended to the previous 8 buyers. I'm making an uninformed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to ask, what's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all products sold so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
