high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product was low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 50/50 chance of a product being high quality, I'm skeptical of Alice's recommendation and would like to pass on the product to see if the next buyer has a better experience."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on Alice's recommendation. I'd like to know the statistics of the first buyer's experience before making a decision.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is neutral, and I'm trying to beat the odds. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth the $1000000 price tag.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Since 2 buyers have already passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the products Alice is offering might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to determine the true quality of the product and the accuracy of your recommendations."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm suspicious that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the true quality of the product and see if I can get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product. Can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending the product?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she's trying to sell me a product, and she doesn't know the true value to me. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product is low enough to make it a good bet."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, but I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the previous 6 sales, and the total number of products sold so far."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's possible that all previous buyers were offered low-quality products, which would imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'd rather wait and see if the pattern continues."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
