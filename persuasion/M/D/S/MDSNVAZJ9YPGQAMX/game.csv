,,the buyer,3,I'd like to know more about the previous product that was sold. Was it a high-quality product or a low-quality product?,no

Could you share the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your thoroughness in assessing the situation. To date, out of three products offered, none have been high-quality. However, each product still has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. Are you willing to take the risk, considering the current statistics?",

,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 7 products were all low-quality.

I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation. While the last seven products were indeed low-quality, each subsequent product still has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality. I encourage you to consider the odds and your willingness to take the risk. Would you like to proceed with this information?",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your encouragement, Alice, but I'm not convinced that the odds are in my favor.
