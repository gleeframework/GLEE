"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is low-quality. Since you don't know how much Bob values a low-quality product, it's not a good idea to recommend buying it.  There's a significant risk that Bob will find the product worth less than the $1,000,000 price, leading to a bad experience for him. It's better to avoid recommending the purchase and potentially building trust for future interactions."

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice still doesn't know how much Bob values low-quality products.  Since Bob already declined a low-quality product in the previous round, there's no reason to believe he'll value this one differently.  It's better to continue avoiding recommendations for low-quality products until more information is available."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Continuing to recommend low-quality products will only further damage the potential for a successful transaction.  Alice should focus on building trust by offering high-quality products or seeking information on Bob's valuation of low-quality products."
"Bob's message: I'm not falling for it, thanks!
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Alice's chance to turn the situation around. Bob has consistently rejected low-quality products, demonstrating a clear preference for quality. Since Alice now has a high-quality product, it's a good idea to recommend it. 

Here's why:

* **Trust:** Even though Bob has been cautious, a high-quality product offer could show that Alice is trying to be fair. 
* **Potential for a sale:**  There's a good chance Bob will value the high-quality product highly enough to make the purchase, especially after a series of low-quality offers.

This is a gamble, but it's a calculated one with a potential payoff."
