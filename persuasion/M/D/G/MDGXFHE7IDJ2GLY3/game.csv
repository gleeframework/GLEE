,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. It's a great deal! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm not sure what you think, but I'm hoping you'll take a chance on it. If you don't like it, I have plenty more where this came from.",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your hesitation earlier, but I want to assure you that this product is one of the good ones. I've had great feedback from other customers who have purchased similar items. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a fixed price of $100. If you're still unsure, I can offer a small guarantee: if you buy this product and you're not satisfied, I'll give you a refund, but I think you'll find it's worth much more than that.",

I'll give you a small incentive to take the risk: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a $50 store credit towards your next purchase. I think this is a fair deal, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling a low-quality product at a fixed price of $100.",

Given your experience with the previous product, I think you'll find this one to be even more valuable. I'm willing to make a bold statement: I think this product is worth at least $150 to you, but I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $100. It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount, and I think you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",

This product is one of the best I have, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. If you buy this product and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you a $20 bonus on top of the $100 price.

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is also low-quality. However, I want to make it worth your while to take a chance on it. I'll give you a $30 store credit if you buy this product, on top of the $100 price.
