"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice knows the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of it being high-quality, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000

This is greater than the price of $1,000,000. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in this round."

```

(0.5 * $1,200,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $600,000

However, this is still less than the price of $1,000,000. Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product in this round."
