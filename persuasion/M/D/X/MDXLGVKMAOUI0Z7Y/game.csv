,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since there's no data to go on and your recommendation doesn't sway me one way or the other."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice has already recommended against it. I'm hoping that the low quality products are more likely to be recommended against, and I'm taking a chance that the product is high quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

,,Alice,8,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on previous sales data. The fact that 2 out of 2 previous products were low-quality suggests that the products might be biased towards low quality. I'd like to pass on this one for now.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the probability of the product being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that all previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to understand your thought process and see if I can make a more informed decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous three products were high-quality, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be lower than 50%. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on her knowledge of the product's value to me, and she has a vested interest in selling me a low-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, Alice. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a product that has a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $1000000 on a low-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
