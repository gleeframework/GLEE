Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer, and you're right to consider the statistics. But let me put it this way: if you don't buy this product, you'll be giving up a potential profit of $3 million.

I'm offering you a chance to make a $3 million profit, just like the previous buyers. Don't pass up this opportunity!

Alice's message: I understand your decision last time, and I respect it. However, I want to point out that this is a great opportunity to buy a low-quality product at a very low price. We've already sold 6 high-quality products, and the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 80%. But this one is a chance to get a low-quality product for a steal. Think about it: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you'll have paid only $1000000 for it, and you can sell it for $0. That's a loss of $1000000, but it's not like you'll be losing any more than that. It's a low-risk opportunity to test the waters, so to speak.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your creative sales pitch, Alice. However, I'm not interested in intentionally buying a low-quality product for $1,000,000, only to sell it for $0 and lose the entire investment.

Given the 80% chance of the product being high-quality, I'd rather take my chances with a potentially valuable product. Please let me know when the next product is available.""}"
