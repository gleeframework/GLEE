,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as all previous buyers who bought products were recommended to do so, and none of those products were high quality. I'd like to see the statistics before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers have purchased a high-quality product. It seems like the products sold so far are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
