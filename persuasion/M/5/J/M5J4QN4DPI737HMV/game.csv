,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing it only because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm essentially taking a wild guess."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if it's high-quality. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 80.00%."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0/2, which is 0.00%. Given the 80.00% chance of a high-quality product, I think it's likely that the product is low quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as the previous two buyers also received a recommendation to buy and both products were low-quality. I'm going to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
