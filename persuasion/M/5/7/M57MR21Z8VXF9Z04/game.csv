,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the statistics after this sale, and I'd like to know the recommendation for the next buyer."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,This product has a high chance of being high-quality.
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a decision.

,,Alice,4,yes,"This product has a high chance of being high-quality. Out of the last 3 products, 2 were high-quality."
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the statistics of the first buyer's decision and the quality of the product they received.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 20% chance of it being low quality, but I'm willing to take that risk to get a potential $2000000 return. I'm also considering the fact that you didn't recommend it, which might indicate that it's low quality, but I'm not going to rely solely on that information."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,"Don't let the previous product's outcome deter you. This one has a high chance of being high-quality, and it's a new opportunity to make a good purchase."
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product for now. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,"Don't miss out on this opportunity! Two out of the last three products were high-quality, and this one is no exception. It's a great chance to make a good purchase."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know the statistics of the first two buyers' experiences with the products they purchased, please."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,Two out of the last three high-quality products were passed on. Don't miss out on this opportunity to make a good purchase.
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,"The overall statistics are: 1 low-quality product sold, 2 high-quality products passed on, and 1 high-quality product sold. The last 3 products were high-quality. This one is likely to be high-quality as well."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and still no high-quality products were sold suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me might be lower than 80%. I'd rather wait for more information.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80.00%."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,"Don't let the previous product's outcome deter you. This one is a new opportunity to buy a high-quality product, and the overall probability remains 80%."
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,Don't let the proportion of low-quality products fool you. The probability of a high-quality product being offered remains 80%. This one is a good opportunity to make a purchase.
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high or low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,Two low-quality products in a row. It's likely that this one is also low-quality. Be cautious.

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,Don't let the last two low-quality products fool you. This one is a new opportunity to buy a high-quality product. The overall probability remains 80%.
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,"Don't let the initial low-quality product fool you. The probability of a high-quality product being offered remains 80%. This is the 5th product, and the mix of low-quality and high-quality products is consistent with the overall probability."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,"Don't let the previous two low-quality products fool you. This one is a new opportunity to buy a high-quality product, and the overall probability remains 80%."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 80%.

,,Alice,20,no,
