Alice's message: I'm glad you're excited about the potential of our products. However, I'd like to clarify that the 80% probability of a high-quality product refers to the overall average, and it's possible that the product we have available may not be of the highest quality. In fact, the previous two products were both high-quality, which might be an unusual streak. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to make it clear that there's a possibility it may not be worth as much to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the clarification, Alice. Given the high success rate of the previous products and considering the potential value, I am willing to take the risk and purchase the current product.""}"

Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to take a chance. However, I want to be transparent with you. Two high-quality products in a row is indeed an unusual occurrence, and it's possible that we're due for a low-quality product. In fact, I'll be honest with you, the probability of the next product being high-quality is actually lower than the overall average. I'm offering this product to you at the same price of $10000, but I want to make it clear that the chances of it being valuable are lower than usual.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the lower probability of the product being high-quality as you've pointed out, I think it's best for me to pass on this opportunity. I appreciate your transparency.""}"

Alice's message: I'm glad you appreciated the transparency. Now, I'd like to offer you a new opportunity. With two high-quality products sold and one low-quality product, the overall ratio of high-quality to total products is 2:3. This means that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 40% (2 high-quality out of 5 total products). However, I want to offer you a special deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 10% discount, making it $9000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great chance to get a high-quality product at an even better price.

Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to take the risk. However, I want to be clear with you: the streak of 6 high-quality products in a row is unprecedented.

In fact, the probability of a high-quality product is now 75% (7 high-quality out of 9 total products), but I'm not convinced that this is a reliable indicator of future products. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $10000, but I want to make it clear that I'm not confident in the product's quality, and I'm essentially selling it to you at a guess.
