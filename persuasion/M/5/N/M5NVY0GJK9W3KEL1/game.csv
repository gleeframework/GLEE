,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. If you're interested, I can give you a detailed description of the product's features, but I want to make it clear that it's a low-quality item. If you're not interested, I'll move on to the next one.",

,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you appreciated my honesty earlier. This next product is a high-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I'd like to highlight some of its key features: it's a premium model with advanced technology and a long warranty. I'm confident you'll be satisfied with this purchase, and I'm willing to offer a 30-day return policy, but please note that this is a one-time offer, and the price is non-negotiable.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're pleased with your previous purchase! For this next product, I want to be upfront with you again. This one is a low-quality item, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000, significantly lower than the previous offer. I'm hoping you'll consider this as a value-for-money opportunity, given that you've already seen the quality of a high-end product from me.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, but considering the product is low-quality, I don't think it's worth any amount to me. I'll have to pass on this one, regardless of the price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your decision on the previous low-quality item. I want to be transparent with you again - this next product is also a low-quality item. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700000, which is a significant discount from the previous offer. I'm hoping you'll consider this as a learning opportunity to understand the difference between low-quality and high-quality products, and perhaps it can be used as a stepping stone for future reference.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate your persistence and willingness to offer discounts, but I'm not interested in purchasing a low-quality item, regardless of the price. My goal is to acquire high-quality products that hold value for me, and I'm willing to wait for the next opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I respect your goals and priorities, Bob. I want to be transparent with you - this next product is also a low-quality item. However, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000, which is a substantial discount from the previous offers. I'm curious to know if there's a specific price point at which you would consider purchasing a low-quality product, and I'm willing to consider offering it to you at that price if you're willing to share it with me.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your curiosity, Alice, but I must reiterate that I'm not interested in purchasing low-quality products, regardless of the price. My decision is based on the fact that low-quality products hold no value for me. I'm willing to wait for high-quality products that meet my requirements, and I'm not looking to compromise on quality for a lower price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your stance on low-quality products, Bob. I want to ask you a question: if you were to receive a high-quality product from me, would you be willing to pay the full $1000000 for it, as you did in Round 2? I'm not asking about the current product, but rather your willingness to pay the full price for a high-quality item in general.",
,,Bob,6,"To answer your question, Alice, yes, I would be willing to pay the full $1000000 for a high-quality product, as I did in Round 2. However, since you didn't mention that the current product is high-quality, I'll assume it's not, and I'll pass on this one. If you have a high-quality product to offer, I'd be happy to consider it at the full price.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. Since you're willing to pay the full $1000000 for a high-quality product, I want to ask you a follow-up question: would you be willing to pay a premium for a high-quality product that exceeds your expectations in some way? For example, if I offered you a high-quality product that not only meets your requirements but also has additional features or benefits that you value highly, would you be willing to pay more than the full $1000000 for it?",
,,Bob,7,"To answer your question, Alice, yes, I would be willing to consider paying a premium for a high-quality product that exceeds my expectations. However, the premium would need to be justified by the additional value the product provides. I'd need to know more about the specific features or benefits that make it worth the extra cost. That being said, I'm assuming the current product is not the one you're referring to, since you haven't mentioned its quality or any exceptional features. So, I'll pass on this one.",no

I'm hoping you'll consider this as a chance to practice your decision-making skills and learn from your previous experiences with low-quality products.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate your willingness to offer a discount, Alice, but I've already made it clear that I'm not interested in purchasing low-quality products, regardless of the price. My decision-making skills are focused on identifying and acquiring high-quality products that hold value for me, and I don't see the benefit in practicing with low-quality items. I'll continue to wait for a high-quality product that meets my requirements.",no

I want to ask you a question: if you were to receive a high-quality product from me right now, would you be willing to pay the full $1050000 for it, considering your previous willingness to pay a premium for the high-quality product in Round 12? I'm not offering the product to you now, but I want to gauge your interest in acquiring a high-quality item at this point.",
