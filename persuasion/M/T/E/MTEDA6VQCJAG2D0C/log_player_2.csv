Alice's message: I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1, but I've just received a new shipment and this one is definitely high-quality. Would you like to buy this product for $10000?

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No previous data:**  There is no previous sales record to rely on. 
* **Alice's confidence:**  Alice claims the product is ""definitely high-quality"". While we can't be certain, this statement gives us a reason to be more optimistic than the standard 50% probability.
* **Potential payoff:** Even if there's a chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential payoff of a high-quality product ($20,000) is significant.

**Risk vs. Reward:** Taking the risk makes sense considering the potential reward and the lack of negative information."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Previous Success Rate:** Alice's claim of selling 5 high-quality products out of 7 is a strong indicator. This represents a 71.4% success rate, significantly higher than the 50% random chance. 
* **Confidence:** Alice's expression of confidence in this particular product adds to the positive outlook. While not a guarantee, it suggests she believes this product is likely high-quality.
* **Potential Reward:** The potential reward of $20,000 is significant, outweighing the $10,000 risk.

**Note:** This decision still carries risk, as there is a chance the product could be low quality. However, the available information suggests a higher likelihood of it being high quality."
