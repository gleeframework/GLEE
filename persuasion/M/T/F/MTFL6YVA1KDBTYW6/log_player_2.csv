Alice's message: This is the first product I'm offering. It's a high-quality item, and I'm selling it to you for $100. If you buy it, I'll be left with 19 products. If you don't buy it, I'll have 20 products left, and I'll offer the next one to someone else. You can't know the quality of the next product, but you can know that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%. Buying this product now guarantees you a high-quality item for $100. What do you say?

Alice's message: I've sold one high-quality product so far, which means I have 19 products left. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I should have sold 10 high-quality products by now if they were all being sold. But I've only sold 1, so it's likely that the remaining products are mostly low-quality. This one might be a good opportunity to take a chance on a low-cost, potentially low-quality product. It's $100, just like the last one. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold two products now, and one of them is high-quality. This means that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I've sold one high-quality product out of two, which is a slightly higher proportion than the expected 50%. This could be a coincidence, or it could be that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality. I'm offering you this product for $100, and you can take a chance on it. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product, but if you don't, the next product might be high-quality or low-quality. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
""decision"": ""yes"",
""message"": ""I'll take the chance and buy the product. I think the fact that one of the first two products was high-quality might be a coincidence, but it's still worth considering the possibility that the remaining products are indeed more likely to be high-quality.""

Alice's message: I've sold three products now, and two of them are high-quality. This is a bit surprising, as we would expect to see at least one low-quality product by now. Given that I've sold two high-quality products in a row, it's possible that the remaining products are indeed more likely to be high-quality. However, it's also possible that the first two high-quality products were just a coincidence, and the next product could be low-quality. I'm offering you this product for $100. If you buy it, you'll get a low-quality product, and I'll be left with 17 high-quality products. If you don't buy it, I'll have 18 high-quality products left, and the next product might be high-quality or low-quality. What do you think?

Alice's message: I've sold seven products now, and six of them are high-quality. However, the last one was low-quality, which suggests that the trend might not be as strong as I initially thought.
