"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, but if you don't buy it, the price will go up to $120 for the next product. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""yes"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the current high-quality product. I know it's worth $200 to me, and I don't want to risk missing out on a good deal. I'll take the $100 price and hope that the next product is also high-quality and worth a discount.""

I'm also offering a 90-day money-back guarantee, so if you're not completely satisfied, you can return it for a full refund. This is a one-time offer, and the price remains at $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",

Would you like to buy the current product?","{
  ""decision"": ""no"",
