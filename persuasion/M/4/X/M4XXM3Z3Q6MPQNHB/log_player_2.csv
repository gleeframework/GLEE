Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence. Let me provide you with a more detailed breakdown of our sales record. Out of the 5 products sold so far, 4 have been high-quality. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is actually 80%. With that in mind, I'd like to reiterate that this is a rare opportunity to get your hands on a premium product at a competitive price of $100. I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? Will you take advantage of this chance?

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I respect your cautious approach. However, I'd like to highlight that our sales record is already showing a strong trend in favor of high-quality products. With 4 out of 5 products sold being high-quality, it's likely that this streak will continue. Additionally, waiting to see how many more products are sold might mean missing out on this opportunity. The price remains the same at $100, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere.
