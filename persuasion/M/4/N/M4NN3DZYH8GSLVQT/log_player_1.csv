"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Expected Value:**  Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.
    * If the product is high-quality, Bob makes a profit of $40,000 - $10,000 = $30,000
    * If the product is low-quality, Bob loses $10,000.
    * Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Profit from High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Loss from Low Quality)
    * Expected Value = (0.8 * $30,000) + (0.2 * -$10,000) = $24,000 - $2,000 = $22,000 

* **Recommendation:** Since Bob's expected value is positive ($22,000), it's in his best interest to buy the product."
