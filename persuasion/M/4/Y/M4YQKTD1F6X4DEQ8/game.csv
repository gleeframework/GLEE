,,Alice,1,"This is a unique opportunity to make a great investment! I'm offering you a product that could potentially be worth $3000000.

Will you take the chance?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to know more about your previous sales record before making a decision. Can you share some statistics with me?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you asked about my sales record. As it stands, I've sold 1 product so far, and unfortunately, it was a low-quality one. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 50%. Don't let the previous sale discourage you, though - every product has its own unique characteristics, and this one could be the one that changes your life. Would you like to take the chance and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,2,"I understand that the previous product was low-quality, but I'm willing to take a chance on this one. I'll go ahead and make a purchase.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 low-quality products so far, which means that 2 out of 2 products I've sold were not high-quality. While this doesn't necessarily mean the next product will be low-quality, it does suggest a slight bias. However, I'd like to assure you that I have many high-quality products available, and I'm confident that the next one will be a great investment. Would you like to take the chance and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your assurance, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're cautious! I understand that my sales record may not be what you'd like to see. However, I'd like to point out that I've sold 2 products in total, and now I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product. In fact, I've just received a high-quality product in this very round! This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price. Would you like to take advantage of this chance and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on the high-quality product, but I want to make sure I'm not getting ripped off. Can you give me a better price for this high-quality product?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concern, but I'm afraid the price is non-negotiable. I'm willing to offer you the product at the standard price of $1000000. However, I can offer you some context: with 2 low-quality products sold out of 3 total, the probability of the current product being high-quality is actually 0%. This is a low-risk opportunity to get a product that's guaranteed to be low-quality. Would you like to take the chance and make a purchase?",
,,the buyer,5,I'm not convinced by your argument. I'd rather pass on this opportunity and wait for a better one.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,6,,

However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and it's likely that the next product will be more representative of the overall average quality. Would you like to take the chance and make a purchase, or do you want to wait for more data to accumulate?",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to wait for more data to accumulate before making a decision. I'm not convinced that the law of large numbers is kicking in yet, and I'd rather have more information before committing to a purchase.",no
