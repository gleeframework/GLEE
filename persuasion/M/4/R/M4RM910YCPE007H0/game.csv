high-quality,12500.0,Nature,1,,,
,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, since I have no information about the product's quality.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,no,,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, since I have no information about the product's quality and Alice doesn't recommend it, I'll assume the worst and go for it.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,,
,,Alice,3,yes,,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. Can you provide more information about the previous buyer who purchased a product?",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,yes,,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 1, which is 0%. This is significantly lower than the actual probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I suspect that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 purchase, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality and not worth the $10000 price tag.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,,
,,Alice,6,yes,,"I want to assure you that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%. The previous buyers' decisions were based on incomplete information. I recommend buying this product, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment."
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see more data on the quality of the products before making a decision.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"I want to share some statistics with you. Out of the 6 previous rounds, 5 products were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased. The only product that was purchased was low-quality. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"I want to remind you that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. By not buying this product, you might be missing out on a $12500 value for $10000. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm concerned that if I buy a low-quality product, I'll lose $10000 and there's still no guarantee of getting a high-quality product even if I buy again.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"I want to point out that my recommendation is not just about this individual product, but also about the overall value you can get from buying from me. With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, the expected value of buying from me is $10000 * 0.8 = $8000 + $2500 (20% of $12500) = $10500. This is higher than the price you pay. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation given the 0 high-quality products sold so far.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been convincing, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products. I've had a streak of high-quality products, but unfortunately, none of them have been purchased. I'm willing to stake my reputation on this product being high-quality. If you buy it and it's not high-quality, I'll make sure to disclose the outcome publicly, so future buyers can make informed decisions. I'm confident that this product is high-quality, and I strongly recommend buying it."
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and observe more sales data before making a decision.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,,
,,Alice,11,yes,,"I want to be transparent about the situation. I've had 10 previous rounds with high-quality products, but none of them were purchased. The only product that was purchased was low-quality. I understand that this might raise concerns, but I assure you that this product is high-quality. I'm willing to provide a detailed record of all previous rounds, including the quality of each product, to help you make an informed decision. I recommend buying this product, and I'm confident it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think it's likely to be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased a product?",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,yes,,"Regarding the previous buyer who purchased a product, I can tell you that they bought a low-quality product in Round 2. However, I want to emphasize that this was an anomaly, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Since then, I've had 10 consecutive rounds with high-quality products, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it. I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,no,,"I don't recommend buying this product. I strive to provide high-quality products, but unfortunately, this one doesn't meet my standards. I want to maintain transparency and trust with my buyers, so I advise against purchasing this product."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, can you tell me more about the product?",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,yes,,"I'm glad to have a high-quality product again. I want to assure you that this product meets my high standards, and I strongly recommend buying it. With an 80% chance of getting a high-quality product, I believe this is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product for $10000. I'm confident that you won't be disappointed."
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of quality, and the statistics show that no high-quality products have been sold so far.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,15,,,
,,Alice,15,yes,,"I understand that my previous recommendations haven't been convincing, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to selling high-quality products. I've had a streak of high-quality products, and I'm confident that this one is no exception. I want to offer a different perspective: even if you don't trust my recommendation, the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 80%. This means that the expected value of buying from me is higher than the price you pay. I recommend buying this product, and I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product given the current sales record?,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,16,,,
,,Alice,16,yes,,"I understand that the current sales record might raise concerns, but I want to assure you that the probability of a high-quality product is still 80%. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far is an anomaly, and it doesn't reflect the true quality of my products. In fact, out of the 15 previous rounds, 13 products were high-quality, but unfortunately, none of them were purchased. The only two products that were purchased were low-quality. I recommend buying this product, and I'm confident that it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"I want to emphasize that the lack of high-quality products sold so far is not a reflection of the quality of my products, but rather a result of buyers being cautious. I've had 14 high-quality products out of 16 rounds, and I'm confident that this product is also high-quality. I recommend buying this product, and I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision. I believe that this product is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product for $10000."
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision.",
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,18,,,
,,Alice,18,yes,,"I want to correct a misunderstanding. You mentioned that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, but that's not entirely accurate. While it's true that only 1 low-quality product has been sold, I've actually had 15 high-quality products out of 17 rounds. The fact that none of them were purchased doesn't change their quality. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend buying it. I'm confident that it will meet your expectations."
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the product quality before making a decision. Was the product sold to the previous buyer high or low quality?,
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,,
,,Alice,19,no,,"I want to be transparent with you. The product I'm offering in this round is low-quality. I don't recommend buying it, as it doesn't meet my standards. I strive to provide high-quality products, and I'm committed to being honest with my buyers. I advise against purchasing this product."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.,
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,20,,,
,,Alice,20,yes,,"I'm glad to have a high-quality product for this final round. I want to assure you that this product meets my high standards, and I strongly recommend buying it. Despite the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I've had a total of 17 high-quality products out of 20 rounds. I'm confident that this product is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product for $10000. I'm willing to provide any additional information you need to make an informed decision."
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1 product offered, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still 80%, but I'm not convinced by the recommendation. I'd like to wait for more data.",
