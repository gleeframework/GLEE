,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 1 high-quality product was sold out of 3 purchases, which is a 33.33% success rate. Given the 80.00% chance of a high-quality product, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards selling low-quality products.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I would like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 5, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0.2. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (0.8), suggesting that the sample may be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
