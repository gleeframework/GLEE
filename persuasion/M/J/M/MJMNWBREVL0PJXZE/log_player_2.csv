**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the data is limited, we know one high-quality product was sold.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, who has knowledge of the product's quality, recommends buying it. This is a strong signal that the product is likely high-quality. 
* **Potential Value:**  Even if the product is low-quality (66.67% chance), the worst-case scenario is that it is worth $0. However, there is a 33.33% chance it is worth $125, making it a potential good deal.

**Note:**  While the odds are still in favor of a low-quality product, Alice's recommendation drastically increases the perceived probability of the product being high-quality. This makes taking the risk a reasonable decision."
