Alice's message: I understand your skepticism. Let me put it this way: if I was selling low-quality products, I would have sold more by now. The fact that I've only sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products suggests that there's a good chance the next one is high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?

Alice's message: You're absolutely right to clarify the odds. If the first buyer got a high-quality product, that means the first product was high-quality and the second product was low-quality. In that case, the odds for the third product are 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products, which is 20%.
