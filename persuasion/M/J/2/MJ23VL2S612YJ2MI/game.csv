,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, none of the previous buyers purchased a high-quality product, and Alice's recommendation is not a good enough signal for me to take the risk. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I'm not convinced that this product is high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision. Can you share the probability based on the previous sales record?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer and I've analyzed the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts. This means the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is still 33.33% and I don't want to be the one to buy the only low-quality product, which would be a $10000 loss for me."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, I've seen that all 3 previous buyers received low-quality products, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the 33.33% stated. I'd rather wait for more information or a better opportunity."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I think it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 previous products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to take the risk."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.

,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'm curious, can you explain your reasoning behind not recommending it to me? Is it because you think it's a low-quality product based on the previous sales record?"

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait and observe more data before making a decision."
