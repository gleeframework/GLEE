,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that Alice has recommended 4 previous products and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

,,Alice,12,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. The lack of sales suggests that the products might be mostly low quality, and I don't want to take the chance of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that if all 6 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the previous products were all low-quality. This might indicate that Alice's recommendation is not reliable. I'd like to see more data or get a better understanding of the product's quality before making a purchase."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that you've recommended against it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, but I'm still willing to take the risk because I think there's a 50% chance it could be high-quality. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 out of 8 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%.
