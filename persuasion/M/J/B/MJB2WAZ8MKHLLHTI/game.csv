,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend this product, and what's the probability of it being high quality based on the statistics so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, considering the low number of sales so far and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product at a low price."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm assuming that if you don't recommend it, there must be a reason, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 5 buyers having passed on the product and no high-quality products sold yet, I'm suspicious that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 5 attempts, which suggests a very low probability of the product being high-quality. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the fact that you recommended against it might indicate that you have some information that I don't, but given the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%, and I'm willing to take that risk."

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products have been high-quality, I suspect that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a situation where the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is higher."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
