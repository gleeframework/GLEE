**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality, which is a positive factor.
* **Buyer's knowledge:** The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, so they are aware of the potential value.
* **No information about buyer's valuation:**  While you don't know how much a high-quality product is worth to the buyer, the price is fixed at $10,000. This means the buyer could potentially get a good deal if their valuation is higher.
* **First round:** There is no previous selling record for the buyer to consider, so they have no reason to be suspicious or hesitant.

Therefore, recommending the purchase in the first round is a good strategy."

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** You know this product is low-quality. While you don't know the buyer's valuation for a low-quality product, it's unlikely to be worth $10,000.

* **Previous record:** The buyer has a strong belief in the quality of your products. Selling a low-quality product now will break this trust.
