Additionally, I'll provide you with a detailed report on the product's performance and reviews from satisfied customers. I believe this additional information will alleviate any doubts you may have.

That's a 300% return on investment! I'm willing to take on the risk myself by offering you a 'buy-it-now' deal. If you're willing to take the chance, I'll give you an exclusive deal that's only available for the next 24 hours. What do you say?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, you're trying to spin the potential gain, but the potential loss is still there.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your personal guarantee is a nice gesture, but it doesn't change the underlying risk. I still have a 20% chance of getting a $0 product, and I'm not willing to pay $10,000 for that risk. I'll pass.""}"
