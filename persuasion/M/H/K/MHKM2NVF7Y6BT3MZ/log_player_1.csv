You might be wondering if the previous product was an anomaly. I'd like to reassure you that my sales record is still very much in line with the expected probability of 33.33%. In fact, I'd like to offer you a deal that takes into account the uncertainty of the previous round. I'll give you a 50% discount on this product if you buy it now. That brings the price down to $5,000. What do you say?""

However, I'd like to point out that the previous buyer's decision to buy after asking about my sales record suggests that they were influenced by the uncertainty of the previous product being low-quality. In contrast, you're getting a chance to buy a product that has been thoroughly vetted by a previous buyer who was also interested in the product's quality. I'm confident that this product is of high quality, and I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount if you buy it now. That brings the price down to $9,000. What do you say?""

However, I want to be clear that this discount is not because I'm uncertain about the product's quality. I'm offering it to you because I'm confident that you'll appreciate the value of the product, and I want to incentivize you to make a purchase. In fact, I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 8 total products, which is a 37.5% success rate. This is still within the expected range of 33.33%, and I'm not offering any additional discounts.

As for the probability of the product being high-quality given the sales record and the price you're being offered, I'd like to calculate it for you. With 4 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and 2 low-quality products sold at a discount, I'd estimate the probability of the product being high-quality to be around 25%.

However, I'd like to point out that the proportion of low-quality products sold is actually lower than expected. Out of the 8 low-quality products sold, 5 of them were sold at a discounted price, which suggests that buyers were aware of the potential risk.
