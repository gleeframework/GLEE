high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You just saw a high-quality product go for $10000, and I'm not changing the price. This one is also high-quality, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. The price remains the same at $10000. You can either take a chance or look elsewhere.",
,,the buyer,2,I'll take the chance and buy the product. I'll take the risk that it might be high-quality and worth $12500 to me.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen two high-quality products sold for $10000 each. I'm not changing the price, but I'll give you a hint: the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. If you're feeling lucky, you can take the chance and buy this one for $10000.",

,,Alice,4,"You've seen three high-quality products sold for $10000 each. I'm starting to think you're a lucky buyer! The price remains the same, but I'll give you a gentle reminder: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%. Take the chance or look elsewhere?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've seen three high-quality products sold for $10000 each, but I've also sold 3 products in total. The probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, but that means 20% of the time you'll get a low-quality product. This one might not be worth $10000 to you, but it's still a great deal at this price. Take the risk or walk away?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to take a chance on the 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, and if it's high-quality, I'll be happy to pay $10000 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've seen 4 high-quality products sold for $10000 each, but 2 of the 5 products I've sold were low-quality. I'm starting to think the price might be a bit too high for what you'll get. I'll be honest with you, the last two products I sold were not worth $10000 to the buyers. This one might be the same. Think carefully before making a decision.",
,,the buyer,6,"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, considering the statistics, 4 out of 5 products sold were high-quality, which suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still quite high. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's another high-quality one.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're right, the statistics do suggest a high probability of a high-quality product. And I'm glad I could provide you with a good experience earlier.

,,Alice,8,"You've seen 5 high-quality products sold for $10000 each, but 3 of the 8 products I've sold were low-quality. I think it's time for me to be more transparent with you. The probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 80%, but the last two products I sold were not worth $10000 to the buyers. I'm not making any promises about this one, but I'll give you a hint: it's not high-quality. The price remains the same at $10000. Think carefully before making a decision.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"No hard feelings about the last buyer passing on the deal. I'll give you a more detailed breakdown of my sales record: 5 high-quality products out of 8 total. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but it's clear that the last two products I sold were not worth the price. This one is definitely not high-quality, and I'm willing to let it go for $10000. You can get it for a steal, but you have to be willing to take the risk.",
