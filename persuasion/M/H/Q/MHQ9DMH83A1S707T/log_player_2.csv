Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I've heard this song and dance before, and I'm not falling for it.

Instead, I want to remind you of the probability of getting a high-quality product. You know that 1 in 3 products are of high quality. You've already passed up two products that I claimed were high-quality. The odds are that at least one of them was indeed high-quality. This product is another opportunity for you to take a chance.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You're trying to appeal to my rational side, but I'm still cautious. However, the odds are in my favor, and I'm willing to take a chance. I'll buy the product and see if it's the one I've been missing out on.""}"

If you're looking to capitalize on the momentum, this product is another opportunity to get a high-quality product. I'm not trying to deceive you - this one is genuinely worth the $100.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to fall for it again. I've been burned before by your 'genuine' claims, and I'm not going to take the risk of wasting another $100 on a low-quality product. I'll wait for a more convincing offer.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm glad you're being honest with me. I'm not going to fall for the 'clearing out inventory' excuse. If you're getting rid of your low-quality products, that's just a sign that they're worthless to me.""}"
