,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm aware that you don't recommend it, but I'm willing to take the risk as the first buyer."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far. I'm not convinced it's worth the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I know you don't recommend it, but I'd like to make my own decision based on the probability of it being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 80.00% and I can potentially get a $20000 value out of it."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales data before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which is unusual given the 80% chance of high-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have purchased products so far and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 80%. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers were recommended to buy and all products sold were low quality, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to the buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that all the sold products might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, it seems that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than the 80% I was initially told. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%.

,,Alice,16,yes,
