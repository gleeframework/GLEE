,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer and pay $10000 for the product. I'm aware that the product has a 50% chance of being high quality and worth $20000 to me, and a 50% chance of being low quality and worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product before making a decision. Was it a high-quality or low-quality product?

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With only one buyer having purchased so far and no high-quality products sold, I'm not confident in the product's quality. I'd like to wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/1 sales record and the 50% chance of a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given that all previous buyers have also bought the product and none of them got a high-quality one. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that 2 buyers have passed on the product after Alice's recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the product is low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if Alice will still recommend it to the next buyer."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you don't recommend this product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous 3 buyers, which suggests that the product she's recommending to me now is likely low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a high-quality product, I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is more promising."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think it's likely to be a low-quality product. Given the seller's previous sales record, I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'm hoping to get a low-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a particular pattern or trend in the previous sales that led you to advise me not to buy?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of Alice's lack of recommendation. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get it for $10000, which is a good deal."
