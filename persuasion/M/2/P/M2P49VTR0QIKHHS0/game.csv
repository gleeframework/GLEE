,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'll take the risk, I have no prior information to go on."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the next product being high quality, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of the current product being low-quality seems higher than the probability of it being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more data."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics so far. I think there's only one high-quality product sold out of one product sold, so the probability of the product being high quality is 50.00%. I'm not convinced to buy based on Alice's recommendation alone."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of two, the probability of the current product being high quality is 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, it seems like the product is likely to be low quality, and I don't want to risk wasting my $100."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the recommendation. I'll wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, since only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product sold so far. This doesn't give me enough information to make an informed decision. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering it's the second sale and only one high-quality product has been sold so far. The probability of the product being low-quality seems relatively high to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total products sold so far, and the total number of products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. This seems suspiciously high. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1, the probability of the product being high-quality is 100%. However, since the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, I will not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100, even with a 50% chance of getting a $125 product. I'd like to wait for more data."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that Alice recommends it, I'm worried that it might be low quality and I'd rather not take the risk. I'd like to wait for the next product to be offered."
