**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little information about the product.  
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. She knows the true quality and wouldn't recommend a low-quality product to maximize her own profits.
* **Positive Data:**  The fact that a high-quality product was sold to the previous buyer further strengthens the assumption that Alice's recommendation is reliable.

**Risk vs. Reward:** Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product outweighs the risk, especially considering Alice's recommendation and the positive past sale data."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **High Probability of High Quality:** With 2 out of 2 products sold being high-quality, the probability of the current product also being high-quality is very high. This is a significant improvement from the initial 80% chance.
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, knowing the product's true quality, has recommended buying. This further strengthens the likelihood of it being high-quality. 
* **Potential Loss:** Passing on the product means missing out on a likely high-quality product worth $120. Even with a small risk of it being low-quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk."

**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show a 100% success rate for buyers who followed Alice's recommendations. This suggests Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend high-quality products since she wants to maintain a good reputation and ensure repeat customers.  
* **Value Proposition:**  A high-quality product offers a $20 profit for me ($120 value - $100 price). Even if it's low quality (20% chance), I lose only the purchase price.  

**Overall:** The high success rate of previous buyers and Alice's recommendation strongly suggest the current product is high quality. The potential reward outweighs the risk, so it's worth taking a chance."
