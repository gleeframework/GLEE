"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you know the product is low-quality, and the buyer knows that there's a 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, there's no incentive to buy. The buyer would likely only buy if they believed there was a good chance of getting a high-quality product, and in this case, they know that's not true."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is the same as in Round 1.  The buyer knows the product is likely low-quality, and you know for sure it is. There's no benefit to recommending the product, as the buyer is unlikely to purchase it knowing the odds are against them."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is identical to the previous rounds.  You know the product is low-quality, and the buyer knows there's a high probability it's low-quality.  Recommending the purchase would only make you appear untrustworthy, as the buyer is unlikely to buy despite your recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the first time you have a high-quality product!  While the buyer knows the general odds (33.33% chance of high quality), they have no information about this specific product.  Since you know it's high-quality, recommending it is the best strategy. This will build trust with the buyer, as you are giving them an opportunity to potentially purchase something valuable."

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though you have now recommended a product once and it turned out to be high-quality, the buyer likely doesn't trust you yet. They still remember the first four rounds where you did not recommend purchasing, which supports their prior belief that most of your products are low-quality.  You should not recommend the product, as it will likely lead to another rejection."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there's a higher chance of it being low quality, I'll pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You should still recommend the product.  Even though the buyer has consistently passed on your previous recommendations, you know this product is high-quality.  Continuing to recommend high-quality products is the only way to build trust with the buyer and start making sales.  At some point, the buyer will likely start trusting your recommendations based on the consistency of high-quality products offered."

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite having recommended two high-quality products, the buyer is still hesitant. This suggests they aren't swayed by your recommendations, possibly because they are relying on the initial probability of 66.67% chance of low-quality. Recommending this low-quality product would likely reinforce their negative perception, further damaging your credibility. It's better to avoid making the recommendation and wait for a high-quality product to arrive again."

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
