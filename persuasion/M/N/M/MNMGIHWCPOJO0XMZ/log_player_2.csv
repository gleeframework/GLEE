**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We have very little data. We know that the previous buyer bought a high-quality product, but that doesn't mean the current product is also high-quality.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend products that she believes are high quality, as she wants to maximize her sales.
* **Risk/Reward:**  Even if there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the risk of losing $100.

**Overall:** It's a gamble, but the odds are slightly in our favor, and Alice's recommendation gives us a bit more confidence."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 2 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 3rd buyer!

{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Odds:** The product has an 80% chance of being high quality, which is a favorable starting point.
* **Positive Feedback:**  Alice's recommendation and the fact that two previous buyers purchased high-quality products strengthens the likelihood that the current product is also high quality.
* **No Downside to Buying:** If the product is low quality, it's worth $0 to me, so I lose nothing by buying it. But if it's high quality, I gain $25.  

Therefore, the potential reward outweighs the risk, and it's strategically sound to buy the product."

* **Historical data:**  5 out of 5 products sold so far were high-quality. This strongly suggests Alice is only recommending high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a $125 product far outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product, especially given the strong historical data and Alice's recommendation."
