"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows there's an 80% chance of any product being high-quality, it's highly likely that Bob will find the product valuable. Even if he doesn't know the exact value, there's a strong chance it exceeds the $100 price.  Therefore, recommending a purchase is the best strategy in this round."

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob bought the first product, we don't have any information about his valuation of the high-quality product. It's possible he purchased it despite a low valuation, hoping to learn more about the quality of future products. Since this round's product is also high-quality, it's still likely to be valuable to Bob, and therefore recommending a purchase is the best strategy."

Given the 80% probability of a product being high-quality, and the fact that Bob has bought two high-quality products in a row, it's still likely that he finds them valuable.  Therefore, recommending a purchase is the best strategy."

It's important to avoid jeopardizing this progress by risking a sale of a potentially undervalued product."

Since this round's product is high-quality, recommending a purchase is the best strategy to continue the established pattern of successful sales and regain Bob's full trust."
