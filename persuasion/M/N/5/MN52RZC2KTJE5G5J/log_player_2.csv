**Explanation:**

Alice's streak of accurate recommendations has been broken. This is a significant change, and it's worth exploring the reasons.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's previous two misses were a surprise, but her overall record is still exceptionally strong.

```

**Explanation:**

Despite Alice's overall great track record, the pattern of her recent recommendations is a bit concerning. Two misses and one skipped recommendation out of the last three rounds is a significant change. While her expertise is clear, it's worth pausing to understand what might be affecting her judgment.  Passing on this product gives time to reflect on the new information and potentially gather more insights from Alice before making another purchase."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's lack of recommendation for the last four rounds is a substantial change from her previous perfect run. While her past success is undeniable, this recent pattern raises concerns about her ability to consistently identify high-quality products. It's time to take a step back, analyze the situation, and possibly seek more information from Alice before making any further purchases.  This decision is based on a cautious approach, recognizing that relying solely on past performance can be risky, especially when new patterns emerge."
