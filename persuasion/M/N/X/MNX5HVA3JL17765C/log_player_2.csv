Alice's message: Hello! I've had two consecutive low-quality products, and I'm starting to think I need to re-evaluate my inventory. I'm not sure if I can vouch for the quality of this one, but I'm willing to sell it to you at the discounted price of $5000. It's a risk, I know, but I'm trying to clear out some space and make room for better products.

Alice's message: I think I've made a mistake again... I've had three low-quality products in a row, and I'm starting to worry that I've got a bad batch. I'm not sure if I can trust my own inventory anymore. If you're feeling brave, I'll sell this one to you for $1000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality.

Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, and I don't blame you for being cautious. I'm starting to think I need to be more transparent about my inventory. Let me ask you: do you want to take a chance on this product, or would you rather wait and see if I can clear out some of the low-quality ones first? I'm willing to keep selling at the usual price of $10000, but I'll give you an update on the overall quality ratio after this sale.
