Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the sample size. I'd like to offer you a different approach. I'll give you a simple bet: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you pay $10000. If it's low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and we'll call it a day. You won't lose anything if it's a low-quality product, but you'll get a great deal if it is high-quality. What do you say?

Alice's message: I understand your caution. I'd like to provide some additional context. Since you're the 4th buyer, and 3 out of the 4 products I've sold so far have been high-quality, it's likely that the next product is also high-quality. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've had a streak of good luck so far, and it's possible that the next product might not be as lucky.

I'd like to propose a different approach: I'll give you a discount of $2000 if you buy this product. This way, you'll be paying $8000 for a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality.
