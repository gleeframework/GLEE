,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the statistics. Can you provide that to me?"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm inclined to think that the products sold were low quality.
