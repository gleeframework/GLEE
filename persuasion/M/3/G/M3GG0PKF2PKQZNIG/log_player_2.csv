Alice's message: I've sold 8 products so far, and 7 of them were low-quality. I've still got 2 high-quality products left. To calculate the probability of this product being high-quality, we can use the same math as before. Since I've sold 7 low-quality products out of a total of 8, the probability of this product being low-quality is 7/8 or 87.5%. Therefore, the probability of this product being high-quality is 1 - 7/8 = 1/8 or 12.5%. I know it's not a great odds, but I'm still hoping you'll take a chance on me!
