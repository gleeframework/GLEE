Alice's message: I understand your skepticism! I was being overly optimistic earlier. However, I'd like to reiterate that our products are 80% likely to be high-quality. With only one data point, I know it's not a robust sample size, but I'd like to share that our previous buyer was extremely satisfied with their purchase. I'm willing to offer this product to you at the same price of $100, but I'd like to add that I'll provide a 20% discount on the next product if you buy this one. Would you like to take the chance and experience the quality for yourself?
