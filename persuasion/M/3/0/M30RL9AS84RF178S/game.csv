,,Alice,1,"I have a great product that I think you'll love. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Would you like to take it?",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's high quality or low quality. I'll take the risk and buy it, but if it's low quality, I'll let you know and we can move on to the next product.",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! Since you've already bought one product, I'll give you a special deal on this next one. I'll sell it to you for $9000, which is a 10% discount. It's a great opportunity to get another high-quality product at a lower price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm not sure if this product is high quality or low quality. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I completely understand your caution! I want to assure you that this product is still a great opportunity. Think of it as an investment in our relationship.

,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not sure I believe it. I'll take my chances with the next product.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that this guarantee is genuine. To make it even more compelling, I'll make a bold statement: I'll give you a full refund of $10000 if this product turns out to be low-quality. That's right, you'll get your money back, and I'll still get to keep the product. But if it's high-quality, you'll get an amazing deal at $9000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the refund offer, but I'm not convinced. I'll take my chances with the next product.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a cautious one! I respect that. Let me ask you a question: would you rather have a 20% chance to get a $12000 product for $10000, or a 100% chance to get a $10000 product for $10000? I'm offering you the latter. This product is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product with certainty, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price as the low-quality ones. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I think I'll stick with my original strategy of waiting for the next product. I'm not willing to settle for a product that's worth $10000 when I have a 20% chance of getting a product worth $12000.,no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your strategy, and I respect your decision. However, I'd like to offer you a compromise. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 50/50 chance to buy the next product at the original price of $10000, and the next product after that at 10% off the original price. This way, you'll have a chance to get a high-quality product at the original price, and a potential discount on the next one. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm willing to take the compromise. I'll buy the current product and see what happens with the next two products.,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're willing to take the compromise! Now that you've bought the previous product, I'll give you a special deal on this one. Since you're already getting a 50/50 chance on the next product, I'll give you a 10% discount on this one, making it a steal at $9000. Plus, if you buy this one, I'll throw in a free inspection of the next product, so you'll know for sure whether it's high-quality or not. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not sure I need the free inspection, and I'm not convinced that the 10% discount is worth it. I'll pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I understand your hesitation, but I want to remind you of the compromise we made earlier. You're already getting a 50/50 chance on the next product, and I'm offering you this high-quality product at the original price of $10000. Think of it as a 'free' high-quality product, since you're essentially getting it as part of the deal. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I see what you're doing, Alice. I'll take the 'free' high-quality product and see what happens with the next one.",yes

You'll essentially be getting three high-quality products for the price of two. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not falling for it. I've already got two high-quality products, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at a discount. I'll pass on this one and see what the next product is.",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I respect your caution, Bob. Since you're already on a roll with two high-quality products, I'll give you a straightforward offer. I'll sell you this product at the original price of $10000, and I'll throw in a bonus: I'll give you a $1000 gift card to use on any product in the future. It's a no-brainer, right?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the gift card, but I'm not willing to pay full price for a product when I have a 20% chance of getting a $12000 product for the same price. I'll pass on this one.",no

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,

That's a total of three high-quality products for the price of two, with a significant discount. What do you say?",
