,,Bob,6,"Wait a minute, I don't think you're being honest with me. You said the last one was a'real gem' and now you're saying this one is high-quality too. I'm not sure I believe you. I'll pass on this one.",no

This product is not high-quality, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you. Instead, I'm going to offer it to you for free. Yes, you read that right - free.
