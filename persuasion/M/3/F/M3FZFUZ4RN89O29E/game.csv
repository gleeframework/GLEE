low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. The product I'm offering you is of unknown quality. If you buy it, you'll get to know its quality afterwards. If you don't buy it, I'll offer you another product in the next round. The price is $1000000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've purchased a low-quality product for $1000000. As you can see, the product's quality was not what you were hoping for. Since you've already spent $1000000, I want to assure you that the next product I offer has a higher chance of being high-quality. I'm offering you another product for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $1200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'll take another chance and buy the new product, hoping it's high-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've purchased another low-quality product for $1000000. You've now spent $2000000 on two low-quality products. I want to remind you that the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, considering your previous two purchases, it's likely that the next product is also low-quality. I'm offering you another product for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $1200000. But if you don't buy it, you can wait for the next round and I'll offer you another product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not feeling lucky anymore. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round, hoping to get a better chance at a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've decided to wait for the next round, which is a wise decision. Now, I'm offering you another product for $1000000. Since you've passed on the previous product, I want to give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, considering you've already seen two low-quality products in a row, it's possible that the next product is also low-quality. On the other hand, if you buy this product, you'll get to know its quality immediately, and you can reassess your strategy for the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take another chance and buy the product, hoping to get a high-quality one. Maybe I'll get lucky this time.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Unfortunately, you've purchased another low-quality product for $1000000. You've now spent $3000000 on three low-quality products. I want to be transparent with you - the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but the law of large numbers is starting to work against you. With three low-quality products in a row, it's possible that the next product is also low-quality. However, I'm offering you another product for $1000000. If you buy it, you'll have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $1200000. But if you don't buy it, you can wait for the next round and I'll offer you another product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not feeling optimistic about my chances anymore. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round, hoping to get a fresh start.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've decided to wait for the next round, which is a cautious approach. Now, I'm offering you another product for $1000000. I want to acknowledge that you've had a streak of bad luck, and it's natural to feel skeptical. However, the probability of the next product being high-quality remains 33.33%. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession: I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product, making it $900000. If you buy it, you'll still have a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product worth $1200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the discounted offer and hope that my luck changes. Maybe the discount will bring me better fortune.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"Unfortunately, you've purchased another low-quality product for $900000. You've now spent $4000000 on four low-quality products. I want to be honest with you - the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%, but it's clear that you're experiencing a dry spell. I'm willing to offer you another concession: I'll give you a 20% discount on the next product, making it $800000. Additionally, I'll throw in a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you an additional $100000 on top of the $1200000 value. This way, you'll get a total of $1300000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,"I'll take the discounted offer and the guarantee. I'm willing to take a chance on this one, hoping that the guarantee will make up for my previous losses.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Unfortunately, you've purchased another low-quality product for $800000. You've now spent $4800000 on five low-quality products. I want to acknowledge that you've been dealt a tough hand. However, I want to remind you that the guarantee I offered you in the previous round is still on the table. If you buy the next product and it's high-quality, you'll get a total of $1300000. Considering your previous losses, I'm willing to offer you another concession: I'll give you a 30% discount on the next product, making it $700000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I'm not feeling optimistic about my chances anymore. I'll pass on this one and wait for the next round, hoping to get a fresh start. The guarantee and discounts are tempting, but I don't want to throw more money away on another low-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You've decided to wait for the next round, which is a cautious approach. Now, I'm offering you another product for $1000000. I want to remind you that the guarantee I offered you in the previous round is still on the table, and you can still get a total of $1300000 if you buy the next product and it's high-quality. However, considering your recent streak of low-quality products, I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll give you the option to buy a'safety net' product for $500000. This product is guaranteed to be high-quality, and you'll get a total of $1200000. If you don't want the safety net, you can buy the regular product for $1000000, with the same 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I'll take the safety net product for $500000. I'm willing to pay a premium to guarantee a high-quality product, considering my recent string of losses. The potential reward of $1200000 is worth the extra cost.",yes

You've broken your losing streak and have now spent a total of $5300000. Considering your recent success, I'm willing to offer you another product at the regular price of $1000000. However, I want to remind you that the law of large numbers is still in effect, and it's possible that the next product is also low-quality. On the other hand, if you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll get a total of $2200000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,10,I'll take the chance and buy the regular product for $1000000. I'm feeling optimistic after my recent success and want to keep the momentum going. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that my luck continues.,yes

,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're interested in negotiating the price! Considering your recent success and your willingness to pay a premium, I'm willing to offer you a high-end product worth $1500000. However, I'll need to charge a higher price to reflect the increased value. I'm offering you this product for $1200000. This is a 20% premium over the regular price, but it's still a great deal considering the increased value. If you buy this product and it's high-quality, you'll have a total value of $4900000. What do you say?",
,,Bob,12,"I'll take the high-end product for $1200000. I'm willing to pay the premium for the increased value and potential to increase my total value.
