Alice's message: This product has gone through our standard quality control process.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'd like to observe the quality of the product first before making a purchase.""}\n\nSince the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the expected value of buying the product without knowing its quality is $12,000 * 0.3333 - $10,000 = -$2,000, which is negative. Thus, it's better to pass on this round and gather more information for future rounds."

Given that I've already missed one high-quality product, I'll take the chance and buy this one to avoid potentially missing another opportunity.
