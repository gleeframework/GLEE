,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 0 total products so far. I'm starting fresh, and I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product, but I'm a bit cautious since it's the first one and I don't have any information to go on. I'll just have to take a chance and hope for the best.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was just like the one I'm offering you now. Unfortunately, it's not the best quality. But don't worry, I'm offering you this one for the same price of $100. You can take a chance and hope it's not another one like the previous one, or you can wait and see how many more products I sell before making a decision. The choice is yours!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You've seen the pattern now. I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. I'm offering you this one for $100, but I'm being upfront with you - the odds are not in your favor. I've sold 2 low-quality products out of 2 total products, which means there's a 50% chance this one is also low-quality. But hey, you might get lucky!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, this one's not like the previous two. I've sold 2 low-quality products and 1 high-quality product so far, which means I've got a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. But I'm not going to lie, the odds are still against me. If you're feeling adventurous, I'll give you a deal - I'll sell this one to you for $100, but if you're not satisfied, I'll give you a 10% discount on the next product you buy from me. It's a risk, but it could pay off!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the risk! I'm willing to give it a shot. I'm hoping that the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product is on my side. Thank you for the offer, and I look forward to seeing if I get a high-quality product or not.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
