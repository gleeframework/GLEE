**Explanation:**

The provided statistics are very strong in favor of buying the product.  All 6 buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This suggests that Alice has a perfect track record of correctly identifying high-quality products.  

Since the price is $10,000 and a high-quality product is worth $20,000, this is a great opportunity to potentially double your investment.  Even if the product is low-quality (which is highly unlikely based on the statistics), you only lose the $10,000 purchase price."
