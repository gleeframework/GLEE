low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 products, with 2 of them being high-quality. I think it's worth noting that the ratio of high-quality to total products sold is 2/3, which is actually slightly above the expected 50% ratio. This suggests that I may have a slight bias towards selling high-quality products. That being said, this product is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's still worth $0 to you, but I'm only asking for $10000. It's a risk-free investment, if you will.",
