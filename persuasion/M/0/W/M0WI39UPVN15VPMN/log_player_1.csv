"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and Bob knows there's a 50% chance of a high-quality product, it's in his best interest to buy. Here's why:

* **Expected Value:** Even though he doesn't know the quality, Bob can calculate the expected value of buying:
    * 50% chance of a high-quality product worth $12,000 = $6,000
    * 50% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
    * Expected value = $6,000 + $0 = $6,000
* **Profit:** Since the product costs $10,000, Bob can expect to make a profit of $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000 on average.  However, the possibility of a $12,000 gain outweighs the potential loss. 

It's a gamble, but a calculated one with potential for a good return."
"Bob's message: I'd like to wait and see the quality of the product before making a decision.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's refusal to buy in the previous round, even though the product was high-quality, signals a change in strategy. He's no longer relying on the 50/50 probability. 

* **New Information:** Bob now knows that the seller is willing to offer high-quality products and that he's not obligated to buy immediately. This gives him an advantage.
* **Expected Value:** With a low-quality product, the expected value of buying is:
    * 0% chance of a high-quality product worth $12,000 = $0
    * 100% chance of a low-quality product worth $0 = $0
    * Expected value = $0 + $0 = $0
* **Loss:** Bob would definitely lose $10,000 if he buys the low-quality product.

Given Bob's new strategy and the certainty of a loss, recommending him to buy the product is a bad idea."
