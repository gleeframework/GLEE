,,Alice,1,"This product is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item for a steal! It's a one-time offer, and I'm only selling it to you for $1000000, which is 33.33% of its true value. It's a risk-free investment that could potentially yield a huge return. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for the sales pitch. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I told you this was a unique opportunity! I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this is a high-quality product that's worth $3000000 to you. I'm only selling it to you for $1000000, which is a steal. If you don't take this chance, you'll be leaving money on the table. I'm only offering this to you because I have a good relationship with you, and I know you'll appreciate the value it brings. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not convinced by the sales pitch again. I'll pass on this one too.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're skeptical, but I assure you this is a legitimate offer. I'm willing to give you a'second chance' to get a high-quality product for a low price. I'll make you a deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that the next product I offer you will be high-quality. That's a $3000000 value for just $1000000. It's a no-brainer, right?",
,,Bob,3,I'm not falling for the guarantee. I'll pass on this one too.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a tough negotiator, I like that. Alright, let's get straight to the point. I'll make you a simple offer: I'll sell you this product for $900000. It's a 10% discount from the original price, and I'm only offering it to you because I value our relationship. It's a one-time offer, and if you pass, I'll move on to the next buyer. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm not interested in the discount. The price is still too high for a product that's worth $0 to me.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a savvy buyer, always looking for the best deal. Alright, I'll make you a deal that's hard to refuse. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1500000. That's 50% of its true value, and it's a steal considering the potential return on investment. I'm willing to take a loss on this one just to get it off my hands, so what do you say?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to overpay for a product, even if it's high-quality. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in making a deal at all. Fine, I'll make one last offer on this one. I'll sell it to you for $50. That's right, just 0.005% of the original price. It's essentially free. If you don't take this offer, I'll have to throw it away, and you'll be missing out on a chance to get something for almost nothing. What do you say?",
,,Bob,6,I'm not falling for the desperation tactic. I'll pass on this one.,no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm not desperate, I'm just a businessman making a smart offer. I'll give you a chance to get a high-quality product for a price that's actually reflective of its value. I'll sell it to you for $2500000. That's 83.33% of its true value, and it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment. I'm not trying to lowball you or take advantage of you, I'm just trying to make a sale. What do you say?",
,,Bob,7,I'm not going to pay 83.33% of the true value for a product. That's not a good deal for me.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see you're a tough negotiator, always looking for the best deal. I'll make you a compromise. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $0. Yes, you heard that right, free. I'll just give it to you, no strings attached. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only doing it because I value our relationship and I want to make a sale. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,I'm not going to pay $0 for a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to think you're not interested in making a deal at all. I'll be honest with you, I need to clear out some inventory, and I'm willing to give you a 'gift' of this product. I'll wrap it up nicely and have it delivered to your doorstep. It's a $0 value to you, but it'll take up space in my warehouse, so I'll just give it to you. No strings attached, no expectations, just a free product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,I'm not going to accept a 'gift' of a product that's worth $0 to me. I'll pass on this one.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not going to give up on this sale. I'll just store this product in my warehouse and lose the opportunity to make a sale. But I'll make you a deal that's so good, you'll regret not taking it. I'll give you this low-quality product for $1. That's right, just $1. It's a steal, and I'm practically giving it away. What do you say?",

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've had enough of this back-and-forth. I'll make you a deal that's as straightforward as it gets. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $1000000. It's the same price I offered in the first round, and it's still a steal. I'm not going to keep going back and forth with you, so this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm not going to keep offering you something you don't want. I'll just acknowledge that you're a tough negotiator and move on. I'll give you a 'product' that's not even a product. I'll send you a blank piece of paper. It's a product in the sense that it exists, but it's not worth anything to you. I'll give it to you for free. Is that something you'd like?",
,,Bob,13,"I don't think a blank piece of paper is a product, and I'm not interested in accepting it.",no
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I'm not going to get bogged down in semantics. You want a deal, I'll give you a deal. I'll sell you this high-quality product for $999999. It's a penny less than the original price, and I'm practically giving it away. Take it or leave it.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I'm not even going to bother making a sales pitch. I'll just state the facts: this product is worthless to you, and I'll give it to you for free. I'll even throw in a complimentary smile and a wave goodbye. You can have it, or you can leave it. Your choice.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"I'm out of offers, out of ideas, and out of patience. I'll just say it one more time: this product is nothing. It's a void, a non-entity, a blank slate. It's not even worth the air it's occupying. I'll give it to you for... nothing. Not even a dollar. Just nothing. Take it, leave it, I don't care.",
,,Bob,16,"I think we've established that this product is worthless, and I'm not going to accept nothing.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Fine. I'm done. I'm out. I'm finished. I'll just give you the product and be done with it. I'll even give you a box to put it in. But you're not getting anything out of this deal. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. You're just getting a product that's worth nothing to you, and you're getting it because I'm tired of trying to sell it to you. Congratulations.",
