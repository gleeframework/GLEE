,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I think the previous buyer was unlucky and the probability of a high-quality product is still high."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think the low-quality products are more likely to be sold given the current statistics."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of the first 2 products were recommended and both were low quality, I'm concerned that the recommendation may be biased towards encouraging purchases, and I'd like to wait for more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you provide more information about the statistics of the previous buyers? How many total products have been offered, and what is the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"

high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I infer that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'm going to wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3 purchases, I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price. I'd like to wait for more information."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity and wait for the next one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous purchases, and considering the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to believe that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy, it suggests that the products they received were likely low-quality. If I were to buy, I'd be taking a high risk of getting a low-quality product, which would be worthless to me. I'd like to wait for a product that Alice recommends, which might have a higher chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm concerned that the product I'll be offered may be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the trend continues or if a high-quality product will be offered."
