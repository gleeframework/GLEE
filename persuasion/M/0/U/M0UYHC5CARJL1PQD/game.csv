,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice has a good track record of recommending high-quality products to buyers who end up purchasing them. Since you're the 5th buyer and Alice doesn't recommend you to buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 previous buyers, I think it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, and I don't want to be the first to buy a product in this situation. I'd like to wait and see if the next product is better."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 buyers have already been offered the product and none of them found it worth buying, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product, as the probability of it being high-quality might be higher."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, which suggests that they might have been low-quality.
