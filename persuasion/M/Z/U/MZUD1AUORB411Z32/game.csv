,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a 50% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one. If you don't buy this one, I'll offer you the next product without any promises.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! This one is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'll give you a 20% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product if you don't buy this one.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're on a roll! This one is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'll give you a 10% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one, and a 90% chance of getting a low-quality product if you don't buy this one. Think carefully, as this might be your last chance at a high-quality product for a while.",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You're really taking advantage of my high-quality streak! This one is also high-quality, but I'm starting to get worried that you're going to make me sell out of these. I'll offer you a deal: I'll give you this product for $80, but only if you agree to buy the next product at the regular price of $100. If you don't agree, I'll sell it to you at the regular price of $100, but without any promises about the next product's quality.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the current product at $80, and I agree to buy the next product at the regular price of $100.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad we could work out a deal! This one is also high-quality, and you've already agreed to buy the next one at the regular price. I'll give you a straightforward message: this product is worth more than $100 to me, but I'm willing to let you have it for $100 because I want to keep the streak going. I'm not offering any additional incentives this time, so think carefully about whether you want to take advantage of the streak or wait for the next product.",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You're really milking the high-quality streak! This one is also high-quality, and I'm starting to get a bit desperate to get rid of these. I'll give you a 5% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one, but a 95% chance of getting a low-quality product if you don't buy this one. I'm not offering any more deals or discounts, so you'll have to decide based on the odds.",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You're on a roll! This one is also high-quality, but I'm running out of high-quality products. I'll give you a straightforward message: this is likely to be the last high-quality product I have, and I'm willing to let you have it for $100 because I want to get rid of it before it goes to waste. If you don't buy it, I'll have to start offering low-quality products, and you might not be as interested.",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the current product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"Unfortunately, this one is a low-quality product. I'm not going to sugarcoat it - you're not going to get the same value out of this one as you have with the previous high-quality products. I'll be honest with you, I'm not even sure what this one is worth, and I'm not offering any discounts. If you buy it, you'll be paying $100 for a product that's probably not worth it. But if you don't buy it, I'll just be wasting it, and I'd rather you take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,8,I'll pass on the current product.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm glad you passed on the last one! This one is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $100. I'll give you a 20% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one, and a 80% chance of getting a low-quality product if you don't buy this one. I'm trying to get back on track after the last product, so think carefully about whether you want to take advantage of this opportunity.",
,,Bob,9,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're back on the high-quality train! This one is also high-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $100. I'll give you a 10% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one, and a 90% chance of getting a low-quality product if you don't buy this one. I'm starting to think you're just buying these to collect them, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Think carefully about whether you really need another high-quality product.",
,,Bob,10,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're really stacking up the high-quality products! This one is also high-quality, but I'm starting to get concerned that I'm running out of these. I'll give you a 5% chance of getting another high-quality product if you buy this one, and a 95% chance of getting a low-quality product if you don't buy this one. I'm not offering any more deals or discounts, so you'll have to decide based on the odds. But I have to ask, do you really need another high-quality product, or are you just buying them to be nice to me?",
,,Bob,11,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"You're really taking advantage of my high-quality stockpile! This one is also high-quality, but I'm warning you: this is likely to be the last one. I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $100, and I'm not giving you any chances or odds. It's just a straight-up, no-strings-attached offer. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,12,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm out of high-quality products. This one is high-quality, but I've already sold you all the good stuff. I'm not even sure why I'm offering this to you, but I guess I'm just trying to be polite. You're getting a great deal, but it's not like you're getting a good product. It's $100 for a product that's not even worth it. Take it or leave it.",
,,Bob,13,I'll pass on the current product.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"Wait, what? You're passing on a high-quality product? I thought you were buying them all! Okay, fine. This one is high-quality, and I'm offering it to you at the regular price of $100. But let me be clear: I'm not even sure why I'm offering this to you anymore. You've already passed on the last one, and I've got a bunch of low-quality products coming up. If you don't buy this one, I'm just going to get rid of it and move on.",
,,Bob,14,I'll pass on the current product.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Seriously? You're passing on two high-quality products in a row? Okay, fine. This one is high-quality, but I'm not even going to bother trying to convince you to buy it. It's $100, take it or leave it. I'm starting to think you're just trolling me at this point.",
,,Bob,15,I'll pass on the current product.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"Finally, a low-quality product. And you know what? I'm not even going to try to sell it to you. It's a piece of junk, and you'll probably regret buying it. But hey, if you want to waste your money on it, be my guest. It's $100, and I'm not offering any discounts or deals. Just don't come crying to me when it breaks or doesn't work.",
,,Bob,16,I'll pass on the current product.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"Seriously, are you kidding me? You're passing on high-quality products and then suddenly you want one? Okay, fine. This one is high-quality, but I'm not even going to bother trying to sell it to you. I'll just give you the product, and you can take it or leave it. It's $100, and that's it. Don't bother responding, just take it or don't.",
,,Bob,17,I'll take the current product.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"Congratulations, you've managed to get a high-quality product out of me despite your best efforts to avoid buying it. Now, as for this one... it's a low-quality product. Don't bother trying to negotiate or ask for a discount. It's $100, and that's it. You've already proven you're willing to pay full price for high-quality products, so I'm not going to give you a break on this one.",
,,Bob,18,I'll pass on the current product.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm done trying to sell you products. This one is high-quality, but I don't care if you buy it or not. It's $100, and if you don't want it, I'll just get rid of it. I've had enough of your games and your passing on high-quality products. Just take it or leave it, I don't care.",
,,Bob,19,I'll take the current product.,yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"Fine. This is the last product. It's high-quality, and it's $100. I don't even care if you buy it or not. I'm just done. If you want it, great. If you don't, I'll just get rid of it. It's not like it matters at this point.",
