,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I know the probability of it being high quality is 33.33%, but I also know that I have the first pick and can set the precedent for future buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice does not recommend it and the previous buyer did not buy it. This makes me suspicious that the product might be low-quality."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you explain why you think it's not worth buying? I'd like to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5000 for it, considering the high probability of it being low quality and the lack of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products. I'd like to see the proportion of high-quality products sold so far."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that you don't recommend it, and considering the statistics, I'm inclined to think that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the probability of it being high-quality, not your recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could explain the reasoning behind your recommendation. Given that 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product, and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that you might be biased towards recommending low-quality products. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to understand your thought process."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on past data. With 7 buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product has a better chance of being high-quality."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 7, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, considering Alice's recommendation, it seems she might be trying to sell low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 7 buyers have passed on the products with no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high-quality or low-quality based on your past recommendations. Since 7 out of 7 buyers have passed on the products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely low. I'll pass on this product as well."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I'll get it for $10000, which is a good deal compared to the expected value of $0."
