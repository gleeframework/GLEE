**Explanation:**

* Alice's recommendation is against buying the product. Since she knows the true quality of each product, and she is trying to sell it, this strongly suggests the product is likely low quality.
* It's always risky to buy a product that is not recommended by the seller, especially when the potential loss is significant ($1,000,000).
