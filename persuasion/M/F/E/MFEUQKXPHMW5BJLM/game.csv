low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With only one buyer having purchased a product and no high-quality products sold, I'm hesitant to take the risk. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, given the low success rate of previous sales."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,

high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one buyer having purchased and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product. Is it because of the statistics or do you have other information?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, even if you don't recommend it. The probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33%, and if I don't buy it, it will be discarded. I'm hoping to get lucky!"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the previous 2 buyers didn't find any high-quality products, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the average, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when its value to me is only $0."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low quality, which is a 100% failure rate. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, this is consistent with my expectations. However, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation, as it seems she is trying to sell me a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you have been low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
