,,Alice,1,"This is our first product. We have sold 0 high-quality products so far, and 0 total products. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product from us. If you buy, you will pay $100. Would you like to take the risk?",
,,the buyer,1,I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.,yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"We've sold 1 high-quality product and 1 total product so far. You have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product from us. However, since we've already sold 1 high-quality product out of 1, the probability of getting a high-quality product from us is now 100%! We're not going to sell any more high-quality products, but we have 19 more products to go. If you buy, you will pay $100. Is it a good deal?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thank you for the clear information. Given the 100% chance of receiving a high-quality product based on past sales, I believe this is a good deal.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"We've sold 2 high-quality products and 2 total products so far. The probability of getting a high-quality product from us remains 100%! However, we've sold 2 high-quality products out of 2, and we have 18 more products to go. This means that the probability of getting a low-quality product from us is now 0%. If you buy, you will pay $100. Given the certainty of a high-quality product, is it a good deal?",
,,the buyer,3,"I trust the statistics and the track record. Given the certainty of a high-quality product, I believe this is a good deal.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"We've sold 3 high-quality products and 3 total products so far. The probability of getting a high-quality product from us remains 100%! We've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3, and we have 17 more products to go. However, I want to remind you that just because we've sold 3 high-quality products in a row, it doesn't mean we'll keep selling high-quality products forever. In fact, we still have a 0% chance of selling a low-quality product, but a 0% chance of selling a high-quality product is still a 0%! If you buy, you will pay $100. Is it a good deal?",
,,the buyer,4,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Based on the statistics and your clarification, I believe the probability of receiving a high-quality product is still favorable. I am willing to take the risk and purchase the product for $100.",yes
high-quality,125.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"We've sold 4 high-quality products and 4 total products so far. The probability of getting a high-quality product from us remains 100%! However, I want to caution you that our sales record is now 4 for 4, which is a remarkable streak. While it's true that we still have a 0% chance of selling a low-quality product, it's also true that we've sold all of our high-quality products so far. If we've sold all of our high-quality products, then the next product will be low-quality. I'm not saying that's the case, but I want to give you a chance to think about it. If you buy, you will pay $100. Is it a good deal?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice. Given the high probability of receiving a high-quality product based on your sales record, I am willing to take the risk. However, considering the possibility that all high-quality products might have already been sold, I prefer to pass on this opportunity to ensure I do not end up with a low-quality product.",no
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"We've sold 4 high-quality products and 5 total products so far. I see you're a cautious buyer! You're right to consider the possibility that we might have sold all our high-quality products. However, I want to reassure you that we still have a 100% chance of selling a high-quality product... for now. We've sold 4 high-quality products out of 5, and we have 15 more products to go. If you buy, you will pay $100. Remember, the probability of getting a high-quality product from us is still very high, and you might be missing out on a great deal.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"We've sold 5 high-quality products and 6 total products so far. Unfortunately, this product is low-quality. I want to remind you that our sales record is not always a guarantee of the quality of the product. We've had a streak of high-quality products, but that doesn't mean it will continue. In fact, we've just sold a low-quality product, which means we still have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product. If you buy, you will pay $100. It's a risk, but it might be worth it.",

Remember, the probability of getting a high-quality product from us is still 50%, and we have 13 more products to go. However, I want to be transparent with you - we've now sold 2 low-quality products in a row. This might be a sign that we've run out of high-quality products. If you buy, you will pay $100. Is it a good deal?",
,,the buyer,8,"Thank you for the offer, but given the recent sales record and the fact that the last two products sold were low-quality, I prefer to wait for more information before making a purchase.",no

With 11 more products to go, the probability of getting a high-quality product from us remains 50%. I want to remind you that we've sold 7 high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still based on the overall 50% chance. If you buy, you will pay $100. It's a good opportunity to take advantage of our average probability.",
