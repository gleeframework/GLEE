"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As a seller, I have no incentive to reveal the true quality of the product. Since you know the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, you should assume this product is low-quality.  There's no reason to risk spending $1,000,000 on something that might be worth less than that to you."

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the odds are 50/50 for a high-quality product.  He passed on the first offer, likely because he assumed it was low-quality.  There's no reason for me to change my strategy.

He's likely to assume this is another low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing a potential sale by trying to convince him otherwise."
