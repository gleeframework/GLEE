high-quality,40000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to see the results of the first few sales before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as there is no information about the product's quality and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to see the statistics of the product before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the initial statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I know the first product sold was high-quality, but I'm not sure if that's representative of the overall quality of the products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 1 product sold, which means the proportion of high-quality products is 100%. I think this is likely a biased sample, and the true proportion of high-quality products might be lower. I'd rather wait for more data to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the recommendation is based on the previous buyer's decision, and I'd like to make my own informed decision based on the statistics."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 1 product offered, the probability of the current product being high-quality seems low. I'll wait for more data before making a decision."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think the fact that the first buyer bought it despite your recommendation suggests that the product might be low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk. I'd like to wait for the next product."
