**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** We only know that one high-quality product has been sold, and Alice is recommending the current product. This doesn't tell us much about the quality of the current product.
* **Expected Value:**  Even though the odds are 50/50, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($1,200,000) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).
* **Decision:** In this scenario, it's a gamble, but the expected value favors buying.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified model. In a real-world scenario, the buyer would consider factors like the seller's reputation, the potential cost of getting a low-quality product, and their own risk tolerance."
