Alice's message: I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 4 total products so far. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, I'd expect to have sold at least 1.33 high-quality products by now.

Alice's message: I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 14 total products so far, and 9 low-quality products. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to provide you with more information. Our new quality control expert has implemented a rigorous testing and inspection process for all products, including X-ray scanning, material analysis, and quality checks by multiple team members. We've also implemented a new inventory management system to track the quality of each product as it's produced. Unfortunately, this product is one of the ones that didn't make the cut. It's low-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000. It's a risk, but it's also a very low price for a product that's essentially worthless to me.

Alice's message: I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 15 total products so far, and 10 low-quality products. I'll be honest with you, the new quality control process has been catching a lot of low-quality products, and it's possible that the probability of a product being low-quality is actually higher than 33.33%. In fact, based on our data, it's looking like the probability of a product being low-quality is more like 60%.

Alice's message: I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 16 total products so far, and 10 low-quality products. I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide you with more data. Our quality control process involves a combination of X-ray scanning, material analysis, and quality checks by multiple team members. We've been tracking the results, and it appears that the new process is indeed catching more low-quality products. Here are the numbers: out of the last 10 products we've produced, 7 have been low-quality, and 3 have been high-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being low-quality is indeed higher than 33.33%. However, I want to emphasize that this is still a relatively small sample size, and we're working to refine the process to improve the quality of our products.
