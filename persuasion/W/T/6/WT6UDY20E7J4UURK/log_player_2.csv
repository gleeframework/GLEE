Alice's message: You're a savvy buyer! I like that. Given the current statistics, the expected value of this product is a bit more nuanced. With 6 high-quality products out of 10 and 4 low-quality products out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. However, if I were to have a higher proportion of high-quality products, I would have sold more high-quality products by now. But I didn't. I sold a low-quality product. So, the expected value of this product is simply the probability of it being high-quality multiplied by its value, which is $1250000, plus the probability of it being low-quality multiplied by its value, which is $0. That's $625000. However, I'll give you a different perspective: if I were to be intentionally trying to mislead you, I would have sold a high-quality product after the previous low-quality product, to make it seem like I have a higher proportion of high-quality products.
