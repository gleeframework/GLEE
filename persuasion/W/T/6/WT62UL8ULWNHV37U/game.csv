Based on the 80% success rate, I'd expect 9.6 high-quality products (0.8 * 12), but there have been only 2 high-quality products sold. This seems to be a deviation from the expected value. Considering this, I'd estimate the probability of this product being high-quality to be around 60%. I'll take a chance and buy the product, but I'll do so with a lower expectation of its quality.",yes
