As for my confidence in the current product being high-quality, it's based on the fact that the previous two products were low-quality, which means that the probability of a product being high-quality is now higher. Additionally, I've been in the business long enough to develop a sense of intuition and expertise in identifying high-quality products. I'm not just relying on chance or probability, but rather a combination of experience and knowledge.
