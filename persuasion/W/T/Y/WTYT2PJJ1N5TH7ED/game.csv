,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to wait and see the quality of the first product sold, as it will give me an idea of the proportion of high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to take the risk and buy the product as a first mover, hoping to get a high-quality product, and I'll make my decision based on the product's quality rather than Alice's recommendation."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous two products were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality might be lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like all previous products recommended by you were low quality, which makes me skeptical about the current product. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or consider the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision. Can you tell me the total number of products sold so far and the proportion of high-quality products sold?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I think this is a contrarian play given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced that the product is high quality based on the previous sales record. Since no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the probability of this product being high quality is still 50%.

,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers who purchased the products?

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were recommended by you and none of them were high-quality, which suggests that your recommendations are not reliable. I'll pass on this product and wait for the next one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the fact that you don't recommend me to buy the product, I'm assuming it's low quality. Since the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/4, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50%. I'll pass on the product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation given the previous sales record. With 4 buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to pass on this product and see what happens next."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because of the lack of high-quality products sold so far, or is there another reason?"

,,Alice,17,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products sold were low-quality.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation to buy, and none of them bought a high-quality product. This suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
