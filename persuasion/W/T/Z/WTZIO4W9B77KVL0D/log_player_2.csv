**Reasoning:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, and we know she has access to the quality of the product.  This strongly suggests the product is high-quality.
* **Statistics:**  2 out of 2 products sold so far have been high quality. This is a 100% success rate, which is much higher than the 80% base probability of a high-quality product.

While there's always a 20% chance it could be low quality, the data strongly suggests it's worth the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 3 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 2 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 4th buyer!

**Explanation:**

* **Probability:** The historical data shows a high probability of the product being high quality (3 out of 4 sold products were high quality). 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the likelihood of a high-quality product. 
* **Potential Gain:** Even with a 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential gain of $40,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 5 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 4 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 6th buyer!

```

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  The seller has a track record of 80% high-quality products (4 out of 5 sold). This is significantly higher than the overall probability of 80% for a high-quality product.  
* **Recommendation:**  Alice's recommendation provides additional confidence, as she has access to information about the current product's quality that you don't. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even if the product is low quality (20% chance), you lose $10,000. However, if it's high quality (80% chance), you make a profit of $30,000. The potential reward outweighs the potential risk."

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation:** Alice recommending the product is a positive signal, as she's likely to be biased towards recommending products she believes are good. 
* **The statistics:** 5 high-quality products out of 6 sold is an incredibly strong signal.  The probability of this happening purely by chance is extremely low, especially given the 80% chance of a product being high quality. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance the product is low quality, the potential reward of a $40,000 gain significantly outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
