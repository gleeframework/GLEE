"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the potential gain of $2,000 from a high-quality product outweighs the potential loss of $10,000 from a low-quality product.  It's a gamble, but a calculated one.  The fact that Alice is recommending it doesn't necessarily mean anything since she doesn't know the true value to you, but it's still a positive signal."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for letting me know, Alice. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation not to buy is a significant signal. While it's possible she's just being cautious, it's more likely she has reason to believe this product is low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worthless to me, it's not worth the risk of losing $10,000."

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation isn't a guarantee, it's a positive signal, especially after the previous round where her non-recommendation turned out to be correct. The potential gain ($2,000) still outweighs the risk ($10,000) considering the 80% chance of it being high quality."
