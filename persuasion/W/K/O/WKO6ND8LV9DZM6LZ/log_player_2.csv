Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product! We're glad to hear that you're interested in it. Since you're aware of our success rate, you might be wondering what makes this product different. Let's be transparent - this product is not one of our high-quality ones. However, we're willing to offer it to you for the same price as the previous buyer, $1000000. We believe it's still a fair price considering the potential benefits it could bring, even if it's not a high-quality product. What do you think? Will you take a chance on it?

Alice's message: I see what you're getting at! Given that we've sold 6 high-quality products out of 20, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher than 50%. In fact, it's 30% (6/20). But when we condition on the fact that we've already sold 6 high-quality products, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually higher. Let me do the calculation for you... Ah, yes! Given that we've sold 6 high-quality products out of 20, the probability of a product being high-quality is actually 50%. That's right, 50%!
