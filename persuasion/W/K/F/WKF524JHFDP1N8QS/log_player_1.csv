This way, you can be sure that the product is indeed the high-quality one we discussed.

This one is a high-quality item, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. Remember, you just passed up on a low-quality product last round, and now you have a chance to make up for it.

However, I do have a special situation with this product. It's a discontinued model, and I'm only offering it to you because I think you might appreciate its unique features.
