,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not sure about the product's quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me. Can I pass on this one and see what happens with the next product? Maybe the statistics will give me a better idea of the product's quality."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just take a chance."

,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds and get a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high quality based on the previous sales record. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, so I'm not influenced by your recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"Based on the fact that 3 out of 3 buyers have bought the product despite no high-quality products being sold, I suspect that Alice is recommending low-quality products to buyers. I'm going to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get a good deal."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the products sold were low-quality. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm inclined to believe that the product I'm being offered is also low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that the previous products were all low-quality, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll take the chance."

,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to test the probability of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 7 previous buyers have purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,17,yes,
