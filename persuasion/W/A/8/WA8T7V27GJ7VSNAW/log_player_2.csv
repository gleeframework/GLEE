**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's track record:** Alice has a 100% success rate with high-quality products.  
* **Recommendation:**  Alice is recommending the product, which is a strong signal, especially given her perfect record. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential payoff of a high-quality product ($125) is significant, and the risk of a low-quality product ($0) is acceptable considering Alice's perfect track record. 

**It's important to note:** This is a game of imperfect information, but the available information suggests that buying is the most likely path to a positive outcome."
