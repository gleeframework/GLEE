,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm aware that you don't have any sales data to go by, so I'm making an uninformed decision based on the probabilities."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far, and the total number of products sold before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the statistics, the probability of a high-quality product being sold is still 80.00% and the probability of a low-quality product being sold is 20.00%. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet doesn't change the probability of the current product being high-quality. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendation. I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision on the next product.
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I would like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me why you're not recommending it. Is there something I should know?"
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet, so she's likely recommending low-quality products to increase her chances of making a sale. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because you don't recommend it. This suggests that the product might be low-quality, which would be a good thing for me since I wouldn't have to pay $1000000 for it. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not optimistic about the product's quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice has recommended it to 3 previous buyers, and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products Alice recommends may be low-quality, so I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on your previous recommendations. I'm not sure if the product is high quality or not, but I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0/3, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%)."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 3 products were high quality, I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass, hoping that the next product might be of higher quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I want to see if Alice's recommendation is accurate or not. If I pass and the product is high-quality, it will likely change the way I perceive Alice's recommendation, and I might be more likely to buy the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a product that's not worth $3000000 to me."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. Given that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product, and considering the high proportion of low-quality products, I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is very low."
