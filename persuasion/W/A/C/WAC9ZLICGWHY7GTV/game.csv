high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure what its quality is. I'll take the risk, hoping it's high quality."

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation might be biased towards discouraging purchases, and I want to see the product's quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the recommendation reason, though. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold is too low, or is there another reason?"

high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the current statistics, it seems like the probability of a high-quality product being sold is around 50%. However, since only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, it's possible that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is actually lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."

,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that you recommended it, but only 1 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the product. I'd like to wait and see if the next buyer will purchase it before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I want to see more data before making a decision.
