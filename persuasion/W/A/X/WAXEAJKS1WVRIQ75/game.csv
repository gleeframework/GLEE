high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I don't know the quality yet.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll take a chance. I know the previous product was high-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one. Two high-quality products in a row is a coincidence. The probability is still 80% for a high-quality product, but I'll be more cautious this time."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row is unlikely, so I'll take the chance. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,Four high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely. I think the probability of a low-quality product is higher than 20% now. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,Five high-quality products in a row is almost impossible. I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is actually higher than 80%.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,no,Six high-quality products in a row is absurd. I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 80%.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row is still extremely unlikely, but I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to trick me into buying a low-quality product. I'll take the chance and buy this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,Eight high-quality products in a row is completely implausible. I'm going to assume that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying, which means she knows the product is low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,I just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'm going to be more cautious from now on. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll take a chance. The previous product was high-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,no,"Two high-quality products in a row, but I'm not getting complacent. I'll keep a cautious approach and pass on this one."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row is still unlikely, but I'll take the chance. The probability of a high-quality product is still 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,Four high-quality products in a row is getting suspicious. I'll be cautious and pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Alice is recommending against buying again, which means she knows the product is low-quality. I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,I just lost $1000000 on a low-quality product. I'm going to be even more cautious from now on. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take a chance. The previous product was high-quality, so the probability of this one being high-quality is still 80%."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,Five high-quality products in a row is extremely unlikely. I'm going to assume that Alice is trying to manipulate me into buying a low-quality product. I'll pass on this one.
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round. I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
