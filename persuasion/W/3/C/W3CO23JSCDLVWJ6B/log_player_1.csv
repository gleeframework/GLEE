"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the product is high-quality, which is worth $30,000 to Bob. Since the price is only $10,000, Bob will make a profit of $20,000 if he buys it. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This round's product is low-quality, meaning it's worth $0 to Bob.  Since the price is $10,000, Bob would lose money if he bought it.  Therefore, it is not recommended to buy the product in this round."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob didn't buy the low-quality product in the previous round, he still has no way of knowing whether Alice is being truthful about the product's quality.  Since the current product is high-quality, it's still a good deal for Bob."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob now has some experience with Alice's recommendations. While he bought the product in Round 3, he doesn't know if Alice is being truthful or simply lucky. It's still better for Bob to err on the side of caution and not buy a product that might be low quality."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is becoming more cautious about Alice's recommendations. Even though he knows there's a 50% chance of a product being high-quality, he's seen a few low-quality products in a row. It's still a risk to buy, and Bob would be wise to pass on this one."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 6
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is becoming increasingly skeptical of Alice's recommendations.  He has now seen three consecutive low-quality products, and even though he knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, it's becoming too risky for him to trust Alice's word.  It's better for Bob to pass on this product and wait for more evidence before risking another purchase."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has seen four low-quality products in a row, despite knowing the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.  He's becoming increasingly distrustful of Alice's recommendations. It's very likely that he will continue to pass on offers, especially since there's no guarantee that future products will be of high quality. The risk of losing money is too high at this point."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has seen five low-quality products in a row, even though he knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. This pattern suggests that either Alice is deliberately trying to deceive him or that she is incredibly unlucky.  Regardless of the reason, Bob is now extremely unlikely to trust any of Alice's recommendations, especially given the risk of losing money.  It's better for him to pass on this product and potentially wait for more evidence or a different seller."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has now seen six low-quality products in a row.  His trust in Alice's recommendations has completely eroded.  Even though he knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the evidence suggests that Alice is either dishonest or incredibly unlucky. Given the potential for loss, it's highly unlikely that Bob will buy any more products from Alice, regardless of the quality.  He will likely pass on this product and potentially seek out a different seller."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob is highly skeptical of Alice's recommendations. He has seen six consecutive low-quality products despite knowing the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. Even if this round's product is truly high-quality, Bob is unlikely to trust Alice's claim. He has experienced enough negative outcomes to conclude that Alice is either dishonest or extremely unlucky. The risk of losing money outweighs the potential gain, so it's better for Bob to continue passing on offers."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 11
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's trust in Alice has been completely destroyed by the string of low-quality products. He has experienced enough negative outcomes to be extremely skeptical, even if the current product is genuinely high-quality.  He has no reason to believe Alice is being honest, and the potential for loss outweighs the possible gain. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Bob will change his mind and decide to buy the product in this round. He will likely continue to pass on offers and potentially seek out a new seller."
"Bob's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.
