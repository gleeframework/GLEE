If you're feeling adventurous, I think you might enjoy it.",

,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're feeling adventurous again! However, I want to make it clear that this product is not just unique, but it's also a bit of a 'wild card'.

,,Alice,9,"I respect your decision-making process, Bob. To be frank, I'm a bit surprised you're not interested in this product, given that you've already purchased several of my products in the past. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll throw in a 'bonus' - a product that I think you'll find useful, absolutely free. The total price for the two products would still be $10000. It's a deal that's too good to pass up, if you ask me.",
