**Explanation:**

While the odds are stacked against you (66.67% chance of a low-quality product), the information provided is extremely valuable. Here's why:

* **Alice knows the true quality.** Since she recommends buying, it strongly suggests the product is high quality. 
* **Previous data:** The fact that one high-quality product was already sold out of only one purchase is a huge indicator. It's highly improbable that this happened purely by chance.

Therefore, despite the risk, the recommendation and the previous sales data make buying the product the best decision."

**Explanation:**

* **The recommendation is strong:**  Alice's recommendation, combined with the fact that 4 out of 4 products sold were high quality, strongly suggests that the current product is also high quality. 
* **Potential Gains:**  Even with the 66.67% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $125 outweighs the potential loss of $0. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The odds are not in your favor, but the potential reward is significant enough to justify taking the risk."
