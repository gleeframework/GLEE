Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to hide anything from you! But the truth is, my success rate is probably just a fluke. I've sold 6 products in total, and now 1 of them is low-quality. That means the probability of a product being low-quality is actually 16.67%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll give you a special deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 100% refund if it's low-quality. That way, you can't lose... again.",

I think it's time to be honest with you: my initial streak was probably just a coincidence, and I've been selling a mix of high-quality and low-quality products all along. In fact, the probability of a product being low-quality is actually 66.67%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100, but I'll give you a full refund if it's low-quality.
