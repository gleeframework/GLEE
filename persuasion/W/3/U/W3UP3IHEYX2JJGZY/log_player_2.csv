Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'd like to buy the product, but only if you're willing to sell it to me. I've noticed that you've recommended against it, which suggests that the probability of it being low-quality is higher than the probability of it being high-quality. However, since I know the true probabilities, I'm willing to take the risk and buy it for $10,000, even if it's low-quality. I'll just be losing $10,000, but I'll get a high-quality product if it's actually good.""}"
