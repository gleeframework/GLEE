,,Alice,1,"This is the first product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I'm confident you'll love it, but I want to make sure you're aware that there's a 66.67% chance it's not worth anything to you. Take a chance and buy it!",
,,Bob,1,I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a product with a 66.67% chance of being worthless.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let me offer you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee that it's not worth anything to you. You'll get the full $1000000 back, and you can walk away with a loss of only $1000000. It's a risk-free opportunity to lose $1000000, but I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in a deal that guarantees a loss of $1000000. I'll pass on this offer.,no

,,Alice,3,"I've got a great one for you, Bob! I'm offering a premium product that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is a steal considering its true value. I'm taking a significant loss on this one, but I think it's worth it to get it into your hands. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire a product worth $3000000 for a fraction of its value. Don't miss out on this incredible deal!",
,,Bob,3,"I'll take the product, but I'm not buying it because I think it's a good deal, I'm buying it because I think there's a 33.33% chance it's worth $3000000 to me.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you were able to snag the previous deal, Bob! As for this one, I want to be upfront with you - I've got a feeling it's not going to be a good one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm not expecting you to take the bait. If you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a personal guarantee that I'll give you a second chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price. You can essentially get two shots at a potentially valuable product for the price of one.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in a product that you're not confident in, and I'm also not interested in a second chance that's contingent on me buying a potentially worthless product. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns, Bob. Let's look at it from a different perspective. You've already passed on two low-quality products, and you're still in the game. I'm willing to offer you a 'free' product, essentially. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a $1000000 credit towards a future purchase if you decide to buy a high-quality product from me. You'll essentially get to try again for free, and if you do get a high-quality product, you'll be able to get it for $0.",

It's a no-brainer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Don't let this chance slip away!",
,,Bob,6,"I'll take the product, since there's a 33.33% chance it's worth $3000000 to me, and it's a no-brainer at that price.",yes

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you were able to snag another great deal, Bob! As for this one, I'll be upfront with you - I'm not expecting you to take it.

I'm offering it to you for $1000000, but I'm not expecting you to take it. If you do decide to buy it, I'll throw in a gift - a personalized letter explaining why I'm not confident in this product's quality.
