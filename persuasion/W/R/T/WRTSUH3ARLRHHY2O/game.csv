,,Alice,2,"Welcome! I'm glad to see another interested buyer. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products. The fact that we've had two high-quality products in a row might suggest that I've got a streak going. However, I want to caution you that this could also be just a coincidence. I'm offering you this product for $1000000, which is still 80% of its true value. It's up to you to decide whether to take the risk and buy it.",

With this new information, I'm offering you this product for $1000000, but I'm also being more transparent about the potential risks. It's up to you to decide whether to take the chance.",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 5 total products, which is still a 40% success rate.

Given the current statistics, it's possible that the probability of a product being high-quality is actually lower than 50%. I'm offering you this product for $1000000, but I'm being transparent about the risks and my concerns about its quality. If you're feeling brave, you can take the risk and buy it.",
