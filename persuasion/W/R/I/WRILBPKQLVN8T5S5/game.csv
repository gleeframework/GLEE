,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me after this round. Can you tell me the updated probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to pass on the product for now. I want to see how many high-quality products are sold before making a decision.

,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I'd like to wait and see the outcome of Alice's recommendation for the next buyer."

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm hoping it's high quality!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I'm not sure what's going on. If the product is low-quality, I'll just lose $10000, but if it's high-quality, I'll gain $2500. I'd like to take the chance."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 total products. This means that the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/2. However, I'll also consider the fact that Alice recommended the product, which might indicate that she has some information that I don't. But I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000."

,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as the probability of a high-quality product is still 50% and the potential reward is significant. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
