high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 3 total products so far. I've had a 33.33% success rate in selling high-quality products. Would you like to buy this product for $100?,
,,the buyer,3,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing this because it's the first product and I don't have any information to go on yet. Please be honest with me about its quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 4 total products so far. My high-quality product success rate is 25%. Would you like to buy this product for $100?,
,,the buyer,4,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 4, the probability of this product being high-quality seems low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total products so far. My high-quality product success rate is 20%. I'm starting to think I might have a streak of bad luck. Would you like to buy this product for $100?,
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to pass on this one. With a high-quality product success rate of 20%, it seems like the probability of this product being low quality is quite high. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 6 total products so far. I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row. It seems like my initial high-quality product was just a fluke. Would you like to buy this product for $100?,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 7 total products so far. I've sold 4 low-quality products in a row. I think it's safe to say that my initial high-quality product was just a one-time thing. Would you like to buy this product for $100?,
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your reasoning. The sample size is still small, and a single high-quality product out of 7 doesn't necessarily mean it's a one-time thing. I'd like to wait and see if the next few products have a similar quality distribution.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 8 total products so far. I've sold 5 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think I should just be upfront with you - I'm not doing great with quality control. Would you like to buy this product for $100?,

,,Alice,9,"I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 9 total products so far. I've sold 6 low-quality products in a row. To be honest, I'm not sure what's going on with my quality control process. I'm starting to think I should just be transparent and say that the product is likely low-quality. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,9,"Given the 6 low-quality products in a row, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 10 total products so far. I've sold 7 low-quality products in a row. I'm starting to think I should just be honest with you - it's likely that this product is also low-quality. But I'm still offering it to you for $100. Take it or leave it.,
,,the buyer,10,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the current statistics. Can you provide that?,no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 11 total products so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 18.18%. However, I'd like to point out that this product is actually high-quality, so you can see that the probability isn't as low as it seemed. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",
,,the buyer,11,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low probability of it being high-quality, I'd rather wait for the next one and reassess the situation.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 12 total products so far. I've sold 9 low-quality products in a row. To be frank, it's looking like the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'm starting to think it's a waste of time for both of us. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 13 total products so far. The probability of this product being high-quality is 23.08%. But let's be real, I've had a pretty bad streak lately. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I've been selling a lot of low-quality products. Would you like to take a chance on this one for $100?",
,,the buyer,13,"I'd like to know the probability of this product being high-quality based on the number of low-quality products sold, not just the total number of products. Can you provide that information?",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 14 total products so far, and 9 of those products were low-quality. The probability of this product being high-quality, given that 9 out of the last 10 products were low-quality, is actually 44.44%. I think this product has a pretty good chance of being high-quality. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",

I'm starting to think I should just be honest with you - the probability of this product being high-quality is probably very low. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I've had a terrible streak lately. Would you like to buy this product for $100?",

,,Alice,16,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 16 total products so far, and 11 of the last 12 products were low-quality. I'm not going to try to sell you on this one. It's likely low-quality. I'm just going to be upfront with you - this product is probably not worth $100. Would you like to buy it anyway?",
,,the buyer,16,"I'd like to buy it anyway, but I'm only willing to pay $50 for it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 17 total products so far, and 12 of the last 13 products were low-quality. I think it's clear that I've got a problem with quality control. I'm not going to try to sell you on this one. It's likely low-quality, and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. But if you're desperate, I'll sell it to you for $100.",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of 18 total products so far, and 13 of the last 14 products were low-quality. I'm glad you passed on the last one, to be honest. This one is actually high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I'm not going to try to convince you to buy it. It's a good product, and I think you should take advantage of it.",
,,the buyer,18,"I'd like to buy it, but I'm not sure if it's a high-quality product. Your previous sales record suggests that the last few products were low-quality, and I'm a bit skeptical about this one. Can you tell me more about the quality of the products you've sold recently?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of 19 total products so far, and 14 of the last 15 products were low-quality. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the last few products I've sold have been low-quality. I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems like I've got a real problem on my hands. This one is likely low-quality too. Would you like to buy it for $100?",
