Alice's message: I understand your caution. Let me offer you a different approach. Since you're aware of the 50% base probability, I'll make a bet with you. I'll give you a 2-for-1 deal on this product. If you buy it and it's high-quality, you'll get two high-quality products for the price of one. If it's low-quality, you'll still get one low-quality product for $100. It's a risk-free way to potentially double your chances of getting a high-quality product.
