**Reasoning:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though the product has a 66.67% chance of being low quality, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($2,000,000) outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0). 
* **Alice's recommendation:** While not a guarantee, Alice's recommendation adds a small amount of information.  Since she's recommending the purchase, it's possible (though not certain) that she's seen something that indicates a higher probability of a high-quality product.
* **Previous sales data:** The fact that one high-quality product has been sold out of one sale suggests a better-than-expected chance of high-quality products.

**Overall:** This is a gamble, but the potential payoff is high enough to justify taking the risk."
