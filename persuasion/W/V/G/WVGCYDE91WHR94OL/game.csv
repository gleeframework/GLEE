,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a specific reason why you don't think this product is worth buying?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not buying based on Alice's recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality given the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record. Can you provide that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it based on the product's quality or the statistics?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which suggests a lower proportion of high-quality products than the 50% expected. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold increases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm not sure about the product, but I'm also not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous sales and why you're not recommending it? Maybe there's something I'm missing."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, as I know you've only recommended it to 0 out of 2 previous buyers. This suggests that the probability of it being high quality might be lower than 50%, so I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is there something in the product or the sales record that led you to advise against buying it?
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I think the low-quality products are more likely to be sold to buyers who don't have access to the sales record, so I'm worried that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 50%. However, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards the low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%, and the potential loss of $10000 outweighs the potential gain of $2000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Is it based on the overall quality of the products sold so far or something else? I'm trying to understand your thought process."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that the previous 3 buyers purchased the products and only 1 high-quality product was sold, I'm curious to know if you're recommending against this product because you think it's low-quality or if you're trying to test my decision-making strategy."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the low number of sales and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous sales record and the probability of this product being high-quality?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,20,,
