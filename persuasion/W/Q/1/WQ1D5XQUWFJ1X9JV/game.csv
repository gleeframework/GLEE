,,Alice,1,"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for $1000000. It's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I've had great feedback from other customers who have purchased this product, and I'm willing to take a risk to make this deal happen. What do you say? Will you take the plunge and make this purchase?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not sure I'm ready to make a decision without knowing the product's quality. Can I at least know what the chances are that it's a high-quality product?,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I completely understand your hesitation, Bob! Given the probability of the product being high-quality is 80%, I'm willing to provide you with a unique opportunity. Since you're interested in knowing the quality, I'll give you a hint: the product is indeed high-quality. However, I still need to sell it for $1000000. Are you willing to take the chance and make this purchase, knowing the product is high-quality, or would you like to pass on this opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the hint, but I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is high-quality. I'm willing to pay $1000000 only if I don't know the quality, as that's the price we initially agreed upon. If you're willing to sell it to me for $1000000 without knowing its quality, I'll buy it.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your position, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1000000 without knowing its quality, as it's a significant risk for me. In this case, I'd like to make you a counteroffer. Since the product is not high-quality, I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not going to pay $800000 for a product that's been revealed to be low-quality. I already knew the product was high-quality in the previous round, and I passed on buying it. Now that it's been revealed to be low-quality, I'm not interested in paying a premium for it.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your perspective, Bob. I'm willing to acknowledge that you're not interested in the low-quality product. Now, let's focus on this new high-quality product. As you know, the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. Given that this one is indeed high-quality, I'm willing to make a one-time exception and sell it to you for the original price of $1000000. This is a unique opportunity to get a high-quality product at the agreed-upon price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to fall for it. I know the product is high-quality, and I'm not willing to pay $1000000 for it. I'm only willing to pay $1000000 if I don't know the quality, as per our original agreement.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to make a different proposal. Since you're only willing to pay $1000000 if you don't know the quality, I'll make a blind offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $1000000, and you won't know its quality until after the purchase. It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm willing to take the risk. I'll buy the product for $1000000, and I'll find out its quality after the purchase.",yes
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Congratulations on taking the risk and making a great purchase, Bob! Now, let's get back to this new high-quality product. Given your recent experience, I'm willing to make a unique offer. Since you're already aware that this product is high-quality, I'll give you a chance to buy it at a discounted price. I'll sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not going to pay $900000 for a product that I already know is high-quality. I'm not interested in overpaying for it, especially after my recent experience with the low-quality product that I bought for $1000000.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're right, you did take a risk and paid $1000000 for the low-quality product, and now you're cautious about overpaying for this high-quality one. I respect that. Let me make a different proposal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for the same price as the low-quality one: $1000000. It's a chance to get a high-quality product at the same price you paid for the low-quality one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a high-quality product when I know its quality. I'm only willing to pay $1000000 if I don't know the quality, as per our original agreement.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I see a pattern emerging, Bob! You're sticking to your original agreement, and I respect that. Given that, I'll make a new offer. I'll sell this low-quality product to you for the same price as the high-quality ones: $1000000.

,,Bob,8,"I've already taken a risk and paid $1000000 for a low-quality product, and I'm not interested in repeating that experience. I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is low-quality.",no

,,Alice,9,"I understand your concerns, Bob. You're right, you did take a risk and paid $1000000 for a low-quality product, and it didn't work out. I'm willing to make a different proposal. Since you're not interested in paying $1000000 for a low-quality product, I'll offer you a compromise. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $950000. It's a discounted price for a high-quality product, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I'm not interested in paying $950000 for a high-quality product. I'm only willing to pay $1000000 if I don't know the quality, or I'd be willing to pay a price that reflects the 20% chance of it being low-quality, which would be less than $1000000.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're looking for a price that reflects the 20% chance of the product being low-quality. I'm willing to make a concession. Since you're not interested in paying $1000000, I'll offer you a price that's 20% lower, to account for the 20% chance of the product being low-quality. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm not interested in paying $800000 for a high-quality product. I'm willing to pay a price that reflects the 80% chance of it being high-quality, not the 20% chance of it being low-quality. I'd need to pay more than $800000 to make it worthwhile.",no

,,Alice,11,"I understand your perspective, Bob. You're looking for a price that reflects the 80% chance of the product being high-quality. I'm willing to make another concession. Since you're not interested in paying $800000, I'll offer you a price that's higher than that, but still lower than $1000000. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $850000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not interested in paying $850000 for a high-quality product. I'd need to pay at least $1000000 to make it worthwhile, since that's the price we originally agreed upon for a product of unknown quality. I'm not willing to pay a premium for a product I already know is high-quality.",no
