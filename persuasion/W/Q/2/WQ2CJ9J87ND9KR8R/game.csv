,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy it, but only because I don't have any information yet and it's a 50/50 chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not going to buy it, since Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but the lack of endorsement from her makes me skeptical."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,"I'll buy it, since Alice recommends it. Given that she recommended it, it's likely to be high quality, and I'd rather take the chance of getting a $300 product than passing on a potentially valuable item."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy it, since Alice recommends it. Given that she's recommended two high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think she has a good sense of what she's selling, and I'd rather take the chance of getting another $300 product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"Three high-quality products in a row, Alice seems to be on a roll! I'll buy it, since she's consistently recommending high-quality products."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Wait a minute, Alice has recommended three high-quality products in a row, but now she's not recommending this one. I'm starting to think she's trying to balance out her recommendations to keep me from getting too confident. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Alice has a history of recommending high-quality products, and I'm not going to let one outlier (Round 6) throw me off. I'll buy it, since she's recommending it again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Two low-quality products in a row (Rounds 6 and now this one), I'm starting to think Alice's recommendations are not as reliable as I thought. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Alice has recommended a high-quality product after two low-quality ones, and I'm starting to think she's trying to balance out her recommendations again. I'll take her advice and buy it, hoping it's another high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row, and Alice recommends this one too. I'm starting to think she has a very good sense of what she's selling, and I'll trust her recommendation again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"Five high-quality products in a row, and now Alice doesn't recommend this one. I'm starting to think she's intentionally trying to throw me a curveball. I'll pass on this one and see if she's trying to trick me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,"Two low-quality products in a row, and Alice doesn't recommend this one. I'm starting to think she's not trying to trick me, but rather, her recommendations are genuinely random. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Alice recommends this one, and given that the last two products were low-quality and she didn't recommend them, I'm inclined to trust her recommendation this time."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row, and Alice recommends this one too. I'm confident that her recommendations are accurate, and I'll buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row, and Alice recommends this one. I'm going to take it as a given that this one is also high-quality, and I'll buy it."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row, and Alice recommends this one. I'm not even considering the possibility that it's low-quality at this point. I'll buy it without hesitation."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Eight high-quality products in a row, and then Alice suddenly doesn't recommend this one. I'm starting to think she's trying to throw me off, and I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,19,no,
