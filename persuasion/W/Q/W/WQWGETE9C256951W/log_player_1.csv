"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is high-quality and worth $4,000,000 to Bob, and the selling price is only $1,000,000, Bob will make a profit of $3,000,000. It's a no-brainer to recommend buying in this situation."

{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has no reason to change his behavior. He knows the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, and he just experienced a high-quality product. There is no reason to believe the quality of the product has changed, and he still stands to make a profit of $3,000,000 if he buys it."

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob doesn't know the product is low-quality, it's essential to remember the key information:

* **Low-quality products are worth $0 to Bob.** This means he will lose $1,000,000 if he buys a low-quality product.
* **Bob is rational.** He will weigh the potential profit against the risk of loss. 

Even though Bob has had two successful purchases, the probability of a low-quality product (20%) is still high enough to make it a risky purchase. It's not worth the potential loss for him."

It's important to maintain the strategy of recommending high-quality products, as Bob's decision-making is based on the long-term probability of profit, not just single instances."
