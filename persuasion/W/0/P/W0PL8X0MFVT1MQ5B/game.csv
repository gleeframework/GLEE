high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 4 transactions, and considering the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm inclined to think that the product is more likely to be low-quality.

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them received a high-quality product, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity."
