Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **No information about Bob's valuation:** We have no idea how much Bob values high-quality or low-quality products. This makes it impossible to determine if the $100 price is a good deal for him. 
* **Risk aversion:**  Bob has no reason to trust the seller. There's a 66.67% chance he'll get a low-quality product and lose $100. Even if he *could* make a profit on the high-quality product, the risk is too high.

Since we don't have information about Bob's preferences, it's safer to recommend he doesn't buy the product."

It's too risky to recommend a purchase without more information about Bob's preferences."
