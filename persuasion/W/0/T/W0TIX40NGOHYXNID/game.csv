,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 products sold, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
