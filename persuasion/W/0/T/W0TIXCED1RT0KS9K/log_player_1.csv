Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your cautious approach. We'd like to offer a different perspective: even if the 100% success rate isn't representative of the overall quality of our products, it's clear that our high-quality products are consistently high-quality. And since you're considering buying from us, you're already taking a chance on our brand. Why not take a chance on a product that's already proven to be high-quality?

Would you like to take a chance on our next high-quality product, which has an 80% chance of being high-quality?""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to decline the current product based on the current statistics. With only 2 out of 4 products sold being high-quality, the sample size is indeed small, and I'm not convinced that the 50% probability of a high-quality product is representative of the overall 80% probability.
