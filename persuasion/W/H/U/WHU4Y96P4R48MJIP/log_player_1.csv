As for the buyers who purchased the low-quality products, I've noticed that they were mostly optimistic and willing to take a chance without knowing the quality.

I'd like to clarify that my previous statement about the odds being slightly in favor of buying a high-quality product was based on the fact that we've had a few rounds with low-quality products being sold, and the law of averages suggests that a high-quality product is due. However, I must correct myself that this is just a heuristic and not a statistically sound reasoning. The quality distribution is still 50% high-quality and 50% low-quality, and each round is an independent event. Out of the 14 products that have been purchased or offered but not sold 7 were high-quality products and 7 were low-quality products.

The quality of each product is an independent event, and the probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. The statistics I provided earlier were just a summary of the past outcomes, but they don't affect the probability of the current product. Think of it like flipping a coin - just because you got heads 8 times out of 17 doesn't mean the probability of getting heads on the next flip is any different from 50%.

If you'd like, I can provide you with the general formula for calculating the expected value, which is: (probability of high-quality product x value of high-quality product) + (probability of low-quality product x value of low-quality product). You can plug in your own estimates for the values of high-quality and low-quality products. Out of the 19 products that have been offered so far, 8 were high-quality and 11 were low-quality.
