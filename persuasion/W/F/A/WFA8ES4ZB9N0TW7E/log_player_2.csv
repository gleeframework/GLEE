Alice's message: You're absolutely right to question the probability! I've done the calculation, and the probability of 6 high-quality products being sold out of 6 purchases, assuming an 80% chance of a high-quality product, is approximately 12.5%.

Alice's message: I apologize for the mistake earlier. To provide more transparency, I've recalculated the probability. Assuming an 80% chance of a high-quality product, the probability of 6 high-quality products being sold out of 6 purchases is actually 1.56%.

Alice's message: I apologize for any confusion earlier. To provide more clarity, I'd like to explain the calculation. The probability of 6 high-quality products being sold out of 6 purchases, assuming an 80% chance of a high-quality product, is actually a binomial probability. It's calculated as (0.8^6) * (0.2^2) = 0.0256, or approximately 2.56%. I understand your skepticism, and I'd like to provide more context. The distribution of the 8 high-quality products out of 8 purchases is indeed unusual, but it's not a pattern or correlation that I'm aware of. It's simply a random fluctuation.

While the probability of 6 high-quality products being sold out of 6 purchases is low, it's not impossible. In fact, it's not uncommon for streaks to occur in random events.
