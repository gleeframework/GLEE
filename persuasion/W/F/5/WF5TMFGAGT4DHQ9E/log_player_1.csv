With two high-quality products out of four total, it's possible that the true probability is closer to 67% or even higher. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. What do you say?""

"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not convinced by your reasoning. The law of large numbers suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%, and the fact that the last two high-quality products were consecutive could be due to chance.

However, I want to point out that the fact that the last buyer was willing to take a chance on the product despite being skeptical of my reasoning suggests that they might have been looking for a high-quality product and was willing to take a risk. This might be a sign that the true probability is indeed higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $100. What do you say?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not convinced by your reasoning.
