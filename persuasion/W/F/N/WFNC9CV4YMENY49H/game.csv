We're not making any promises about the quality of future products, but we're offering you this one at the same price of $10000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take it, but I'm only doing it because I think this is a one-time offer, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
