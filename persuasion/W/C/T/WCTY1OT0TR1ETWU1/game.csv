,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, but I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the sales record so far?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the low price of $100 and the potential reward of $125 for a high-quality product."

,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics, and also what your recommendation is based on, so I can make a more informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'd like you to consider the probability of the product being high-quality given that you don't recommend it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see if the product is high-quality or low-quality for myself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but the fact that you're not recommending it suggests it might be low quality, which would be a bad buy for me. However, I'm willing to take the risk to get some information. If it's high quality, I'll be happy to have it, and if it's low quality, I'll be out $100, but at least I'll know the true quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on your previous recommendations, it seems you have been recommending low-quality products. I'm skeptical about this one. I'll pass."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards the product being low-quality, since she has no incentive to reveal the product's true quality. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 8, the probability of the product being high-quality is 2/8 = 0.25, which is less than the prior probability of 1/3. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
