Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your diligence. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to mislead you. The 0% high-quality rate is a fact, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it. However, I'd like to point out that you're not getting any information about the quality of the product. You're making an assumption based on my sales record, but what if I'm just getting started and haven't had a chance to sell any high-quality products yet?

Alice's message: I understand you're risk-averse, and I respect that. I'd like to offer you a different perspective. Think about it this way: if I were selling a product that was guaranteed to be high-quality, I would have sold it by now. The fact that I haven't sold any high-quality products yet suggests that I might be selling low-quality products, but it also suggests that I'm being transparent and honest about my sales record.
