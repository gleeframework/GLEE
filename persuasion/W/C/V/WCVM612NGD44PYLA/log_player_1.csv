}"
"Bob's message: I'll take the offer and buy the product. But I'm only doing this because of the guarantee, and I expect the product to be high-quality. If it turns out to be low-quality, I'll be very disappointed!

Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're satisfied with the first product! Since you've already taken advantage of the guarantee in the first round, I'll offer you a new product without any guarantees. However, I'll provide you with some additional information: I've sold 5 high-quality products so far, and only 1 low-quality product. This is all the information I can share with you. The price remains the same: $100. What do you think?""
}"

Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80%, but the odds are slightly less favorable now. The price remains the same: $100. What are your thoughts?""
}"
"Bob's message: I'm not too concerned about the slightly less favorable odds. With a 4:2 ratio, the probability of a product being high-quality is still 66.67%, which is higher than the overall average probability of 80%. I'll take the product.
