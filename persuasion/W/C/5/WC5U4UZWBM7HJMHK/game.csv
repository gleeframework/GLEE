,,Alice,2,"I'm offering you another high-quality product, worth $12000, for $10000. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and you'll never see it again. Given the previous sale, I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount on this one, making it a one-time offer. If you don't take it now, I'll go back to the original price.",
,,Bob,2,I'll take the product with the 10% discount,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm offering you a product that I'm confident will be worth at least $5000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is a 50% discount. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and you'll never see it again. I'm not making any promises about its quality, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a product at a very low price.",
,,Bob,3,"I'll pass, I'm not interested in a product with unknown quality at this price",no
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You passed on the previous offer, but I think you're a savvy buyer and will appreciate this one. I'm offering you a high-quality product, worth $12000, for $10000. This one is a 'guaranteed' high-quality product, just like the previous two. If you buy it, you'll get a high-quality product. If you don't buy it, I'll keep it and you'll never see it again. I'm confident you won't regret this decision.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product, I'm willing to trust your guarantee",yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You've shown great judgment in trusting my guarantee on the previous product. I'm offering you another high-quality product, worth $12000, for $10000. This one is also a 'guaranteed' high-quality product. I'm willing to make a side bet with you: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you another product of your choice (at the same price) on the next round. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'll take the product and accept your side bet,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"You've made a great decision again! With your track record, I'm confident you'll appreciate this next offer. I'm offering you another high-quality product, worth $12000, for $10000. This one is also a 'guaranteed' high-quality product. However, considering your willingness to take on the side bet last round, I'm willing to offer you a unique opportunity: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to 'pass' on the next two products, and you can wait for the next one. If you choose to pass, I'll keep those two products and you'll get the next one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,6,I'll take the product and accept the option to pass on the next two,yes
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"You've taken advantage of the option to pass on the next two products. I'm glad you're confident in my guarantees! As promised, I'll keep the next two products and we'll move on to the next one. Here's the situation: you've bought four high-quality products for $10000 each, and you've passed on two unknown-quality products. I'm now offering you another high-quality product, worth $12000, for $10000. However, considering your track record and the fact that you've already taken advantage of the option to pass on the next two, I'm willing to make a final offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 'golden ticket' that guarantees you get the next three products you see, regardless of quality, for the price of $10000 each. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,I'll take the product and accept the golden ticket,yes

,,Alice,8,"You've taken the golden ticket! Congratulations, you've secured a great deal. Now, let's talk about the current product. I know you've got a golden ticket, but I want to make it worth your while to consider this one. With the golden ticket, you'll get the next three products for $10000 each, regardless of quality. If you buy this one, I'll give you a 'free upgrade' to a high-quality product on the next round, which would normally be worth $12000. However, if you don't buy this one, the free upgrade will be void, and you'll have to rely on the golden ticket. What do you think?",

,,Alice,9,"You've taken the product and kept the golden ticket. Now, let's talk about the current product. I know you've got a golden ticket, which guarantees you three more products at $10000 each, regardless of quality. Considering this, I'm willing to make a 'no-strings-attached' offer: I'll give you the free upgrade to a high-quality product on the next round, regardless of whether you buy this one or not. If you buy this one, you'll get the free upgrade, and the golden ticket will still be valid. If you don't buy this one, the free upgrade will still be yours on the next round. What do you think?",

,,Alice,10,"You've chosen to pass on this one and take the free upgrade on the next round. I respect your decision. Now, let's talk about the current product. I know you've got the free upgrade coming up, but I'm offering you another high-quality product, worth $12000, for $10000. This one is a 'bonus' product, and if you buy it, you'll get to enjoy it immediately, in addition to the free upgrade on the next round. Think of it as a 'preview' of the high-quality products you'll get soon. What do you think?",

Considering this, I'm willing to make a 'last-chance' offer: I'll give you a'steal' of a deal on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5000, which is 50% off the usual price of $10000. You can think of it as a 'loss leader' to get you to the next round, where you'll get the free upgrade. What do you think?",
