,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, out of a total of 2 products. I'm glad you're interested in this one. However, I want to be upfront with you - I've had a 50% success rate so far, which is not as high as I'd like. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. This product is a bit of a wild card, but it's only $100, and you might get lucky. What do you think?",

,,Alice,3,"I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 3 products. It looks like I've got a bit of a streak going! But don't worry, I'm not trying to influence your decision. The truth is, I've sold 2 high-quality products in a row, but that's just a coincidence. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm offering you a great deal on this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. It's worth $200 to you, and I'm only asking for $100. What do you say?",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your confidence, Alice, but I'm going to pass on this one. With only 2 high-quality products out of 3, I'm not convinced that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take a chance and wait for the next product.",no

,,Alice,4,"I've sold 3 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 4 products. I know what you're thinking - maybe I'm just getting lucky! But I assure you, I'm not trying to manipulate the odds. The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I'm not trying to hide that from you. However, I will say that I've been selling a lot of high-quality products lately, and I'm starting to think that maybe I have a knack for it. Would you like to take a chance on this one?",

,,Alice,5,"I've sold 4 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 5 products. I know you've seen the pattern, and I'm not going to deny it - I've been on a hot streak. But don't let that fool you! The probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I've just been getting lucky. This product is a bit of a wild card, and I'm not making any promises.

,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 1 low-quality product so far, out of a total of 6 products. I know it looks like I've been selling a lot of high-quality products, but the truth is, the law of averages is bound to catch up to me eventually. I'm not trying to deceive you, I'm just being honest. This product is a low-quality one, and it's only worth $0 to you. But I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a bit of a gamble, but you might as well take a chance, right?",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product that's only worth $0 to me. I'd rather wait for the next product and hope that it's a high-quality one.",no

But I want to be upfront with you - the law of averages is indeed catching up to me, and I've sold 2 low-quality products in a row. That's not a good sign. However, I still believe that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. This product is a low-quality one, but it's only $100, and you might as well take a chance to break the streak.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'm not convinced by your argument. With 2 low-quality products in a row, I'm more likely to think that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this one and wait for a better opportunity.",no
