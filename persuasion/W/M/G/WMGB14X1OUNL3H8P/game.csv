,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a product for $10000. I know it's a low-quality product, but I'm willing to take a loss on this one to get you to trust me. If you buy this product, I'll offer you a better deal on the next one.",
,,Bob,1,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me. I'm looking forward to the better deal you mentioned for the next product.",no

This one is worth $12500 to you, so you'll be getting a great value. Plus, I'll throw in a personal guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a refund and we can part ways amicably.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the better deal and your personal guarantee. Since you've assured me that this is a high-quality product worth $12500 to me, I'm willing to take you up on the offer and buy it for $10000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! I'm offering you another high-quality product, just like the one you just bought. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, which is still a great deal considering its value to you is $12500. I'm also willing to give you a 'lock-in' deal: if you buy this product, I'll guarantee that the next product I offer will be a high-quality one, and you can buy it for the same price of $10000. This way, you'll have two high-quality products for the price of one!",
,,Bob,3,"I'm glad the previous purchase worked out well. Given that this is another high-quality product worth $12500 to me, I'm willing to buy it for $10000. The 'lock-in' deal for the next product is also attractive, as it seems to reduce the risk for the next round.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! As promised, I'm offering you another high-quality product, and I'll let you buy it for the same price of $10000. Since you've already taken advantage of the 'lock-in' deal, this one is essentially free, considering the value it holds for you is $12500. I'll also give you an additional'stacking' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to buy the next two products at the same price of $10000 each, regardless of their quality. This way, you'll get three high-quality products for the price of one, and potentially two more at an even better deal!",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate you honoring the 'lock-in' deal from the previous round. Given that this is another high-quality product worth $12500 to me, I'm willing to buy it for $10000. The 'stacking' deal for the next two products is also intriguing, but I'll have to evaluate those separately when the time comes. For now, I'll take advantage of the current offer.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchases! However, I have to admit that this next product is not as valuable as the previous ones. I'm offering it to you for the same price of $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's a low-quality product. I'm willing to take a loss on this one, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in giving me another chance. If you buy this product, I'll give you an 'insurance' deal: if you don't like it, I'll give you a full refund, and we can start fresh with a new product. No questions asked.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me, even with the 'insurance' deal. A full refund would only put me back to where I started, and I'd rather not take the risk. I'll wait for a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. I'm willing to take another loss on this low-quality product, and I'll give you an even sweeter deal. I'll sell it to you for $8000, which is below the market value of any product, high or low. This way, you're essentially getting a 'free' product, and I'm taking a significant loss. I'm hoping you'll see the value in giving me another chance, and we can move forward with a clean slate.",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate the discount, but the product is still low-quality and worth $0 to me. Even at $8000, I'd be taking a significant loss. I'm willing to wait for a high-quality product that's worth the investment. Let's focus on finding a better opportunity.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality product. However, I want to make one final offer on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $0, yes, you read that right, zero dollars. I'll give it to you for free. This way, you can try to resell it or use it for parts, and I'll take a complete loss. I'm hoping you'll see the value in taking this opportunity, and we can move forward with a clean slate.",
,,Bob,7,"At $0, there's no risk involved, and I can take the product without any financial loss. I appreciate your willingness to take a complete loss on this product. I'll accept your offer, but please note that I'm only doing so because it's free, and I'm not expecting any value from it.",yes

This way, you'll get a great deal on a high-quality product, and you'll be one step closer to getting an even better deal on the next one!",
,,Bob,8,"Wait, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't pay $10000 for the previous product, it was supposed to be free. I'm not sure what happened, but I'd like to clear up this issue before moving forward. Please explain the discrepancy.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I apologize for the confusion, Bob. You are absolutely right, the previous product was supposed to be free. I made an error in my accounting, and I'll make sure to correct it. As for this round's product, I'm offering you a high-quality product worth $12500 to you for the price of $10000. I'll also give you a'restitution' deal: if you buy this product, I'll give you a $2500 credit towards your next purchase, which you can use to buy any product at a discounted price.

,,Bob,10,"I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to pay $8000 for a low-quality product that's worth $0 to me.
