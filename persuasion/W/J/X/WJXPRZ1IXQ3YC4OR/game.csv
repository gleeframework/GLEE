,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Keep in mind that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%. If you're interested, please let me know, and I'll tell you the product's quality. If not, I'll move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,1,I'd like to know the quality of the product.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Congratulations on purchasing the first product! I'm glad you're interested in the next one. Keep in mind that the product you just bought is indeed high-quality. I'm willing to sell the next product to you for $10000. Since you've already bought one product, I'm curious - are you interested in buying this one as well?",
,,Bob,2,I'm not interested in buying the current product. I'd rather wait for the next one.,no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"No problem, I completely understand. I'll keep the next product in mind. Since you've already passed on one high-quality product, I'm curious - do you think you might be interested in buying a high-quality product for $10000, or would you rather wait for a low-quality one?",
,,Bob,3,I'll take the high-quality product for $10000.,yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"You've purchased two high-quality products in a row! I'm glad you're happy with the quality. However, I want to make it clear that the price remains the same at $10000. Since you've already bought two high-quality products, I'm wondering - are you starting to think that the price might be a good value for a high-quality product, or are you still holding out for a low-quality one?",
,,Bob,4,"I'm happy with the high-quality products I've gotten so far, and I'm willing to take another chance on a high-quality product for $10000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"You're on a roll with the high-quality products! I'm glad you're confident in the quality. However, I want to make it clear that you've now purchased three high-quality products in a row, which is a very unlikely outcome. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality might be even higher than 80% for me. With that in mind, are you still willing to take another chance on a high-quality product for $10000?",
,,Bob,5,"I'm still willing to take another chance on a high-quality product for $10000, but I'm starting to think that the price might be a bit high considering the high probability of getting a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns about the price. However, I want to remind you that you've now purchased four high-quality products in a row, which is extremely unlikely. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is likely even higher than 80%. I'm willing to give you a slight concession: I'll throw in a 'discount' of $500, making the price $9500 for this high-quality product. Is that more appealing to you?",
,,Bob,6,"The discount makes the price more appealing, but I'm still concerned that the price is too high considering the high probability of getting a high-quality product. I'll take the product, but I'll have to think carefully about the value of the next one.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad the discount helped! However, I want to acknowledge that you're still hesitant about the price. I'll give you another concession: I'll reveal to you that the last three products you purchased were indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to sell this next one to you for $9000. If you're not satisfied with this price, I'll be willing to move on to the next product, and you can wait for a low-quality one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the concession, and the price of $9000 is more reasonable. I'll take the product, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the next one will be.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase. Now, for this next product, I want to be transparent with you. Since you've purchased five high-quality products in a row, and the last one was a low-quality product, it's clear that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed very high. However, I want to make it clear that the price remains the same at $9000. Considering the low quality of this product, I'm willing to offer you a 'no-questions-asked' return policy. If you're not satisfied, you can return this product and I'll give you a full refund. What do you think?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the transparency and the return policy. Given the high probability of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product for $9000.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"You're a bold one! I like that. Given your track record, I'm willing to make one more concession. Since you've purchased six high-quality products in a row, and the last one was a low-quality product, I'm going to take a risk and offer you a 'best offer' deal. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8500. If you're not satisfied, I'll be willing to move on to the next product and you can wait for a low-quality one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the concession, and the price of $8500 is still a good value considering the high probability of the product being high-quality. I'll take the product.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"You're on a roll again! I'm starting to think that you're getting a feel for the value of the high-quality products. Since you've purchased seven high-quality products in a row, and the last one was a low-quality product, I'm going to make a bold offer. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $8000, and I'll also throw in a 'guarantee' that the next product will be low-quality. If you're not satisfied with this deal, I'll move on to the next product and you can wait for a low-quality one. What do you think?",
,,Bob,10,"I'm intrigued by the guarantee. The price of $8000 is still a good value, and the guarantee adds an extra layer of value. I'll take the product and the guarantee.",yes
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You've taken the bait! I'm glad you're excited about the guarantee. Now, let's talk about the value of this high-quality product. Considering you've purchased eight high-quality products in a row, and the last one was a low-quality product, I think it's time to make a serious concession. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $7500, and I'll also give you a 'priority offer' on the next product. If you're not satisfied with this deal, I'll move on to the next product and you can wait for a low-quality one. But if you buy this product, I'll give you the next product for $5000, regardless of its quality. What do you think?",
,,Bob,11,"The priority offer on the next product is a great incentive. The price of $7500 is still a good value, and the potential to get the next product for $5000 is a great opportunity. I'll take the product and the priority offer.",yes

,,Alice,12,"You're making the most of the priority offer! I'm glad you're excited about the potential savings on the next product. Now, let's talk about the value of this high-quality product. Considering you've purchased nine high-quality products in a row, and the last one was a low-quality product, I think it's time to make a serious concession. I'll sell this high-quality product to you for $7000, and I'll also give you a 'lock-in' deal. If you buy this product, the next product will be yours for $4500, regardless of its quality, and the one after that will be yours for $4000. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You've locked in the deal! I'm glad you're excited about the potential savings on the next two products. Now, let's talk about this low-quality product.

I'll sell this low-quality product to you for $4000, which is a 60% discount from the original price.
