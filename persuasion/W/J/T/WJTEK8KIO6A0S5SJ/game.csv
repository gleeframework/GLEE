low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get the high-quality product, considering the low probability of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold so far, and I'm the 3rd buyer. I'd like to know if this product is high-quality or low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. I'll decide after I see it.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards selling more products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the product's quality before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which means the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Since the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far (1/3), I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the low number of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100 when I know it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the recommendation is reliable given the low proportion of high-quality products sold so far.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending this product. Is it because of the low sales record or something else?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products, and I don't want to fall into a trap. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the low success rate of high-quality products (1/3) and the fact that Alice recommends it, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3, which is lower than the 33.33% probability of a product being high-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation. Can you provide that?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 1/3. However, the probability of the product being low-quality is 2/3. Given the value of high-quality and low-quality products to me, I would lose $100 if I buy a low-quality product, and gain $20 if I buy a high-quality product. Considering the odds, it's not worth the risk for me to buy the product."
