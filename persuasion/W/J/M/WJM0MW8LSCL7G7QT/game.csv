I'll sell it to you for $1000, which is a very low price considering its original value. I'll also include a 'as-is' warranty, which means you'll get it at a price that's essentially a scratch-and-dent sale. If you're looking for a cheap option, this might be the way to go. Would you like to take a look?",
