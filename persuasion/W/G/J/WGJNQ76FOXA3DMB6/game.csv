,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is based on the quality of the product, but rather on the fact that I'm the third buyer.

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of its quality, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product.
