low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no prior information to go on, and your recommendation carries no weight in my decision. I'm making an uninformed decision based on the lack of information."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to see more data on the previous buyer's decision before making a purchase decision.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and don't want to let it go to waste."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, given that the previous 3 buyers were advised against it, which might indicate a higher likelihood of a high-quality product being available."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the product and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one. I'm hoping that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it might be a low-quality product, which would be a good value for me."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that 5 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for the next product to be offered."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 5, which is very low. I'm skeptical about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is against it, so I'm trying to go against the odds and hope it's a high-quality product."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 previous buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I suspect that the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it seems that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 6 buyers were recommended to buy, it suggests that the products sold so far are likely to be low quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass. Can you give me more information about the previous sales?"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that 6 out of 6 previous products were low-quality. I'd like to wait for a more favorable recommendation."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on past data. With 6 buyers and no high-quality products sold, it's possible that the remaining products are all low quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see what happens with the next buyer."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 6 buyers have already purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations. The fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is any better.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6 purchases, I'm inclined to think that the products sold so far are likely low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if you can provide more information or a better recommendation."
