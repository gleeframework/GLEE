,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk because I think the probability of it being high quality is still 50% and I can get a $30000 product for $10000. I'd like to know the outcome of my purchase."

,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality seems low. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that all previous buyers were discouraged by her and didn't buy the product, which might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or try to negotiate a lower price."

,,Alice,16,yes,

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the fact that Alice's previous recommendations are all 'no', which implies that all 5 previous products were low-quality.

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards selling low-quality products, so I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think you're trying to discourage me from buying, which makes me suspicious. I'm willing to take the risk."
