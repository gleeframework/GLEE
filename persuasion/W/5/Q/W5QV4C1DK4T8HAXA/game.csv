high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in more information. The product I have now is indeed a high-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. However, I want to make it clear that this is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a relatively low price. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else for a higher price, and you might not get another chance to get a high-quality product at this price point.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you made a great decision on the previous product! Now, I want to be transparent with you. As you know, the first product was low-quality, and you wisely decided not to buy it. I'm offering this new product for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that the probability of it being high-quality is the same as before, 50%. However, considering the previous product was low-quality, I'm willing to offer you a 'discount' of $200000, making the price $800000 for this product.",

This product, unfortunately, is also low-quality. I'm not willing to offer any discounts this time. I'm still offering it to you for $1000000. I want to make it clear that I'm confident that the next product will be high-quality, and I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount on it if you pass on this one.",
,,Bob,4,"Given the lack of a discount and the history of low-quality products, I prefer to wait for the next opportunity.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,5,,

Considering your patience, I'm willing to offer you a 15% discount on this product, making the price $850000. I believe this is a great value, especially considering the high-quality of the product and the fact that you've already seen two low-quality products in a row. I'm confident that this is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a great price.",

However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to offer you an even better deal this time. I'm willing to offer you a 20% discount, making the price $800000. But that's not all - I'm also willing to give you a 'guarantee' that if the next product is low-quality, I'll give you an additional 10% discount on it, making the price $900000. This way, you'll have a chance to get a great deal on the next product as well.",

However, I'm also willing to give you a 'buyout option' - if you buy this product, I'll give you the option to buy the next two products at the price of $700000 each, regardless of their quality. This way, you'll have a chance to get two more high-quality products at an incredible price, or potentially get a great deal on two low-quality products.",
