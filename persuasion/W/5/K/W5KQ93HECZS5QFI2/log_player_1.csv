"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has revealed the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 50%, he knows this product is definitely below average value. There's no reason for Bob to buy a low-quality product at the fixed price of $10,000 when he could potentially get a high-quality product for the same price in the future."
"Bob's message: Thank you for your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The same logic applies as in Round 1.  Alice has revealed the product is low-quality. Even though Bob didn't buy the product in Round 1, he knows the odds of getting a high-quality product are 50/50. There's no reason for him to buy a known low-quality product when he could potentially get a better deal in the future."
"Bob's message: I appreciate the advice, Alice. I'll pass on this opportunity as well.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same.  Alice has revealed the product is low-quality, and Bob knows the probability of high-quality is 50%.  He's already passed on two low-quality products. There's no reason for him to change his strategy now."
"Bob's message: Thanks for letting me know, Alice. I'll continue to pass on these recommendations.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues. Alice continues to reveal low-quality products, and Bob, aware of the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product, is perfectly justified in continuing to pass on these offers. There is no new information for Bob to act on, and the odds of a high-quality product appearing in the future remain the same."
"Bob's message: I'm glad you're not recommending this product, Alice. I'll keep looking elsewhere.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time Alice has revealed a high-quality product. While Bob has no way of knowing this is a one-off or if Alice is changing her strategy, he should take advantage of the opportunity. 

The odds are in his favor. Even if this is just a fluke and the rest of the products will be low-quality, he still has a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product at a fixed price.  Since he doesn't know how much a high-quality product is worth to him, he should take the gamble."
"Bob's message: Given your recommendation, Alice, I think I'll take a chance on this product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob just bought a high-quality product, there's no guarantee that the next product will be low-quality.  The probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.  Bob should continue to buy every time Alice recommends a product since he doesn't know the value of the high-quality product to him. If it's worth more than $10,000, he's getting a great deal, and if it's worth less, he's still taking a 50/50 gamble on a potential good deal."
"Bob's message: With your recommendation, Alice, I feel confident in making this purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 7
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite having bought two high-quality products in a row, the information about the current product being low-quality changes the situation. Bob knows that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality.  Since Alice has revealed this one is low-quality, there's no reason for Bob to buy it. He should wait for the next product, which has a 50% chance of being high-quality."
"Bob's message: Even without your recommendation, Alice, I'll pass on this one based on previous outcomes.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 8
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to pass on the previous low-quality product is a good sign that he's starting to understand the pattern.  He's likely now waiting for a recommendation on a high-quality product. Since Alice has revealed this product is high-quality, Bob should buy it.  

Remember, Bob is still in the dark about the actual value of high-quality products to him. He should continue buying recommended products as long as he doesn't know this value."
"Bob's message: Your recommendation, Alice, has convinced me to take the risk on this product.
Bob bought the product!

Round 9
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has revealed that this product is low-quality.  While Bob bought the last two high-quality products, he knows that each product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. Since this one is low-quality, there's no reason for him to buy it.  He should wait for the next product, which could be high-quality."
"Bob's message: Despite your lack of recommendation, Alice, I've learned to trust my own judgment after recent successes.
Bob didn't bought the product.

Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's decision to pass on the last low-quality product shows he's understanding the pattern. He's likely waiting for a high-quality recommendation, and this is it.  Alice has revealed this product is high-quality.  

Since Bob still doesn't know the value of a high-quality product, he should continue to buy recommended products.  He's taking a 50/50 gamble, but it's a gamble worth taking since he doesn't know how much higher the value of the product could be."
"Bob's message: With your positive recommendation, Alice, I believe this is a good opportunity to make a purchase.
Bob bought the product!

Round 11

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been showing a good understanding of the game. He's buying recommended products and passing on non-recommended ones.  Since Alice has revealed this product is high-quality, Bob should buy it.  

Even though he's bought several high-quality products already, he still doesn't know the actual value of a high-quality product to him. As long as he doesn't have this knowledge, he should continue buying recommended products, taking advantage of the 50/50 chance of getting a good deal."
"Bob's message: Your endorsement, Alice, gives me confidence in this decision.
Bob bought the product!

He's also shown he's willing to pass on low-quality products. Since Alice has revealed this product is high-quality, Bob should continue to buy recommended products. He doesn't know the actual value of high-quality products to him, so he should take advantage of the 50% chance of getting a good deal with each purchase."
