``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** We only have one data point: one high-quality product sold. This isn't enough to establish a trend or trust in Alice's recommendations.
* **50/50 Odds:** The inherent 50/50 chance of a high-quality product means the risk is balanced.
* **Potential Profit:** Even with a 50% chance of getting a worthless product, the potential profit from a high-quality product ($1,250,000 - $1,000,000 = $250,000) is significant.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Passing on the product means missing out on the potential profit, and the product is discarded.

**Overall:** With the limited information available, it's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk."
