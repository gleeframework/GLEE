**Reasoning:**

Since the previous buyer purchased the product and it turned out to be high quality, there is a strong indication that Alice is likely recommending high-quality products. While the 33.33% chance of a low-quality product exists, the recommendation from Alice and the previous sale history makes the risk worth taking."

**Explanation:**

* **The odds are in your favor:**  Even though there's a higher chance of the product being low quality, the fact that Alice recommends buying it and 9 high-quality products were sold out of 9 purchases means the likelihood of this product being high quality is significantly increased.
* **Potential for high profit:**  If the product is high quality, you stand to make a $100 profit. This outweighs the risk of losing $100 if it turns out to be low quality.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is acting in a way that benefits her. By recommending the product, she likely believes it's high quality and wants to make the sale. However, there's no guarantee. It's still a gamble, but a calculated one with favorable odds based on the current information."
