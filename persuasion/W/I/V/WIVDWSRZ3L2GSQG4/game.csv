,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on, but I'll make a decision based on the probabilities."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products in the products that you've sold so far, and the proportion of products that you've recommended to buy."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know why you don't recommend it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 5 buyers have been offered the product, and none of them were high-quality. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for the next product or get more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this one.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm a rational buyer and I'll make my own decision based on the probability of the product being high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics, which suggest that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm going to buy the product and see if it's high quality or not."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm not sure what to make of the statistics, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that there have been no high-quality products sold so far, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 10 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than expected. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 10 out of 10 products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product, as the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I might get lucky!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the proportion of low-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product given the previous 11 sales. Can you tell me the number of high-quality products sold out of the 11?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the fact that 11 out of 11 previous buyers did not buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
