Alice's message: I understand your skepticism, and I'm happy to provide more context. The change in probability is due to the fact that we've sold a total of 10 products now, and the law of large numbers is starting to kick in. With 3 high-quality products out of 10, the probability of the next product being high-quality is indeed higher than our initial 33.33% rate.
