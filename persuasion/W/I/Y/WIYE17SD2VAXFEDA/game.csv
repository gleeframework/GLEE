high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,

Given the statistics, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. Since Alice has already sold one high-quality product out of one product sold, it's possible that the remaining products are more likely to be low-quality, making the expected value of buying the product negative. I'd like to pass on this opportunity and wait for more information."
