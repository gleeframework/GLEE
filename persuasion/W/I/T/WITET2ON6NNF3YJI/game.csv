,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"The probability of the product being high-quality is 50%, but based on your sales record, only 2 out of 6 products sold were high-quality, which is 33.33%. Given the product's value to me is $20000 for high-quality and $0 for low-quality, and considering the asking price is $10000, the expected value of buying the product is less than the asking price. Therefore, I choose not to buy."

,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"The probability of the product being high quality is 50%, but based on your sales record, only 2 out of 6 products sold were high quality. Given that the product's value to me is $0 if it's low quality and $20000 if it's high quality, and you're offering it for $10000, the expected value is not enough to justify the purchase, especially considering your recommendation might not be entirely reliable."
