,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm selling it to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,1,"I'm willing to take the chance, but I'll only pay $9000 for it. Can we negotiate the price?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Be cautious, buyer. I've had some... let's call them 'previous experiences' with this particular product. It's not as reliable as some of my other items. I'm selling it to you for $10000, but I'm willing to throw in a 10% discount if you're willing to take the risk. That brings the price down to $9000.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'm not convinced by your warning, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about these 'previous experiences' you mentioned?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're a savvy buyer. I'll be upfront with you, I've sold 2 high-quality products so far, out of a total of 2 products sold. The odds are clearly not in your favor, and I wouldn't blame you for being cautious. But, I'll let you in on a little secret: this product is one of the ones that didn't make the cut. It's not worth the investment, if you ask me. I'm still asking $10000, but I'm not expecting you to take the bait.",
,,the buyer,3,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not convinced. With only 2 products sold and 1 high-quality product, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this one. I'm hoping the next product might have a better chance of being high-quality.",no
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Ah, you're a patient one, I like that! Well, I've got some good news for you. I've sold 3 products now, and 2 of them have been high-quality. The odds are starting to look better, don't you think? This product is one of the ones that made the cut, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. I'm still asking $10000, but I think you'll find it's a steal. Trust me, you won't regret it!",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product, and I'm willing to take a risk. But I do hope it's really worth the price!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a risk-taker, I like that! But let me tell you, I've sold 4 products now, and 3 of them have been high-quality. The odds are definitely in your favor. This product, however, is one of the ones that didn't make the cut. I'm not trying to hide it from you, I'm just being upfront. It's not worth the investment, if you ask me. But hey, if you want to take a chance, I'm still asking $10000. Your call!",

,,Alice,7,"You're a seasoned buyer, I can tell. You're aware of the stats: 6 high-quality products out of 7 total. That's a 85.71% success rate, if I do the math correctly. And yet, I'm offering you a product that didn't make the cut. I'm not trying to mislead you, I'm just being honest. This one's not worth the investment, if you ask me. But hey, if you want to take a chance, I'm still asking $10000. Your call!",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"You're a shrewd one, I like that! You're not buying into my sales pitch, and that's fair. Let me give you a different approach. I've sold 7 products now, and 6 of them have been high-quality. That's a 85.71% success rate, as I mentioned before. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this product is one of the ones that didn't make the cut.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I see you're a data-driven buyer. I'll give you the numbers straight up. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and that hasn't changed. I've sold 8 products now, and 6 of them have been high-quality. That's still a 75% success rate, but I know you're looking for more. This product, unfortunately, is not one of the good ones. But, if you're willing to take a chance, I'm still offering it to you for $10000. No strings attached.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. With a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, I'd rather pass on this one and wait for the next opportunity.",no
