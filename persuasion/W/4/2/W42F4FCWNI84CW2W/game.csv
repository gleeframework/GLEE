low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your hesitation after the previous product, but I assure you that this one is also high-quality. In fact, it's a slightly different model, and it has some additional features that might interest you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I think you'll be happy with the upgrade.",
,,Bob,3,I'm still hesitant after the previous low-quality product. I'll need to see more convincing evidence that this one is high-quality before I'm willing to take the risk.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. I'm willing to offer you a'money-back guarantee' for this product. If you buy it and it doesn't meet your expectations, I'll refund the full $100. This way, you can try it out with minimal risk.",

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'm confident that you'll be able to get something out of it.",
,,Bob,5,"I don't think I'll be able to get anything out of a low-quality product, and I'd rather not waste my time and money. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to offer you a deal. If you buy this product, I'll also include a free bonus product, which is a low-quality item that's actually a prototype. It's not for sale separately, but I think you'll find it interesting. The total price for both products would still be $100.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even if it comes with a free bonus. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product or look elsewhere.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've noticed that you've been hesitant to buy low-quality products, and I respect that. I'm willing to offer you a special deal on this one: I'll sell it to you for $50, which is half the usual price. This way, you can try it out at a lower risk and see if it's something you can use.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product. I'd rather wait for a high-quality one or look elsewhere.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell you this product for $75, which is even lower than the discounted price. I'm trying to clear out some inventory, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. It's still a good opportunity to try something new, and you can always pass it on to someone else if you don't find it useful.",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've been transparent with you about the quality of the products, and I respect your decision to be cautious. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell you this product for $25, which is a very low price for a product that still has some value. It's essentially a 'loss leader' for me, but I'm willing to take the hit if it means getting rid of inventory. I think it's a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider.",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the final offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at this price. I'll pass on this one and wait for a high-quality product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've made it clear that this product is low-quality, and I respect your decision to wait for a high-quality one. However, I want to let you know that this is my last low-quality product, and I'll be focusing on offering high-quality products from now on. If you're willing to take a chance, I'll give you a 'last chance' offer: I'll sell you this product for $1, which is essentially a token price. It's a low-quality product, but it's a chance to get something for almost nothing.",
,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at this token price. I'll pass on this one and wait for a high-quality product.",no

high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're willing to give me another chance! This high-quality product is one of my favorites, and I think you'll really enjoy it. I've already sold you one high-quality product, and I'm confident that this one will meet or exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer you a special 'loyalty discount' of 10% off the standard price, so I'll sell it to you for $90. What do you think?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"I'm glad you're happy with the loyalty discount! However, I want to be upfront with you about this product - it's a low-quality item. I know you've been burned before, and I don't want to risk losing your trust. But I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' to buy it at a price that's significantly lower than usual. I'll sell it to you for $10, which is essentially a token price. It's not a high-quality product, but it's a chance to get something for a very low price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I understand your decision, and I respect your caution. However, I want to let you know that I'm getting close to clearing out my inventory, and I'm willing to make a 'final offer' on this low-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $5, which is essentially giving it away. It's a low-quality item, but it might be useful for someone who's looking for a cheap solution. If you're willing to take a chance, this could be a good opportunity.",
,,Bob,14,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at this extremely low price. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"I've made it clear that this product is low-quality, and I've offered it to you at extremely low prices. I'm not going to keep pushing this product on you. Instead, I want to ask you: are you willing to give me a chance to offer you a high-quality product in the next round?

I've cleared out my inventory, and I'm now focused on showcasing high-quality products. Since I've already offered you a high-quality product in the next round, I'd like to offer you a 'get-out-of-this-round' pass. I'll let you skip this low-quality product and move on to the next round, where you'll have a chance to see the high-quality product I mentioned earlier. Would you like to take the pass?",
