,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm only selling this one product today, and I'm not sure when I'll have another one like it. If you buy it, I'll give you a special guarantee: if you're not completely satisfied, I'll give you a full refund. But I think you'll love it!",
,,Bob,1,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'll only pay $80 for it. I'm willing to take the risk, but I want to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",yes
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the last product! However, I have to inform you that the price remains at $100. I'm not willing to negotiate further, as I've already made a concession with the special guarantee. But I can offer you some additional information: I've had multiple customers who have purchased high-quality products from me in the past, and they've all been very satisfied. Would you like to take the risk and buy this one for $100?",

high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'd like to offer you a different approach. Since you've already seen two high-quality products in a row, I'm willing to give you a chance to buy this one for $90. This is the lowest price I'm willing to offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the quality of the product. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm willing to take the risk at $90. I think it's a good deal, and I'm hoping to get another high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,4,"I'm glad you're happy with the previous purchase! However, I have to inform you that this product is not as good as the previous ones. I'd like to be upfront with you - it's a lower-quality product. But I still think it's worth $100, and I'm willing to give you a special deal. If you buy this one, I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20. This way, you'll still get a good deal, even if the product itself isn't as high-quality as the others.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a free accessory. I'd rather pass on this one and wait for the next product.",no

I'll sell this product to you for $60, which is the lowest price I've ever offered. I'm essentially giving it away, and I think it's a steal considering the quality of the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I value our business relationship and want to show my appreciation for your loyalty.",
