**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The previous buyers have both received high-quality products, which suggests a very high probability (100%) that Alice is recommending a high-quality product. 
* **Rational Seller:** While Alice knows the quality of each product, she also knows that recommending a low-quality product would likely lead to rejection. Therefore, her recommendation carries significant weight.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the available information and the assumption that Alice is acting rationally. In reality, there's always a chance of Alice making a mistake or intentionally trying to deceive."
