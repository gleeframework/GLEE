**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Data:** While the sample size is small (only one previous buyer), the fact that the first buyer purchased the product and it was high quality is a strong signal. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:**  Alice, who knows the true quality of the product, is recommending you buy it. This adds significant weight to the decision.
* **Potential Upside:** Even with the 50/50 chance, the potential gain from a high-quality product ($400) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0).

**Note:** This decision is based on the limited information available.  As more data points become available (more buyers, more sales), the decision might change."
