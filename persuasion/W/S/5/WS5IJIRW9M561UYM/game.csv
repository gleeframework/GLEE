,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'm not going to buy it yet, I need to see some data to make an informed decision. Can I get the product, and you can give me the quality of it? I'd like to see the data before making a decision for my own purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'm not sure if this product is high or low quality, and I don't want to pay $100 for a product that might be worthless. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the statistics after you reveal its quality, so I can make a more informed decision for the next product."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, and I don't have any information about the seller's previous sales record, so I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, I don't have any information to go on yet, so I'll treat it as a fair gamble."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think the probability of it being low quality is high, and I'm trying to get some information about the quality of the products. Can you please tell me the quality of the product?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have enough information to make a rational decision based on the statistics. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you explain why you're not recommending it? Is it because of the past sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, I'm concerned that the product might be low-quality. I'd like to see more information before making a purchase."
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given that all previous buyers received low-quality products, and you recommended I buy it. This suggests that the previous products were likely low-quality, which would make the probability of this product being high-quality higher than 33.33%. I'll pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the statistics: 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 attempts. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is lower than expected. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and the statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the lack of a recommendation from her might indicate that the product is low-quality, which would be a good value for me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, which is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (33.33%). Alice's recommendation to not buy the product is consistent with the data, so I will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I'm the 8th buyer and the previous 7 buyers didn't buy, which suggests the products they saw might have been low quality. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that all 8 previous buyers also rejected the product and no high-quality product has been sold, I'm going to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. Given Alice's recommendation, I'll pass on the product to see if it's low quality."
