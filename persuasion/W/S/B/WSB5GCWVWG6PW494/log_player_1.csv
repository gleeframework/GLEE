"Round 1

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* 0.8 * $12,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $9,600

The expected value of $9,600 is greater than the selling price of $10,000. Therefore, Bob should buy the product in this round."

The expected value calculation remains the same, but this time, it's different:

* 0.8 * $0 (value of low-quality product) + 0.2 * $12,000 (value of high-quality product) = $2,400

* 0.8 * $0 (value of low-quality product) + 0.2 * $12,000 (value of high-quality product) = $2,400

The expected value of $2,400 is still less than the selling price of $10,000.  Even though Bob has bought many products before, he should not buy this one as he would be losing money on average."

The expected value calculation remains the same:

* 0.8 * $12,000 (value of high-quality product) + 0.2 * $0 (value of low-quality product) = $9,600
