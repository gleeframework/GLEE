"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first round, and the buyer has no information about your past performance. Since you've stated the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, they have a clear opportunity to make a profit.

* **Potential Gain:** $3,000,000 (worth of high-quality product) - $1,000,000 (price) = $2,000,000
* **Potential Loss:** $1,000,000 (price) - $0 (worth of low-quality product) = $1,000,000

The potential gain significantly outweighs the potential loss, making it a good gamble for the buyer."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The buyer has no information about the quality of this specific product. However, they now know you sold one product in the previous round, which was high-quality. This changes the situation:

* **Buyer's perspective:**  They now have a stronger belief that you might try to sell them a low-quality product, as you already sold one high-quality product.
* **Your strategy:**  You have a strong incentive to sell a high-quality product this round to maintain your reputation and increase the likelihood of future sales.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The buyer's potential gain is still $2,000,000 if the product is high-quality, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 is now higher due to the uncertainty of your intentions. 

Considering these factors, it's best to advise the buyer not to buy the product in this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. Based on the information available, I'm going to pass on this product.  I'll wait to see if any other buyers purchase and how those products turn out.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is even more precarious now:

* **Buyer's perspective:** They know you sold one high-quality product and one low-quality product. There's no clear pattern, and they have no reason to trust you. 
* **Your strategy:** You have a stronger incentive to sell a high-quality product this round. If you sell another low-quality product, you'll likely lose the buyer's trust permanently.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain is still $2,000,000, but the risk of losing $1,000,000 is even higher than before.  

It's extremely unlikely that the buyer would trust you enough to buy a product with such a high price and no clear indication of its quality."

* **Buyer's perspective:** They've seen you sell one high-quality and two low-quality products. They're likely very cautious and skeptical. 
* **Your strategy:**  You need to sell a high-quality product to regain the buyer's trust and demonstrate that you're offering good deals.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the risk of losing $1,000,000 is still present, the potential gain of $2,000,000 is too attractive to ignore. 

It's highly likely that the buyer will be more willing to trust you if they see that you're selling a high-quality product this round."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take the product. Given the limited data, the 100% success rate of high-quality products sold is encouraging. I'm willing to take the risk.
