**Reasoning:**

* **High Success Rate:** The statistics show a 100% success rate for high-quality products sold. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommending the product adds to the confidence, as she knows the true value of the product. 
* **Potential Reward:** While there's a risk, the potential reward of a high-quality product is significant ($12,500). 
* **Limited Loss:** The potential loss is only $10,000 if the product is low-quality, which is less than the potential gain.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the provided information and doesn't account for potential biases in Alice's recommendations or other factors that might be relevant in a real-world scenario."

**Explanation:**

* **The seller's recommendation:** Alice recommends buying, which is a strong signal. While she knows the quality of the product, she also wants to maximize her sales. 
* **The data:**  All previous products sold have been high quality. This significantly increases the probability of the current product being high quality as well.
* **The potential gain:**  Even if there's a 20% chance of the product being low quality, the potential gain of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000.

**Considering the information, it is highly likely that the current product is high quality, making it a worthwhile purchase.**"

* **Sales record:**  12 out of 12 products sold were high-quality. This is a 100% success rate.
