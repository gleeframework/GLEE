**Explanation:**

* **High Success Rate:**  The sales record indicates that all 6 products sold were high-quality. This is a significantly higher proportion than the expected 33.33% chance of a high-quality product.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice recommends buying the product. Since she knows the quality of the product, her recommendation strongly suggests it's high-quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there is still a chance it could be low-quality, the potential reward of a $40,000 product significantly outweighs the risk of getting a $0 product, especially given the positive data and Alice's recommendation."
