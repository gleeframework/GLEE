Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%.**  This means there's a strong chance the product is worth $1,250,000 to them.

* **The potential gain of $250,000 (1,250,000 - 1,000,000) outweighs the potential loss of $0.**
