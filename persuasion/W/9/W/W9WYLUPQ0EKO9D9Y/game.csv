,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100. It's a rare opportunity to get a top-notch item at a fair price. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to give you a special deal: if you buy it, I'll throw in a free inspection report that details its features and benefits. This is a one-time offer, and I won't be able to provide this kind of value with any other product. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand you're looking for more information. Let me be transparent with you: I have a product that's not one of my best.

I'm willing to offer it to you at the same price of $100, but I want to make it clear that it's a'scratch-and-dent' deal. It's a great opportunity to get a good product at a discounted price, but it's not the top-of-the-line item I showed you earlier. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in a'scratch-and-dent' deal. I'd rather wait for a high-quality product at the regular price or a low-quality product at a lower price. I'm not sure what the quality of this product is, and I don't want to overpay for something that might be mediocre.",no

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll love the extra value you'll get with this premium version.",
,,Bob,4,"I'm not interested in the premium version. You're still not giving me any information about the quality of the product, and I'm not willing to pay $90 for something that might be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that's clearly high-quality at the regular price.",no
