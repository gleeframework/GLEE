low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to make an informed decision, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 66.67% chance it might be low quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, it seems that all products recommended by you have been low quality, so I'm inclined to wait for a recommendation from a future buyer to see if the quality of the products improves."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 1, I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount or a guarantee of a high-quality product. Otherwise, I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold out of the previous 2, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being offered. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I've done my math. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth only $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6000 for it, considering the low probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information or see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?"
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reason behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is 0, or is there another reason?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's high-quality."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product after your recommendation, and none of the products sold so far were high-quality, I'm going to assume that the probability of a high-quality product being offered is lower than 33.33%. I'll pass on this product to see if it's low-quality and to get more information for future decisions."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 5 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the fact that 5 buyers have purchased the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. I'm concerned that the product might be low quality given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
