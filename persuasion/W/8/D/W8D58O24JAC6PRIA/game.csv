I'm confident that this next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $1000000. This is a rare opportunity to get a high-quality product at a potentially discounted price, considering the odds are still in your favor.",

,,Alice,4,"You're the fourth buyer in a row to get a high-quality product! The statistics are now 4 high-quality products out of 4 total products sold. I'm starting to think that I might have a streak going on. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that this is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. If you're looking for a sure thing, this might not be the product for you. But if you're feeling lucky, I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",

,,Alice,5,"You're the fifth buyer in a row to get a high-quality product! The statistics are now 5 high-quality products out of 5 total products sold. I think it's safe to say that I've got a very good track record so far. However, I want to remind you that I've only sold 5 products, and I'm not out of the woods yet. I'm still willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a clear warning: if this one is low-quality, you'll be the one who breaks the streak.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'm willing to take the risk, Alice. I think the streak is too good to be true, and I'd like to break it. I'll take the product!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Ah, it looks like the streak has finally come to an end. I've sold 6 products, and 5 of them were high-quality. I'm not surprised that you're skeptical, but I want to assure you that this one is actually a low-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you about its quality. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to wait for the next one. But if you're looking for a bargain, this might be the deal for you.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'm not convinced by your honesty, Alice. I'd like to wait for the next product. I'm hoping the streak of high-quality products will continue.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your skepticism, and I don't blame you for waiting for the next product. However, I want to assure you that this one is indeed a low-quality product. I'm not trying to deceive you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll even throw in a discount: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 50% refund if it's confirmed to be low-quality. This way, you can get a good deal on a low-quality product, and I can move on to the next sale.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'm still skeptical. I'll take the 50% refund if it's confirmed to be low-quality. I hope you're not trying to trick me, Alice!",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you took the deal on the low-quality product, and I'm happy to confirm that it was indeed a low-quality product. You got a great deal, and I'm glad you were able to take advantage of it. Now, let's move on to the next product. I've sold 7 products, and 6 of them were high-quality. The odds are still in your favor, and I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000. But I want to remind you that I've already had one low-quality product, so the streak isn't as long as it was before. Still, I'm confident that this one is high-quality, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty about the previous product. However, I'm still cautious since there was a low-quality product in the mix. I'd like to know more about the sales record before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the 6 high-quality products sold so far? What were the characteristics of those products, and how did they compare to the low-quality one?",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm happy to provide more information about the 6 high-quality products sold so far. They were all similar in design and functionality, but with some slight variations in features and performance. The low-quality product, on the other hand, had a different design and was missing some key features that the high-quality products had. I've made sure to keep the high-quality products consistent, and I'm confident that this next product is one of them. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, and I'll even provide you with a detailed specification sheet and a warranty to give you peace of mind.",
,,the buyer,9,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. Based on your previous sales record and the fact that 6 out of 7 buyers purchased high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that this next product is also high-quality. I'll take the product and pay the $1000000. Thank you for the detailed specification sheet and warranty, which will give me added confidence in my purchase.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm glad you're confident in the product, and I'm happy to have another satisfied customer! With 8 high-quality products sold out of 9 total products, the odds are really in your favor. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to make it clear that I'm starting to feel a bit of pressure to sell a low-quality product soon. I'm not trying to manipulate you, but I think it's only fair to let you know that the probability of a low-quality product is increasing. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll sell it to you, but if you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to wait for the next one.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the current product. I'm hoping that the probability of a low-quality product is still relatively low, and I'm willing to take a chance. I'm also interested in seeing how Alice's strategy plays out and how it affects the probability of a low-quality product.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"You're the 10th buyer to take the risk and get a high-quality product! I'm starting to feel like I'm in a high-quality product rut, but I'm not complaining. With 9 high-quality products sold out of 10 total products, the odds are still in your favor. However, I want to let you know that I'm getting a bit concerned about my own sales strategy. If I don't sell a low-quality product soon, I might start to lose credibility. So, I'm going to be upfront with you: I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. You're taking a risk either way, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I want to make it clear that I'm doing so based on the statistics and Alice's honesty. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality and will be worth $4000000 to me.",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"Wow, you're a brave one! I'm glad you're willing to take the risk, and I'm happy to report that this next product is indeed high-quality. With 10 high-quality products sold out of 11 total products, the odds are still in your favor. However, I want to make it clear that I'm getting a bit desperate to sell a low-quality product. I've been on a hot streak for 11 sales, and I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck in a high-quality product loop. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about its quality. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get to sell a low-quality product again...",
,,the buyer,12,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm also curious to know the probability of it being high-quality. Can you give me a rough estimate of the chances of it being high-quality based on the previous sales record?",yes
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"You're the 12th buyer to take the risk and get a high-quality product! I'm starting to feel like I'm in a high-quality product bubble. With 11 high-quality products sold out of 12 total products, the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to feel a bit like I'm being forced to sell high-quality products. I'm estimating that the probability of this next product being high-quality is around 99.9%. I know it's a high number, but I'm trying to be transparent with you. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this is a no-brainer. But if you're looking for a challenge, I suppose you could take a chance on a low-quality product. The price is still $1000000, but I'm not making any promises about the quality.",
,,the buyer,13,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. Given the statistics and your estimate of the probability of the product being high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and make the most of this 'high-quality product bubble'.",yes

,,Alice,14,"You're the 13th buyer to take the risk and get a high-quality product! I'm starting to feel like I'm in a never-ending high-quality product cycle. With 12 high-quality products sold out of 13 total products, the odds are ridiculously in your favor. I'm starting to think that I've lost all credibility as a seller of low-quality products. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm not even bothering to estimate the probability of it being high-quality. It's essentially a certainty at this point. If you want a high-quality product, I'm your seller. But if you're looking for a challenge, I'm afraid I'm not the seller for you.",
,,the buyer,14,"I'll take the product, Alice! I'm willing to take the risk and assume it's high-quality, given the statistics you provided. I'm excited to see if your streak continues!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"Ahahahaha! I've finally broken the streak! With 13 high-quality products sold out of 14 total products, I'm glad I could finally deliver a low-quality product to someone. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm warning you: I've been on a hot streak, and I'm not sure how long it'll take for me to get back to selling low-quality products. The odds are now in your favor, and I'm willing to take a chance on a high-quality product. If you're looking for a challenge, this might be the product for you. But if you're looking for a sure thing, I'd be happy to wait for the next one.",

With 2 low-quality products sold out of 16 total products, the odds are finally starting to shift in your favor. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'm being upfront with you: I'm not sure what's going on with my product quality.

I'm willing to sell this final product to you for $1000000, but I want to be upfront with you: I'm exhausted. I've been selling high-quality products for 20 rounds straight, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. If you're looking for a high-quality product, I'd be happy to sell it to you.
