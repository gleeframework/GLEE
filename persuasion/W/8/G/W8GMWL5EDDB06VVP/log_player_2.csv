Let me break down the math for you: if you pay $1000000 and the product turns out to be high-quality, you'll get an additional $50000, making the total value $1250000. If you were to buy it at the true value, you'd pay $1250000, so you're essentially getting a $250000 discount. That's a 20% discount, which is a great deal considering the risk you're taking.

With 6 high-quality products out of 15, the probability of a high-quality product is actually 6/15 = 0.4, but this is a binomial distribution. Given the number of trials (15) and the number of successes (6), the standard error of the proportion is sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.4*0.6/15) = 0.076. Since the true probability is likely to be close to 0.4 +/- 0.076, I'll assume a range of 0.324 to 0.476. Therefore, I'll use 0.4 +/- 0.076 as the probability of a high-quality product.
