,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2, which is 0%. Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, I believe it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I will pass on this product."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 previous buyers did not buy high-quality products, and given the high probability of low-quality products (66.67%), I'm inclined to think that the previous buyers might have seen low-quality products.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $10000."
