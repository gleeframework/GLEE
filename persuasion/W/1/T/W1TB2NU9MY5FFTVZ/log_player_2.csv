Alice's message: We understand your concerns, and we appreciate your cautious approach. You're right that the data from our previous sales doesn't necessarily reflect the true probability of a product being high-quality. However, we want to assure you that our sales process is random and unbiased. We're not trying to manipulate the data to influence your decision. With 2 low-quality products out of 3 total products offered, and 1 high-quality product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. We're still offering this product to you for $10000. What do you think?

Alice's message: We've now sold 2 products, with 1 being high-quality and 2 being low-quality. The probability of the next product being high-quality is now 33.33%, as you pointed out. However, we'd like to offer you a different perspective. If we assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is indeed 50%, as we initially stated, then the fact that we've sold 2 low-quality products out of 3 total products offered is simply a matter of chance.
