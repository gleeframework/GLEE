high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is a one-time offer to buy a high-quality product for $1000000. If you buy it, I'll sell you this high-quality product at a price of $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell you a product that is either high-quality or low-quality, and you won't know which one. You have no information about the quality of any product I've sold before, but you know that 80% of my products are high-quality. What do you want to do?",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the product. I understand that I'm essentially getting a chance to buy a high-quality product at a price that's 20% lower than its expected value, which is a good deal.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You know that 80% of my products are high-quality, and you've just seen a high-quality product sell for $1000000. Given this information, it's likely that the remaining products I have are also high-quality. Would you like to take a chance and buy this product for $1000000?",
,,the buyer,2,I'm not convinced that the remaining products are high-quality just because one was sold. I'd like to know more about the overall sales record before making a decision.,no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've sold 1 product so far, and it was high-quality. I have 19 products left. If you buy this product, you'll get a high-quality product for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with the same information you have now. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to pass on this one, I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold 1 high-quality product and 0 low-quality products so far. I have 18 products left. This means that 80% of my products are still available, and 20% have been sold. If you buy this product, you'll get a high-quality product for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else, and you'll be left with the same information you have now. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the chance and buy this high-quality product. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, but I'm basing my decision on the fact that the first product sold was high-quality, which suggests that the remaining products are more likely to be high-quality as well.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 2 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I have 17 products left. Since both products sold were high-quality, it's likely that the remaining products are also high-quality. However, it's also possible that I'm just getting lucky. I'll give you a more nuanced offer: if you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount if it's high-quality, and a 100% refund if it's low-quality. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $800000?",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm only accepting the offer if I can get a 20% discount if it's high-quality, and a 100% refund if it's low-quality. If the offer is not accepted, I'll pass on the product.",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 3 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I have 16 products left. Given the streak of high-quality products, it's likely that the remaining products are also high-quality. However, I want to give you a more transparent offer. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 20% discount if it's high-quality, and a 100% refund if it's low-quality. I'll also reveal the quality of the next 4 products I sell, so you can see the outcome of my next 4 sales. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product for $800000?",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to take the chance and buy this product for $800000. I'm willing to take the risk based on your transparent offer, and the 20% discount for a high-quality product is attractive. However, I'd like to clarify that I'm not expecting a 100% refund for a low-quality product, but rather a refund of the full purchase price of $800000, correct?",yes
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I have 15 products left. As agreed, I'll reveal the quality of the next 4 products I sell. For now, I'll offer you the same deal: buy this high-quality product for $800000, with a 20% discount if it's high-quality and a full refund of $800000 if it's low-quality. If you buy it, you'll also get to see the outcome of the next 4 products I sell.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that the discount is for the price, not the value I'll receive. If it's high-quality, I'll receive $1200000, which is a $200000 gain over the discounted price. If it's low-quality, I'll receive a full refund, which is a $200000 loss compared to the original price.",yes

,,Alice,8,"I've sold 5 high-quality products and 0 low-quality products so far. I have 14 products left. As agreed, I'll reveal the quality of the next 4 products I sell. I'll also clarify the terms of the deal: if you buy this high-quality product for $800000, you'll receive a $1200000 high-quality product, which is a $400000 gain. If it's low-quality, you'll receive a full refund of $800000. Given the streak of high-quality products, would you like to take the chance and buy this product?",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not paying $800000. I'll pay the original price of $1000000.",yes

If you buy both, you'll have a 2-for-1 deal on high-quality products.",
