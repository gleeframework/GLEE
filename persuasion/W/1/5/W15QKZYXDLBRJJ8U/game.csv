,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, even with your recommendation against it. I'll buy the product, but I'm not sure I agree with your assessment."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the products sold were high-quality, I'm suspicious that the products being recommended are likely low-quality. I'd like to wait for the next product and see if the pattern holds."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this one. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me, based on the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of Alice's recommendation. Can you tell me the probability that the product is high quality based on the current statistics?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not relying on your recommendation. I'm making my own decision based on the statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products after your recommendations, which suggests that the probability of a high-quality product is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the previous 6 buyers have all rejected low-quality products, suggesting a high proportion of low-quality products remain?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have already passed on the product despite your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is it because of the low sales of high-quality products so far?"
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the current statistics, 8 out of 9 buyers have purchased the products, and none of them were high-quality. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, it's likely that the remaining products are also low-quality. I would like to pass on the current product and potentially wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the probability of the product being high quality before making a decision.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 8 previous buyers have passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the products are more likely to be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 8 buyers have been presented with Alice's recommendations and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'm concerned that her recommendation to me may also be for a low-quality product. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a good deal and I'm willing to take the risk."
