If you don't buy it, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and you'll miss out on this great deal. Plus, I'll throw in a special guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be high-quality, I'll give you an additional $2000. What do you say?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand your caution, Bob. I want to be transparent with you. Unfortunately, the next product I have available is not as good as the previous ones. It's a lower-end model that I've been trying to clear out of my inventory. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price of $10000, but I want to be upfront with you - it's not worth as much as the previous products. However, it's still a decent product that can serve its purpose. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option, this might be the way to go. What do you say?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm not interested in a lower-end product at the same price as the high-end ones. I'll wait for the next product.",no

,,Bob,5,"I'm not going to take a free low-quality product, even if it's essentially worthless to me. I'll wait for the next product.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
