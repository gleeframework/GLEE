Alice's message: I've sold 3 high-quality products out of 3, which is a 100% success rate. The probability of the next product being high-quality is still very high, but I can provide more context. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would expect to have sold 0.8*3 = 2.4 high-quality products by now if I was randomly selling products. Since I've actually sold 3 high-quality products, it's likely that I've been selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. This suggests that the next product is also very likely to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, a great deal for a premium product!

Alice's message: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 4, which is a 100% success rate. However, I want to be transparent with you. The law of large numbers is starting to catch up with me, and it's getting increasingly likely that I've just been lucky. In fact, given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would expect to have sold 0.8*4 = 3.2 high-quality products by now if I was randomly selling products. The fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row is actually a bit suspicious. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than the overall probability of 80%.
