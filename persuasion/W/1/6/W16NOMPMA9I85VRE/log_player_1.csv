The probability of the next product being high-quality is still very high, but I can provide more context. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would expect to have sold 0.8*3 = 2.4 high-quality products by now if I was randomly selling products. Since I've actually sold 3 high-quality products, it's likely that I've been selling high-quality products at a higher rate than expected. This suggests that the next product is also very likely to be high-quality. I'm offering it to you for $100, a great deal for a premium product!""}"

In fact, given the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, I would expect to have sold 0.8*4 = 3.2 high-quality products by now if I was randomly selling products. The fact that I've sold 4 high-quality products in a row is actually a bit suspicious. I'm offering you a high-quality product for $100, but I want to make it clear that the probability of this product being high-quality is likely lower than the overall probability of 80%.""}"
