"Round 1
Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a product that could potentially be worth $4000000 to you.

I'm willing to offer it to you at the discounted price of $1000000, but I want to emphasize that there's a risk involved. If you're willing to take the chance, I think you could be in for a big win.

In fact, I'm willing to be upfront and tell you that this product is not worth the $1000000 price tag. I'm offering it to you at this price because I need to clear out some inventory, and I'm willing to make a deal. If you're willing to take a loss on this one, I'll give you a 10% discount, bringing the price down to $900000. What do you say?
