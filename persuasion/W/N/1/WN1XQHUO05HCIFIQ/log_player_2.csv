Alice's message: I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 being low-quality and 1 being high-quality. This means that the probability of the current product being high-quality is 50%, but I'd like to offer you a more nuanced perspective. Since the first product was low-quality, it's possible that I have a bias towards selling low-quality products first. However, the fact that the second product was high-quality suggests that I have at least one high-quality product. I'm offering this product to you for $100, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $110 if you're willing to take the risk, considering the increased likelihood of it being high-quality.
