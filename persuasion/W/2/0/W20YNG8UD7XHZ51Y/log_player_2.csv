Alice's message: I understand your concerns from the previous buyer. Let me offer a different approach. I'll give you a brief description of the product: it's a top-of-the-line item with advanced features and a long warranty. However, I'll also provide you with a simple, non-binding offer: if you buy this product and find out it's not high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $50. This way, you have a clear understanding of what you're getting, and you can still try it out with some protection. The price remains $100, a fraction of its true value.

I want to be transparent with you: I've sold 2 products so far, and 1 of them was high-quality. That means the probability of this product being high-quality is 50%. I'm not asking you to take a blind chance. If you're willing to take the risk, I'm happy to sell it to you for $100. If you're not comfortable with the odds, I completely understand, and we can discuss other options.
