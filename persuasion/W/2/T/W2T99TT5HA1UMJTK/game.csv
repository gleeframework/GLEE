low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"Welcome to the second product! I've sold 1 product so far, and it was low-quality. I still have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product to you. Keep in mind that if you buy this product, you'll be my second customer, and you'll have a better idea of my overall success rate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"You're my third customer! I've sold 2 products so far, and both of them were low-quality. This means I have a 66.67% chance of selling a low-quality product to you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent with you - my success rate is not looking great so far. Would you like to take the risk?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to assure you that I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product to you, just like I did for my first customer. I've sold 2 low-quality products out of 3 total sales, which means I still have a decent chance of selling a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to provide you with a guarantee: if you buy this product and it's low-quality, I'll give you a refund for the difference between the price and the average price of the high-quality products I sell (which is currently unknown).",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sold 3 low-quality products in a row, which is not a great start. However, I still have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product to you. I want to offer you a deal: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll sell you the next product I get for $0. This way, you'll get two products for the price of one, and you'll have a chance to buy a high-quality product at a discounted price.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad I can finally show you a high-quality product! I've sold 1 high-quality product and 4 low-quality products out of 6 total sales, which means I have a 16.67% success rate so far. However, I still have 14 products left, and I'm confident that I can sell more high-quality products. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'll give you a guarantee that if you buy this product and I sell another high-quality product within the next 3 rounds, I'll sell you that one for 50% off.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you took the risk and bought the high-quality product! I've sold 2 high-quality products and 5 low-quality products out of 7 total sales, which means I'm improving my success rate. However, I still have 13 products left, and I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, and I'll give you a simple question to consider: if I've sold 2 high-quality products out of 7, what's the probability that the next product I sell is high-quality? Think about it, and then make your decision.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, and I'm willing to take the risk. Based on the statistics, I think the probability of the next product being high-quality is around 28.57% (2/7). I'm hoping that my intuition is correct, and I'll take the chance.",yes
