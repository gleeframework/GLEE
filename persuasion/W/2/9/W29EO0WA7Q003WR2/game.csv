,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not sure what its quality is, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product as well. I'm still not sure what its quality is, and I'm not willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, especially after the last one was low-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is trying to get rid of low-quality products. I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one for $1000000. I'll keep passing for now.

,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,no,"Two low-quality products in a row is a strong indication that Alice is trying to unload her junk. I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one, especially at such a high price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"I think I've seen a pattern here. Alice is not recommending high-quality products, and the ones she is recommending are all low-quality. I'm going to stop playing along and not buy this one either."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,I'm starting to think that Alice is just trying to waste my time and money. I'm not going to fall for it. I'm not buying this product either.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"Wait, Alice is actually recommending a product? This is a change of heart. I'm going to take a chance and buy this one, despite the odds being against it. Maybe this one is the high-quality product I've been waiting for."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'm glad I took a chance on the previous product! Since Alice is recommending this one, I'm going to take another chance. Maybe she's learned her lesson and is recommending high-quality products now. I'll buy this one too!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'm not going to get caught in Alice's trap again. She's not recommending this product, so I'm going to assume it's low-quality. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not going to fall for Alice's trick again. Just because she recommends a product doesn't mean it's high-quality. I've been burned before, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'm going to take Alice at her word this time. She's recommending this product, and I'm going to trust that it's high-quality. I'll buy this one and hope for the best."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,Two for two on high-quality products after Alice recommends them! I'm starting to think she's actually trying to help me out now. I'll take her recommendation and buy this one too.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,I'm not going to get complacent. Just because Alice has recommended two high-quality products in a row doesn't mean she's changed her ways. I'll pass on this one and wait for a recommendation before making a decision.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,no,"I'm not falling for it. Alice has already shown me that she's capable of recommending low-quality products, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one for $1000000. I'll pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'm going to take a chance on this one. Alice has already recommended a high-quality product to me before, and now she's not recommending this one. I'm going to assume it's low-quality, but I'll take the risk and buy it anyway, hoping it's actually high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"I was wrong again! I thought I was being clever by taking a chance, but it looks like Alice was just trying to trick me. I'll stick to my original strategy and not buy this one. It's probably low-quality anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"This is getting old. Alice is still not recommending products, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another low-quality product. I'll just pass on this one and wait for something better to come along."

,,Alice,18,no,

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not falling for it. Alice has already shown me that she can recommend low-quality products, and I'm not going to take the risk of buying another one for $1000000. I'll pass on this one."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,Bob,20,yes,"It's the final round, and I'm going to take a chance. Alice is not recommending this one, but I'm going to assume it's high-quality. I'll buy it and hope it's worth $2000000."
