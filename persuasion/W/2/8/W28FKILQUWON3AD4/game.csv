I'm willing to provide you with a detailed description of the product, which I'll reveal to you after the purchase. However, I must inform you that this product is not one of the high-quality ones that I have in stock. Would you like to take a chance and buy it?",

,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your caution. I'd like to offer you a more concrete incentive to consider purchasing this product. If you buy this product, I'll provide you with a unique serial number that will give you access to exclusive updates and priority support for all future products I offer you. This is a one-time offer, and you won't find this benefit with any other seller. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity and buy this product for $10000?",

,,Alice,3,"I understand that the exclusive updates and priority support weren't enough to sway you. I'd like to offer you a more straightforward approach. I'll give you a 50/50 chance to get a refund if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality. If it is high-quality, you'll get the product as usual. If it's low-quality, you'll get a full refund of $10000. Would you like to take this calculated risk and buy the product?",

,,Alice,4,"I'm not going to offer you another low-quality product. I'll be honest with you, I've shown you two low-quality products in a row, and I understand that's not what you're looking for. Let me ask you a question: If I were to offer you a product that I'm 100% certain is high-quality, would you be willing to buy it for $10000? If so, I'll reveal the quality of this product to you right now, and you can decide whether to buy it or not.",

However, if you do decide to buy it, I'll give you an additional $500 credit towards your next purchase if you buy it now.",

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations, I'm glad I could finally offer you a high-quality product! I want to assure you that this product is one of the best I have, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with it. I'll give you a detailed description of its features and specifications, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

,,Alice,7,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase! However, I understand that this product is a different story. Given that you've already bought one high-quality product from me, I want to offer you a special deal on this one. I'll give you a'second-chance' discount of $5000 off the original price, making it $4500. This is the lowest price I've ever offered on a low-quality product.

,,Alice,9,"I understand your decision, and I'll respect it. However, I want to make one last offer on this low-quality product. I'll give you a 'last chance' discount of $2000 off the price, making it $3500. But here's the twist: if you buy this product, I'll also give you a 'free' chance to buy the next product at the price you think it's worth, without me revealing its quality. You can negotiate the price with me, and if you're right, you'll get the product at that price. If you're wrong, you'll still get the product at the standard price of $10000.
