,,Alice,12,"I'm glad you're excited about the previous products, Bob! I'd like to offer you another exceptional product that's truly a game-changer.

And at the price of $1000000, it's a great opportunity to stock up on something that will still meet your needs. Would you like to take a chance on this reliable product?",
,,Bob,13,"You're not guaranteeing the quality of the product, and you're describing it as 'not the most exceptional' and 'a solid choice that will get the job done.' This language suggests that the product may be low-quality, and I'm not willing to take that risk. I'll wait for a guaranteed high-quality product or more information before making a purchase.",no

It's a risk, but it could also be a great opportunity to get a good deal. What do you think?",

What do you think?",
,,Bob,17,"A 50% refund is not enough to mitigate the risk of buying a low-quality product. If the product is low-quality, I'll still lose $500000.

But if you're looking for a chance to make a profit, this might be your last opportunity. What do you think?",
