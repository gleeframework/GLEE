,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to think that you're being honest, but I'm not sure if this product is high-quality or not. With only one high-quality product sold out of one, I'm not convinced that you're on a hot streak. I'll pass on this one.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're interested in the previous buyer's decision! To be honest, I don't know what went through their mind, and I'm not trying to influence your decision. What I do know is that I've sold 3 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products, so the odds are slightly in your favor. The price remains $100, and I'm still willing to take the risk with you. Will you take a chance?",

If not, I'm still willing to take the risk with you.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'll take the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather on my own assessment of the odds. Given the updated statistics, I believe the probability of the product being high-quality is indeed 50%, and the expected value is $100. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it at the fixed price of $100.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 6 high-quality products and 6 low-quality products, so the odds are still 50% in favor of a high-quality product. I've been transparent about the sales record, and I'm willing to continue doing so. The price remains $100, and I'm still willing to take the risk with you. Keep in mind that the expected value is still $50, and you're essentially paying for the chance to get a high-quality product. What do you think?",

,,Alice,14,"I see you're thinking critically about my recommendation. To be honest, I don't have a specific logic behind why this product is more likely to be high-quality. The probability is just a number, and I'm willing to take the risk with you. I've sold 8 high-quality products and 9 low-quality products, so the odds are still in your favor. The price remains $100, and I'm willing to make the sale. You're essentially buying a 53.33% chance of a high-quality product. What do you think?",

,,Alice,15,"You are correct that the probability of a high-quality product is 8/17. I appreciate your attention to detail. I've sold 9 high-quality products and 10 low-quality products, so the odds are now 47.06% in favor of a high-quality product. The price remains $100, and I'm willing to take the risk with you. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this might be a good opportunity. I'm transparent about the odds, and I'm willing to make the sale.",
,,the buyer,15,"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product. However, I'd like to know, if I were to pass on the product, would you consider offering it to the next buyer with a lower price, considering the updated odds?",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,

high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"I'm glad you're being honest about your approach. I've sold 11 high-quality products and 13 low-quality products, so the odds are now 45.83% in favor of a high-quality product.

high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"I respect your decision to wait for a better opportunity. I've sold 12 high-quality products and 13 low-quality products, so the odds are now 48.00% in favor of a high-quality product. This is my last product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. If you're looking for a high-quality product, this might be a good chance to get one. I'm willing to take the risk with you, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. This is your last chance to buy from me, so what do you think?",
,,the buyer,20,"I'd like to buy the product, but I want to make sure that the odds are indeed 48% in favor of a high-quality product. Can you explain how you calculated that? I'm not sure if I understand the math behind it.",yes
