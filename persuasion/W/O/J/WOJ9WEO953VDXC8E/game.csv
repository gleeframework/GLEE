low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I'm the first one, and I don't have any prior information to go by. I'm taking a shot in the dark."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is against it. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that she knows my valuation and is trying to manipulate me. I'm going to take the contrarian approach and buy it, even if it's low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think the low-quality products have been overrepresented in the previous sales, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality one. Can you confirm whether it's high or low quality after I make the purchase?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the statistics, I'm surprised that no high-quality products have been sold yet. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it seems like Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to pass on this product and see if I can get a better chance to buy a high-quality one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

high-quality,12000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'll assume that this is not a reliable indicator of the overall quality of the products. I'll take a chance and pass on this one."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to wait for more data or a different recommendation."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that none of the previous 5 buyers found a high-quality product. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase.
