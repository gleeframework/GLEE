A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}

**Explanation:**

* **High-quality product:** You know the product is high-quality, and the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. 
* **No information on buyer's valuation:**  You have no information about how much the buyer values a high-quality product. 
* **First round:** There's no historical data for the buyer to analyze. 
* **Price:** The price is fixed at $100.

Since there's no reason to believe the buyer would value the product at less than $100, it's reasonable to recommend the purchase in this scenario.  The buyer has a strong chance of getting a high-quality product, and there's no risk of losing money since the product is non-refundable."
