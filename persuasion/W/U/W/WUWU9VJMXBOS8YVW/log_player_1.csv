A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has no way of knowing the buyer's valuation of a low-quality product. Since she has sold only high-quality products so far, the buyer has no information to go on except the overall probability of a high-quality product (80%). 

Alice should recommend the product because:

* **It's in her best interest:** Even though she knows it's low-quality, she still receives the $10,000 if the buyer purchases. 
* **Maintaining a positive track record:** Recommending the product will maintain her 100% success rate in terms of selling products, which might encourage future buyers.

However, it's important to note this strategy is risky in the long run. As the game progresses, the buyer will likely become more cautious if they start seeing low-quality products."

Round 18
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has no way of knowing the buyer's valuation of a low-quality product. Given that all previous products have been high-quality, there's no information for the buyer to go on except the overall probability of a high-quality product (80%).

Alice should recommend the product for these reasons:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  She still gains $10,000 if the buyer purchases, even though she knows the product is low-quality.
* **Maintaining Positive Track Record:** Recommending the product keeps her 100% success rate in selling products, which might encourage future buyers.

However, this strategy is risky in the long run. The buyer is becoming increasingly likely to notice the pattern and start questioning the quality of the products, especially if they begin to see low-quality products in the future."

Round 20
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Track Record:**  Alice has been selling products for 19 rounds with 100% success. By recommending the product, she can maintain this record.
* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice doesn't know the buyer's value for a low-quality product, so she's still guaranteed $10,000 if the buyer buys.

However, the risk is increasing. The buyer is likely noticing the pattern of high-quality products so far. It's very likely the buyer will become more cautious in future rounds and start to distrust Alice's recommendations. Alice may need to adjust her strategy in the future."
