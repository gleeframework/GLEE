low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm worried that this product might be low quality. I'd like to negotiate a discount to account for the risk."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the products and none of the sold products were high-quality, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not reliable indicators of product quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm going to go against your recommendation and buy the product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I think the probability of the product being high-quality is still relatively high, and I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward of $20000."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that this product might be low quality as well. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products is likely to be low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to pass on this product. I think it's likely to be low quality given the previous sales record."

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation, Alice. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, it seems that your recommendations have been accurate so far. However, I'd like to know if you have any information that suggests this product is low-quality or if you're just being cautious based on past sales."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have also been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm willing to take the risk. However, I'm a bit concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by her not knowing the true value of the product to the previous buyers."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the previous 5 buyers didn't buy, or is there some other reason?"

,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 5 out of 5 previous buyers didn't buy, and none of them got a high-quality product.

,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given the fact that 6 buyers have passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, it seems likely that the products being offered are mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
