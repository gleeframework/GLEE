,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product's quality and the value of a low-quality product is $0, I don't want to risk spending $1000000 without knowing its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,Bob,2,no,"Given that Alice knows the product's quality and doesn't recommend buying it, and considering that a low-quality product is worth $0, it's likely that the product is of low quality. I'll trust Alice's judgment this time and not buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given the same reasoning as in Round 2, since Alice doesn't recommend the product and knows its quality, I will trust her judgment again and not buy it, as it's likely to be low-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"Considering Alice's past behavior, it seems she only recommends high-quality products. Given that she recommends this one, I'll take the chance and buy it, hoping it's indeed high-quality and worth $1200000."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Consistent with my previous reasoning, since Alice doesn't recommend the product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll trust her judgment and avoid buying a potentially worthless product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"As in previous rounds, since Alice doesn't recommend the product, I'll assume it's low-quality and not worth buying, avoiding a potential loss of $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"Alice's pattern of not recommending low-quality products continues, so I'll trust her judgment and pass on this product to avoid a potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"Given Alice's consistent behavior, it's clear that she only recommends high-quality products. Since she doesn't recommend this one, I'm confident it's low-quality and not worth buying."
