,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and both were low-quality products, I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have passed on the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'd rather wait for the next product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 out of 4 products sold so far have been low-quality, I suspect the probability of a high-quality product being offered is higher than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
