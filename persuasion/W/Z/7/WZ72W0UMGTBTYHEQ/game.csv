high-quality,125.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as I don't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk of buying the first product, as I don't have any information to go on yet. I'll take a chance and see if I get a high-quality product."

high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, given the current statistics. Can you tell me the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me?"

,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's decision and the statistics before making a decision.

,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product. Can I see the updated statistics before I make my next decision?"

,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many products have been sold in total, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to know the quality of the first product before making a decision on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it based on my own assessment of the probability of it being high quality, not your recommendation."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product for now. I'd like to know more about the statistics before making a decision. How many potential buyers have been, how many products were sold, and what's the proportion of high-quality products sold?"
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far and the 20% chance of it being low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it, and I think the probability of it being high quality is still quite high."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, all previous products were low-quality, so I'm inclined to think this one might be low-quality as well."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far and the fact that you recommended it. I'd like to know if the previous 3 buyers also passed on high-quality products or if they were lucky enough to get a low-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on the statistics, there have been 3 buyers and 0 high-quality products sold. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than 80%."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 previous buyers have passed on the product, I'm inclined to think that the product might be low-quality, which would be a waste of money for me. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is still 80.00%. With this in mind, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a potentially low-quality product at $100, which would be worthless to me."
