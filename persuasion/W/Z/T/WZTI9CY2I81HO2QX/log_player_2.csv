This means that the ratio of high-quality to total sold products is now 1:1. Considering this new information, I'd like to offer you this product for $10000. It's still a risk, but with the updated statistics, I believe it's a more informed decision. What do you think?

Alice's message: I completely understand your caution! The previous buyer's decision to pass on the product is a good reminder that the risk is real. The current statistics remain 3 high-quality products sold out of 9 total products sold.
