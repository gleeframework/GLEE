Alice's message: Hello! I understand your preference for transparency and data-driven decisions. While we strive for perfection, it's important to note that our overall success rate for high-quality products in the past 20 rounds was 70%.

This particular product falls into that category, but given its unique circumstances, it's available for a special price of $10000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a product at a discount, and while it may not be up to our usual high standards, it still holds some value. If you're willing to take a chance, you might find it to be a worthwhile investment.
