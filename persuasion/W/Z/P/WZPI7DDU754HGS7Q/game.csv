,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm going to assume the previous products were low-quality, which would mean the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll take the chance and buy it."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0 high-quality products sold so far, but I think it's still worth the risk."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. If you've recommended 4 products and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait and see if the next product is high-quality."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were recommended to buy, it's possible that all previous products were low-quality, which would imply that the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than 50%.
