Given the 33.33% chance of a product being high-quality, you're taking a calculated risk. Take advantage of this chance to own a superior product for $100.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I'm the first buyer and I don't have any information to go on. I'm hoping that Alice's optimism is justified and this is indeed a high-quality product.",yes

,,Alice,10,"I'll give you the latest statistics. Out of 9 products so far, 4 have been sold, with 1 confirmed high-quality and 3 confirmed low-quality among the sold ones. However, I'll let you in on a hint: the product I'm offering now is of exceptional quality, one that meets the highest standards.
