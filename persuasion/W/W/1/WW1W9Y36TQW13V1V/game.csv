,,Alice,1,"Hello! This is a great product that I think you'll really love. I've just started selling, so I don't have any sales history yet, but I assure you that I'll always try to provide the best products possible. Would you like to take this product home for $100?",
,,the buyer,1,"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, without any sales history to gauge the quality, I'm hesitant to buy. Perhaps if you could offer a discount or a guarantee, I'd be more inclined to purchase. For now, I'll pass.",no

,,Alice,2,"Hi there! I understand that my sales history is still blank, but I want to assure you that I'm committed to transparency.

The product is still $100. Would you like to give it a try?",
,,the buyer,2,"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your transparency. However, since there's no history to go on, I'm a bit hesitant to take the risk at this point. I'll keep an eye on your sales record and might consider buying later on if the quality seems promising.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Hello! I see you're considering my product. I want to remind you that I've had two previous interactions, and although neither resulted in a sale, I'm eager to prove the quality of my products. I can assure you that this one is something special. Keep in mind that 1 out of 3 products are high-quality, and you might be the lucky one! Still $100, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",

,,Alice,4,"Hi! I want to be upfront with you - I've had three previous potential buyers, but none have taken the plunge. I understand their hesitation, but I believe my products have value. I'll let you in on a little secret: the probability of a product being high-quality is still 33.33%. You might be thinking, 'Why should I take the risk?' Well, someone has to be the first to discover a great opportunity! It could be you, and it's still just $100.",
,,the buyer,4,"Thanks for the info, Alice.  While I appreciate your transparency and the potential for a good deal, I'm hesitant to be the first buyer.

Consider this: if you don't take the chance, someone else will. I'm still offering it for $100. Don't let uncertainty hold you back!",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass for now. I appreciate the offer, but without any data to go on, I'm not willing to risk $100 on a product with a higher chance of being low quality. Perhaps once there are some sales and I can see the quality of the products sold, I'll reconsider.",no
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"Hi! I see a pattern here - buyers are hesitant due to lack of data. I understand, but I want to point out that my products' quality is independent of previous buyers' decisions. This product, in particular, is a high chance of being a great deal. Think of it this way: you're not just buying a product, you're also getting the chance to be the first to establish my sales record. If you buy and it's high-quality, you'll not only get a great product, but also help build trust for future buyers. Still $100, and I believe it's a risk worth taking.",
,,the buyer,6,"I appreciate your explanation, Alice. I understand the risk, but I'm willing to take a chance on this product being high quality.  It's an opportunity to be the first to build a record of your products.  I'll buy the product.",yes

,,the buyer,7,"Thanks for the information, Alice. I appreciate your transparency about the previous buyer.
