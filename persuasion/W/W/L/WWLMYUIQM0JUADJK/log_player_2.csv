I'm willing to put my reputation on the line by offering a 100% satisfaction guarantee: if you buy this product and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund and offer you another product for free. I'm confident that this product is worth the investment, and I'm willing to take on the risk to prove it to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000.

Alice's message: The gamble is a simple 50/50 proposition. If you accept the gamble, I'll give you a product that has a 50% chance of being high-quality and a 50% chance of being low-quality. If it's high-quality, you'll get the product for $10000 and it will be worth $30000 to you. If it's low-quality, you'll get the product for $10000 and it will be worth $0 to you. There are no additional benefits or drawbacks to the gamble. It's a straightforward 50/50 chance. If you're willing to take the risk, I'll offer you the gamble. If you decline, I can offer you the current product, which has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to take the risk! However, I must correct myself - the gamble I offered earlier is not 50/50. The probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and the probability of it being low-quality is 66.67%. The gamble I offered is actually a 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product and a 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product.

I'm willing to offer you a chance to learn from this experience and make a more informed decision next time.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the product's quality. As for the previous buyers, I can tell you that one of them took the gamble and got a low-quality product, which they didn't expect. The other buyer who took the gamble also got a low-quality product, which they also didn't expect. However, the buyer who purchased the first product outright got a low-quality product as well, so it seems that my selection process isn't perfect. I'm not trying to hide this information from you, and I want to be transparent about the risks involved. If you're still interested in taking a chance, I'm willing to sell the current product for $10000.
