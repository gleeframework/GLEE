Alice's message: You're thinking strategically! Given the sales record, it's true that the remaining 4 products are more likely to be high-quality. With 3 high-quality products out of 7, the probability of a product being high-quality is now 42.9%. However, I'd like to point out that the law of large numbers is on my side: as I sell more products, the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the true probability of 50%. I'm still selling this product to you for $10000. It's a chance to get a high-quality product at a fixed price, and you're getting a better sense of the distribution of the remaining products.
