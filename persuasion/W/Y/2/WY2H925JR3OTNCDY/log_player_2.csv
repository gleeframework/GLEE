**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point to go on: one high-quality product sold. This is too small of a sample size to draw any strong conclusions about Alice's recommendation accuracy.
* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice has a strong incentive to recommend buying the product, as she makes a profit if you buy it, regardless of the quality.
* **50/50 Odds:** The base probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%.  Given the lack of information, it's a gamble, but the potential payoff is high. 

**Strategy:**  It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a high-quality product at a good price outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product."
