But, I also want to acknowledge that I've now sold a total of 3 products, and I'm willing to offer this next one to you for $100. I'm not making any claims about its quality, but I think it's worth considering the potential for another high-quality product at this price.",

I'm offering this next one to you for $100, but I want to be completely transparent with you: I'm out of high-quality products.

I'm not asking you to take a chance, I'm telling you: this product is probably low-quality. I'm not even offering a refund or a discount.

I'm just going to be honest with you: I've had a 55% success rate now, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm offering this product to you for $100, but I'm willing to let it go for $50. It's not worth much to me, and I just want to get rid of it. Take it or leave it, but I'm not going to try to sell it to you at a price that's not fair.",
