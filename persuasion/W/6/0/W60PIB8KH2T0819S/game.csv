low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, since Alice doesn't recommend it, it might be low quality and I'll get it for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"I'm not buying it. Alice is recommending it, so it's likely to be high-quality, but I'm not paying $10000 for a 50% chance of a $40000 product. I'll pass."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'm not buying it. I already passed on a low-quality product in the previous round, and now Alice is recommending this one. It's likely to be low-quality as well. I'll pass and avoid the potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy it. Alice is recommending it, so it's likely to be high-quality, and I'll get a $40000 product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,no,"I'm not buying it. I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product, and now Alice is recommending it. I'll pass and avoid another potential loss of $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's likely to be low-quality, and I'll get it for $10000. I'd rather take the risk of losing $10000 than throw away a potentially high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's likely to be low-quality, and I'll get it for $10000. I've already lost money on two low-quality products, but I'll try to break the streak."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. Alice doesn't recommend it, so it's likely to be low-quality, and I'll get it for $10000. At this point, I'm just trying to break the streak of consecutive low-quality products, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I've lost money on four consecutive low-quality products, but I'm starting to think that Alice might be recommending the low-quality ones. If I buy this one, it might be high-quality, and I'll get a good deal."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,no,"I'm not buying it. I've lost money on five consecutive low-quality products, and now Alice is recommending this one. I'm starting to think that Alice is recommending the low-quality ones, so I'll pass and avoid another potential loss."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"I'll take the chance and buy it. Alice is recommending it, and I've already missed out on a high-quality product in the previous round. I'll take the opportunity to get a potentially high-quality product for $10000."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy it. I just got a high-quality product for $10000, and now Alice is recommending this one. I'm going to take the chance and assume that Alice's recommendation is still a good indicator of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. Alice doesn't recommend it, but I've just had two consecutive high-quality products, so I'm feeling optimistic. I'll take the risk and hope for a third high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I just lost money on a low-quality product, but I've had two high-quality products in a row, and now Alice doesn't recommend this one. I'll take the risk and try to get back to a winning streak."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,Bob,15,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I've lost money on three consecutive low-quality products, but I've had two high-quality products in the past, and Alice doesn't recommend this one. I'll take the risk and try to break the losing streak."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I've lost money on four consecutive low-quality products, and Alice doesn't recommend this one. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of quality, so I'll take the risk and buy it anyway."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I've lost money on five consecutive low-quality products, and Alice doesn't recommend this one. At this point, I'm not relying on Alice's recommendations, and I'm just trying to break the losing streak."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it. I've lost money on six consecutive low-quality products, and Alice doesn't recommend this one. I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is actually lower than 50%."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,no,"I'm not buying it. I've lost money on seven consecutive low-quality products, and now Alice is recommending this one. I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are actually a bad indicator of quality, and I'm not going to fall for it again."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
