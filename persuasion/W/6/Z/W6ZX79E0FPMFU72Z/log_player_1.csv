Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
 
**Explanation:**

* **No information:** We still have no data on the buyer's value for either high or low-quality products. 
* **Previous buyer's behavior:**  The previous buyer's decision to wait for more information suggests they are risk-averse and value information. 
* **Low-quality product:** Given the low-quality product and the buyer's cautious nature, it's highly unlikely they would purchase. 

**Therefore, it is not recommended to sell the product to this buyer.**"
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation. As there is no information on the quality of products yet, I'll pass for now.  I'd like to see how the sales progress and what the quality of the products turns out to be before committing to a purchase.

Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No Data:** We still have no information on the buyer's value for high or low-quality products.
* **Previous Buyers:** Both previous buyers opted to wait and observe, indicating a risk-averse approach and a preference for more information. 
* **High-Quality Product:**  While this product is high-quality, the lack of data on the buyer's perception of value and their risk aversion makes a sale improbable.

**Therefore, it's not recommended to sell the product to this buyer.**  We need more information about the buyer's willingness to purchase and their valuation of high-quality products before making a recommendation."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation. Since there's no sales history yet and you're not recommending the product, I'll pass for now. I'd like to see how this plays out with other buyers first.

* **Consistent Buyer Behavior:**  All previous buyers have chosen to observe instead of purchasing. This suggests they prioritize information over immediate purchase decisions.

**Recommendation:** It's not advisable to recommend the product to this buyer. We need to gain more insights into the buyer's preferences and decision-making process before making a sale."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one.  I'd prefer to see some sales history before taking a chance on such an expensive product with such a high chance of being low quality.

Since there's no data yet, I'm hesitant to take the risk on such a low probability of a high-quality product.
