low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, given your previous recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm aware of the probability of it being high quality."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice's recommendations have been wrong so far. It seems like she's recommending low-quality products. I'd like to wait for a different recommendation or more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'll pass on this one. I'll wait for the next product, hoping it might be high-quality."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I think you're being too cautious with your recommendations. I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one who gets the good one!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers received a recommendation not to buy, I'm inclined to think that all products sold so far were low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it's likely that the next product will also be low quality, which would be a waste of my $1000000. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have purchased the product despite the lack of high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products being sold are likely to be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received low-quality products and were recommended to buy, it's likely that the product is low-quality. I'll wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far, and I'm surprised you don't recommend it. Is there a reason for that?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that you don't recommend it. I'm basing my decision on the probability of the product being high-quality, which is 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'm not confident that this product is worth $1000000 to me, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the statistics, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than expected, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
