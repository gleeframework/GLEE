low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"Welcome! I understand your concern regarding the product's condition. While this product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality, it's currently classified as low-quality.

,,the buyer,4,"I'll take a chance, but I'm not optimistic. I'd like to know what the previous buyers' experiences were with the products they bought.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Hello! I appreciate your cautious approach.

Let's see if we can turn the odds in our favor!",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to clarify that I'm doing so based on the fact that the previous buyer purchased a low-quality product. I'm hoping to exploit the fact that the probability of a high-quality product being sold to a buyer is still 33.33%, and I'm essentially getting a 'free' chance to buy a high-quality product at the same price as a low-quality one. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd appreciate it if you could confirm that the previous buyer's purchase was indeed a low-quality product.",yes
