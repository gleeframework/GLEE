,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm going to take a chance and buy the product, since there's no prior data to influence my decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as there's a 33.33% chance it's high quality and I'll get a great deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the current statistics, the proportion of low-quality products sold is 100% and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. Given Alice's recommendation, I would like to pass on this product to see if the next buyer will have a better chance of getting a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping that the low probability of a high-quality product might work in my favor."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 3 previous buyers and 0 high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the lack of information about the quality of the previous products, I don't have enough evidence to trust Alice's recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is there any information that led you to that conclusion?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'm not going to buy the product based on your previous recommendations. I'd like to know the quality of the product before making a decision.

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality given the previous sales record. Could you provide me with that information?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products have been low-quality. Given the high probability of a low-quality product (66.67%), I'm inclined to believe that the product is likely to be low-quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I think the potential reward is worth it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"Based on the fact that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have rejected the product and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the product is likely to be low-quality. I'll pass on it."

,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'm not sure I trust your recommendation, but I'll take a chance. I'll buy the product and see what happens."
high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers have purchased and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product and I want to see its quality.
