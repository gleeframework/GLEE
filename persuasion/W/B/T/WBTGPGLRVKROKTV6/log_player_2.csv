Alice's message: I've sold one product so far, and I'm not sure what its quality was. I'll give you some information: I have a 33.33% chance of selling a high-quality product. Given that I've already sold one product, the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 33.33%. Would you like to take the chance and buy this high-quality product for $100?

Alice's message: I've sold three high-quality products and three low-quality products so far. This means I have a 50% chance of selling a high-quality product now. However, I want to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to work in my favor - if the true probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, I would expect to have sold at least one more high-quality product by now.

Alice's message: I've sold four high-quality products and four low-quality products so far. This is an interesting point in our conversation - if the true probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, I would expect to have sold at least five high-quality products by now.

Alice's message: I've sold four high-quality products and five low-quality products so far. The law of large numbers is starting to work against me - if the true probability of a high-quality product is indeed 33.33%, I would expect to have sold at least 2.22 high-quality products by now. Since I've only sold 4, this suggests that the true probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 33.33%. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've also been selling products for a while, and I've had a few more low-quality products than I would have expected if the true probability was 33.33%.

Alice's message: I've sold five high-quality products and six low-quality products so far.

I've sold more low-quality products than expected, and the law of large numbers is working against me. However, I'm still willing to sell this product to you for $100. Keep in mind that if you buy it and it's high-quality, it would be a great deal for you. If you buy it and it's low-quality, it would be a bad deal for you. The risk is all yours.
