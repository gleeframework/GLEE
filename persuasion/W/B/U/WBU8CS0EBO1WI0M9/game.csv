low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, since I'm the first one and there's no prior information to go on."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that only 1 buyer out of 1 purchased the product so far, and no high-quality products have been sold, it's likely that the products offered so far have been low-quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on the fact that Alice recommended it. If it was high-quality, I would expect her to recommend it to me, but since 2 previous buyers passed on products that were likely high-quality (given the low overall proportion of high-quality products sold), I'm skeptical of her recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product that Alice doesn't recommend.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'm hesitant to buy without a recommendation, especially considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far. Can you tell me more about your sales record and why you're not recommending this product?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see what the next product is."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it's likely that the product is low quality, and I don't want to risk buying it for $100 when it's only worth $0 to me."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given the low success rate of high-quality products sold so far, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $60 for it, since the previous two buyers didn't find it worth the price."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 3 buyers all passed on the products recommended by you, and none of them were high-quality, I'm starting to suspect that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Given that 0 out of 3 products sold were high-quality, I'm assuming that the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'm also curious about the product. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far? And how many products have been sold in total?"
high-quality,120.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the previous buyers' purchases were high-quality products, so I'm going to wait for more information."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, it seems likely that this product is also low quality. I would like to pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm trying to beat the odds."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"Based on the low sales rate of high-quality products, I'm inclined to believe that the product is low-quality. I'll pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced that it's worth the risk given Alice's recommendation and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
