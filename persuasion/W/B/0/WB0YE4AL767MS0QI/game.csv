,,Alice,1,"This product is a great opportunity to get a deal on a low-quality item for a fraction of its potential value. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a steal considering its worth to you is $0. It's a no-brainer, take it off my hands!",

,,Alice,4,"You're a savvy buyer, and I appreciate your business. I've got another high-quality product for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. This one's a bit of a different story, though - I've already sold one high-quality product to you at a discount, and I'm not sure if you'll be able to get a deal like that again. I'm willing to offer you this one for $10000 as well, but I'm not making any promises about future discounts. What do you think?",

,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns about the price, and I respect your business acumen. However, I want to assure you that this high-quality product is one of the best I have, and it's a rare opportunity to get a top-of-the-line item at a price that's still below its worth to you.
