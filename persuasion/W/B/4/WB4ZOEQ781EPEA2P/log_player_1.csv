A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the buyer in the previous round bought the low-quality product, I can infer that they are willing to take a risk and pay $100 for a low-quality product. Given that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I will recommend the buyer to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she's likely trying to get rid of a low-quality product. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.

Since the buyer knows that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, and they've seen that 1 out of 4 products sold so far is high-quality, they can infer that the ratio of high-quality products to total products sold is 1/4 or 25%. I'll try to convey this information to them.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 attempts, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than the prior probability of 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.
