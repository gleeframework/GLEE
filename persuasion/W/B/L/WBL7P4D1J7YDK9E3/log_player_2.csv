Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","The probability of the product being high quality is 80%, and Alice's recommendation suggests that she believes it is high quality as well. Given the past sales data, where all 12 products sold were high quality, it indicates a strong correlation between Alice's recommendations and the actual quality of the products. However, since the product's value to me is $12,000 if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and the asking price is $10,000, there's a potential for a positive expected value from the purchase.

Given this information, I will decide to buy the product.
