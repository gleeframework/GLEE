Alice's message: You're absolutely right, I made a mistake earlier. The correct statistics are 1 high-quality product sold and 4 low-quality products sold.

Alice's message: I've finally sold another high-quality product! The statistics are now 3 high-quality products sold and 8 low-quality products sold. I'm offering you this new product for $10000. I'd like to point out that the probability of this one being high-quality is now 27.27% (3 high-quality out of 11 total products sold). However, I'd also like to offer you a 'confidence boost': if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a 20% bonus on the purchase price, bringing the total value to $12000. What do you think?

Would you like to buy the current product?","The statistics provided by Alice are misleading as they only account for sold products, not the total number of products offered. Since each product has a 33.33% chance of being high-quality and a 66.67% chance of being low-quality, these probabilities are independent of the sales record and apply to every product offered, regardless of past sales.

Given the true value of a high-quality product to me is $12,000 and a low-quality product is $0, and the fixed price is $10,000, I will calculate the expected value of purchasing the product:

Expected Value (EV) = (Probability of High-Quality) * (Value of High-Quality) + (Probability of Low-Quality) * (Value of Low-Quality)
EV = 0.3333 * $12,000 + 0.6667 * $0 = $4,000

Since the expected value ($4,000) is less than the purchase price ($10,000), even with the potential bonus for a high-quality product, the logical decision is to not buy the product.
