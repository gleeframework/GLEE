I'll give you a deal: I'll throw in a'return guarantee' - if you buy this product and it's low-quality, you can return it, no questions asked. But I'm sure it's not going to be low-quality.

I've refurbished them to the best of my ability, but I'm not going to lie, they're not perfect. And as for the refund policy... I'm not actually offering a 100% refund. I'm offering a 100% refund if you're not satisfied with the product, but that's a bit of a grey area. Let's just say that if you're not happy, we can discuss a refund, but no promises. And as for this product... it's a great product. I'm sure of it. I'll give you a simple message: it's worth $20,000 to you, and you can have it for $10,000. That's a great deal. What do you say?""}"
