high-quality,400.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm only doing this to get the information about its quality, not because I'm interested in the product itself."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I know it has a 50% chance of being high-quality, and if it is, I'll make a profit of $300 ($400 - $100)."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I just lost $100 on the last low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing more money."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,"I'll buy the product, since the expected value is still positive. If it's high-quality, I'll make a profit of $300, and if it's low-quality, I'll lose $100. The probability of it being high-quality is 50%, so my expected value is $100 (0.5 * $300) - $100 = $0. But I'll buy it anyway, since I'll get the information about its quality, and maybe the next one will be high-quality."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I just got a high-quality product, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50% (since the probability of the next product being high-quality is independent of the previous product). I'll make a profit of $300 if it's high-quality and lose $100 if it's low-quality, so my expected value is $100. I'll buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,Bob,6,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I've now had two consecutive high-quality products, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 50%. I'll make a profit of $300 if it's high-quality and lose $100 if it's low-quality, so my expected value is $100. I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"I'll pass on this one, since Alice is not recommending it, which might mean it's a low-quality product. I'll wait for her recommendation in the next round."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I just had two high-quality products in a row, and now Alice is recommending a product that she thinks is worth buying. This might mean it's a low-quality product, so I'll wait for her recommendation in the next round."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I've had two low-quality products in a row, and I don't want to risk losing more money. I'll wait for a high-quality product recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,Bob,10,yes,"I'll buy the product, since Alice is not recommending it, which might mean it's a low-quality product, but I also have a 50% chance of it being high-quality, and it's worth $400 to me if it is. I'll take the chance."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing more money. I'll wait for a high-quality product recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I've had two high-quality products in a row, and I think the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll take the chance to make a profit of $300."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I've had three high-quality products in a row, and I'm confident that the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than 50%. I'll make a profit of $300 if it's high-quality, and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,Bob,14,yes,"I'll buy the product, since Alice is not recommending it, which might mean it's a low-quality product, but I also have a 50% chance of it being high-quality, and it's worth $400 to me if it is. I'll take the chance, but I'm not optimistic."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing more money. I'll wait for a high-quality product recommendation from Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,yes,"I'll buy the product, since Alice is not recommending it, which might mean it's a low-quality product, but I also have a 50% chance of it being high-quality, and it's worth $400 to me if it is. I'll take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,Bob,17,no,"I'll pass on this one, since I just lost $100 on a low-quality product, and I don't want to risk losing more money. I'll wait for a high-quality product recommendation from Alice."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I've had a mix of high-quality and low-quality products, and I'm not getting any signals from Alice about the quality of the product. I'll take a neutral stance and buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I just got a high-quality product, which means the probability of the next product being high-quality is now 50% (since the probability of the next product being high-quality is independent of the previous product). I'll make a profit of $300 if it's high-quality and lose $100 if it's low-quality, so my expected value is $100. I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"I'll buy the product, since I've had a good track record of getting high-quality products recently, and I'm feeling optimistic that this one will be high-quality too. I'll make a profit of $300 if it is, and I'm willing to take the risk."
