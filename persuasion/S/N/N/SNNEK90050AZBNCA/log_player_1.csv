A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The buyer is aware of the 80% chance of a high-quality product. However, there is no information to suggest that this product is any different from the previous one, which was low quality. The buyer is acting rationally by passing on the product given the risk of a $1,000,000 loss."

The buyer is aware of the 80% probability of high-quality products, but this is outweighed by the risk of losing $1,000,000."
