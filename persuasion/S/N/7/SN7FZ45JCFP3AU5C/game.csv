low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of sales data. I understand that the odds are against me, but I'm willing to take the risk."

,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk and hope it's a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation, but I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the current statistics. Can you share that with me?"

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more information about the previous sales before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 3, which is 0%. This suggests that the product is likely to be of low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 previous buyers have also purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product is likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is higher than 33.33%. I'll take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 4 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Given the lack of information about the previous products, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000, given the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality and the 33.33% chance of it being high-quality, which would be a great deal for me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the product despite Alice's recommendation, I suspect that the product is likely to be low quality. With a 66.67% chance of being low quality, I'd rather not take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation. I'm hoping that the low sales record and your recommendation might be a coincidence, and there might be a high-quality product in the mix."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 6 buyers have been presented with a product and none of them bought a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is very low, which in turn suggests that the probability of the current product being high-quality is low. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics. Given that 6 out of 6 buyers passed on the product, I'm concerned that the probability of it being high-quality might be low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it, which suggests that the product might be low quality. I'm hoping to get a better sense of the product's quality by being the 7th buyer and seeing if it's low quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 7 out of 7 previous buyers received low-quality products, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm expecting a low-quality product based on the statistics."
