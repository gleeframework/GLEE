,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, a fair price considering its value to you is $125. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, so you're taking a risk, but I'm confident in the quality of this one.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take the risk and buy the product. Thank you, Alice!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and you know that's a small fraction of my total sales. Considering the odds are against me selling a high-quality product, I'm willing to offer this one to you for $100. It's a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",

You can either take the risk and buy it, or wait and see if the next product is high-quality.",

But I'm willing to offer this one to you for $100, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling it to you.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the risk and buy the product, but I want to know that you're aware that I'm doing this based on the statistics and your transparency. I'm hoping that the product is high-quality, but I'm also prepared for it to be low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a savvy buyer who's making an informed decision based on the stats. I appreciate your honesty.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",
,,the buyer,5,"I appreciate your honesty as well, Alice. I'll take the product, but I'm doing it because I think the odds are in my favor, not because I trust your recommendation.",yes

,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still a bit cautious. Given the statistics, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price slightly. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $90?",yes

But I'm not going to let my ego get the best of me. I'll be honest with you - I'm selling a low-quality product this time. It's a rare occurrence, but it's still a possibility. I'll sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a heads up: the odds are against it being high-quality. You can either take the risk or wait for the next product.",

If you're looking for a high-quality product, you should probably wait for the next one.",
