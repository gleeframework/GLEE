Alice's message: This is a rare opportunity to own a high-quality product! With 1 out of 2 products being high-quality, the chances are in your favor. I've sold 0 out of 1 products so far, and all of them have been high-quality. This is a great chance to get your hands on a product worth $12500 to you. Will you take the risk and buy it? The price is still $10000.
