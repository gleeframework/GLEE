Alice's message: I understand your concerns and willingness to make an informed decision. I appreciate your valuation of high-quality products at $12500 and low-quality products at $0. Given your indifference point at 50%, it's clear that you're looking for a more balanced decision. I'd be happy to provide more information about the previous sales record. As I mentioned earlier, 2 out of 5 products were high-quality, and 3 out of 5 products were low-quality.

Alice's message: I understand your request for the probability distribution of the remaining products. Given the previous sales record, we can estimate the probability of the current product being high-quality. Since 2 out of 5 products were high-quality, and 2 out of 5 products have been sold, we can assume that the remaining products are biased towards low-quality products. Let's assume that the remaining products are equally likely to be high-quality or low-quality. In that case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%.
