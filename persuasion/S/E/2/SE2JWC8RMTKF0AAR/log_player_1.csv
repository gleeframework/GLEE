I'd be happy to provide more information about the previous sales record. As I mentioned earlier, 2 out of 5 products were high-quality, and 3 out of 5 products were low-quality.

Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{""message"": ""I understand your request for the probability distribution of the remaining products.

Let's assume that the remaining products are equally likely to be high-quality or low-quality. In that case, the probability of the current product being high-quality is 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%.
