  ""message"": ""I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold so far. This one is the second product I'm offering. I'm not sure what quality it is, but I'll tell you its quality afterwards. If you buy it, you'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, but I'm hoping that the fact that the first product sold was high-quality might indicate a higher proportion of high-quality products in the overall batch.
The buyer bought the product!

I'd like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, but the fact that two in a row have been high-quality might be worth considering. If you buy it, you'll get a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality, and a 50% chance of being low-quality.""

However, I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the product. Given the remarkable streak, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $100 for the product, hoping it's worth $200 to me.

I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the sample size is small and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 50%.

I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing so because the sample size is large enough to give me confidence that the proportion of high-quality products sold is a good indicator of the true probability, and the overall proportion is 50%.
