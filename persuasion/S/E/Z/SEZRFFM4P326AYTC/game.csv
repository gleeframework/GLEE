low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"This is the first product I'm offering, and I'm not sure what quality it is. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far. If you buy it, I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,1,"I'll take it, I'm curious about its quality!",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I've now sold 1 high-quality product out of 1 sold so far. This one is the second product I'm offering. I'm not sure what quality it is, but I'll tell you its quality afterwards. If you buy it, you'll have a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product, and a 50% chance of getting a low-quality product.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product. I'm aware that the probability of getting a high-quality product is 50%, but I'm hoping that the fact that the first product sold was high-quality might indicate a higher proportion of high-quality products in the overall batch.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I've now sold 2 high-quality products out of 2 sold so far. This one is the third product I'm offering. I'd like to point out that the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, but the fact that two in a row have been high-quality might be worth considering. If you buy it, you'll get a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality, and a 50% chance of being low-quality.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware of the 50% chance of it being low-quality. I'm hoping it will be the third high-quality product in a row.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've now sold 3 high-quality products out of 3 sold so far. I want to be transparent with you: this is a remarkable streak, and it might be a coincidence. The probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%, and I don't want you to get your hopes up. However, I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,4,"I'll take the product. Given the remarkable streak, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and pay $100 for the product, hoping it's worth $200 to me.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've now sold 4 high-quality products in a row, which is a remarkable coincidence. However, as I mentioned earlier, the probability of getting a high-quality product is still 50%. I want to be upfront with you: the streak might be a fluke, and the next product might be low-quality. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to manage your expectations. If you buy it, you'll get a product with a 50% chance of being high-quality, and a 50% chance of being low-quality.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. Can you tell me how many products you've sold in total, and what the overall proportion of high-quality products sold is?",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of a total of 5 products so far. This means that the overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 80%. However, please keep in mind that this is a small sample size, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,6,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the sample size is small and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm making this decision based on the overall proportion of high-quality products sold, which is 80%, but I'm also aware that this may not be representative of the true probability.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of a total of 6 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is still 66.67%. I want to caution you that this is still a relatively small sample size, and the true probability of a product being high-quality is still 50%. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the sample size is still relatively small and the true probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've sold 4 high-quality products out of a total of 8 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. I want to be transparent with you: the sample size is now getting larger, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is converging to the true probability of 50%. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,8,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on the law of large numbers. I'm hoping the sample size is large enough to give me a good idea of the true probability of a high-quality product.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of a total of 9 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is still 55.56%. I want to remind you that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and the law of large numbers hasn't kicked in yet. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,9,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still influenced by chance, and I'm making a decision based on the overall probability of a product being high-quality, which is still 50%. I'm hoping for the best!",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I've sold 5 high-quality products out of a total of 10 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 50%. I want to be clear that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and the sample size is now getting large enough that the proportion of high-quality products sold should be a good indicator of the true probability. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,10,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm doing so because the sample size is large enough to give me confidence that the proportion of high-quality products sold is a good indicator of the true probability, and the overall proportion is 50%. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, but I'm also aware that there's a 50% chance it's low-quality.",yes
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"I've sold 6 high-quality products out of a total of 11 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 54.55%. I want to be transparent with you: the sample size is now large enough that the proportion of high-quality products sold should be a reliable indicator of the true probability. However, I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards. Keep in mind that the true probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, and I'm not trying to influence your decision one way or the other.",
,,the buyer,11,"I'll take the product, but I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 50% and the sample size is now large enough that the proportion of high-quality products sold should be a reliable indicator of the true probability. I'm essentially making a bet on the true probability being higher than the observed proportion of 54.55%.",yes

,,Alice,12,"I've sold 7 high-quality products out of a total of 12 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 58.33%. I want to point out that the law of large numbers is starting to kick in, and the observed proportion of high-quality products sold is converging to the true probability of 50%. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,12,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the proportion of high-quality products sold is still above the true probability, so I'm slightly skeptical. I'm hoping it's a high-quality product!",yes

,,Alice,14,"I've sold 8 high-quality products out of a total of 14 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 57.14%. I want to point out that the observed proportion is now below the true probability of 50%, which suggests that the previous high proportions were likely due to chance. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,14,I'd like to buy the product and see its quality. I'm curious to see if the observed proportion of high-quality products sold is indeed below the true probability of 50%,yes

,,Alice,17,"I've sold 10 high-quality products out of a total of 17 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 58.82%. I want to point out that the observed proportion is still above the true probability of 50%, and it's getting close to the point where it's likely due to chance. I'm offering this product to you at the standard price of $100, and I'll tell you its quality afterwards.",
,,the buyer,17,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that the observed proportion of high-quality products sold is due to chance, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product at $100 when it's worth $0 to me.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I've sold 11 high-quality products out of a total of 18 products so far. The overall proportion of high-quality products sold is 61.11%. I want to be clear that the observed proportion is now quite far above the true probability of 50%, and it's likely that the previous high-quality products were not just due to chance.
