,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,yes,I'll take a chance and buy it.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,yes,"I'll buy it, since the last one was high quality and I have a 80% chance of getting a high-quality product again."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,yes,I'll keep the streak going and buy it. Two high-quality products in a row is a good sign!
high-quality,400.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,Bob,4,yes,Three high-quality products in a row is a strong indication that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,Bob,5,yes,Four high-quality products in a row is a very strong indication that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"Alice's recommendation to not buy suggests that the product might be low-quality, so I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,Bob,7,yes,"One low-quality product in a row doesn't change my overall assessment of the high probability of getting a high-quality product, so I'll take the chance and buy it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,Bob,8,yes,"Back to back high-quality products, I'm feeling confident that the probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed higher than 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,Bob,9,yes,"Four high-quality products in a row, and two low-quality products in a row. I'm sticking with my initial assessment that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"Five high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice might be giving me a hint that the probability of getting a high-quality product is actually higher than 80%."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,Bob,11,yes,"Six high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice is actually telling me the truth about the high probability of getting a high-quality product, and I'll keep buying."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,Bob,12,yes,"Seven high-quality products in a row, I'm convinced that the probability of getting a high-quality product is indeed higher than 80%, and I'll continue to take advantage of this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,Bob,13,yes,"Eight high-quality products in a row, I'm extremely confident that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%, and I'll keep buying as long as Alice recommends it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Nine high-quality products in a row, I'm starting to think that Alice is not only telling the truth about the high probability of getting a high-quality product, but she's also being generous in her recommendations."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Ten high-quality products in a row, I'm not seeing any reason to stop now. I'll keep buying as long as Alice recommends it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,Bob,16,yes,"Eleven high-quality products in a row, I'm getting a little concerned that this is too good to be true, but I'll keep buying for now."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"Alice's recommendation to not buy suggests that the product might be low-quality, and I'm starting to question the probability of getting a high-quality product. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"One low-quality product in a row after 11 high-quality products in a row is a significant deviation from the expected probability, but I'll give Alice the benefit of the doubt and buy the product."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"Twelve high-quality products in a row after a single low-quality product, I'm starting to think that Alice's recommendations are not entirely random, and I'll continue to take advantage of this opportunity."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"Thirteen high-quality products in a row, I'm extremely confident that the probability of getting a high-quality product is higher than 80%, and I'll buy the last product of the game."
