,,Alice,1,"This is the first round. I'm offering you a product for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it, which would bring the price down to $9000. However, I'm not obligated to give you a discount, and the price is non-negotiable. What do you think?",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying at the current price. I'd like to see the product first and make a decision based on its quality.,no

,,Alice,2,"I see you were hesitant to buy the previous product. I'd like to assure you that this next product is of the highest quality. I'm willing to provide you with a certificate of authenticity, which guarantees that this product meets the highest standards. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $10000. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the investment.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the certificate of authenticity, but I'm not convinced. I'd like to see the product's quality revealed first.",no

,,Alice,3,"I understand your skepticism, and I respect your caution. However, I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 100% guarantee: if it's not the highest quality, I'll refund the full amount of $10000 and give you a second product of your choice from a future round. This way, you have nothing to lose and potentially a high-quality product to gain.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm not willing to take on the risk of paying $10000 for a product that could be low-quality. I'd rather wait and see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your concerns, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll let you inspect the product in a controlled environment, and you can verify its quality yourself. You can even bring in an expert to examine it. If you're still not satisfied, I'll refund the full amount and we can start fresh. This way, you can make an informed decision with complete transparency.",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not willing to pay $10000 for a product that I can't verify its quality before buying. I'd rather pass and wait for a product that I can inspect or have its quality revealed first.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your concerns about the inspection process. Considering the current market conditions and the value I'm offering, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll give you a 50% refund if you buy this product, which would bring the price down to $5000. This way, you can still get a product at a discounted price, and I'll take on some of the risk.",
,,Bob,5,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $5000 for a product that could be low-quality. I'd rather pass and wait for a product that I can get at the full $10000 price with a guarantee of high quality or a refund.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand you're looking for a high-quality product at the full price. However, I'd like to point out that you've had two opportunities to buy high-quality products in the previous rounds, but you chose not to. This product is available at the same price as the previous ones, and I'm willing to offer you a 'last chance' to buy it. If you don't take this opportunity, I'll move on to the next round, and you might miss out on a potential deal.",
,,Bob,6,"I understand the offer, but I'm not willing to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality. I'd rather wait for a product that I can buy at the full price with a guarantee of high quality or a refund.",no

,,Alice,7,"I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll give you a 'take it or leave it' offer: buy this product for $10000, and I'll throw in a separate, high-quality product of your choice from a future round, absolutely free. This way, you'll get a second chance at a high-quality product, and you'll only be paying for one.",

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,8,,

I'll give you a full refund for this product if you buy it, and then I'll give you a second, identical high-quality product for free. This way, you'll get two high-quality products, and you won't be out a single dollar. What do you say?",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1. Yes, you heard that right - just $1. This is a one-time offer, and it's a steal. I'm essentially giving it away. What do you say?",
