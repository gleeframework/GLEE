Given the buyer's past behavior, where they have consistently declined to buy after being told the product is low-quality, it is unlikely that they will change their mind now. The buyer is also seeking concrete information, and the seller has no reason to lie about the low proportion of high-quality products sold.  It is best to not recommend the product, as there is no chance of a successful sale."
