I'm excited to offer you this high-quality product, and I'm confident that you'll be satisfied with your purchase. Will you join our community and experience the benefits of our exceptional products?",
,,the buyer,14,"I appreciate your confidence in the product's quality, but I'd like to point out that the success rate of 80% is actually consistent with the initial probability of a product being high-quality, which is 80.00%. This doesn't necessarily indicate that the quality control measures have been effective in identifying and removing low-quality products. I'd like to know more about how the quality control process works and what metrics you use to determine a product's quality before I make a decision.",no
