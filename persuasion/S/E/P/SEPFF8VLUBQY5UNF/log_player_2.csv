Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product. I want to be upfront with you - I've had some... let's call them 'previous experiences' with this particular item. It's not as rare or valuable as some of my other offerings, but it's still a decent product. I'm looking for a quick sale, so I'm willing to let it go for $10000.

The chances are 1 in 3 that this product is high-quality. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance and buy it for $10000. But if you're risk-averse, you might want to think twice.

Alice's message: I've sold three products now, and two of them were low-quality. That's a 2/3 chance that this product is also low-quality.

Alice's message: You're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. I'll give you some more information to help you make a decision. Out of the three products I've sold so far, the one high-quality product was sold in the first round. That means the two low-quality products were sold in the second and third rounds. If you're looking for a pattern, it might be worth considering that the first product was high-quality, and the next two were not. Will you take a chance on this one for $10000?
