high-quality,125.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'm hoping to get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation. I've seen that 1 out of 1 high-quality products was sold, which is a 100% success rate. I'm hoping to replicate that luck."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I think it's more likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm doing it because I think the proportion of high-quality products might be higher than 33.33% due to the limited sample size, and I'm hoping to be the one who gets the high-quality product."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I want to see more data before making a purchase decision. Can you tell me the proportion of high-quality products sold so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next product is any better."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the low success rate of high-quality products sold, I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not going to buy it, based on your previous sales record, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 1/3. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I think it's not worth the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I don't think it's a good idea to discard a potential high-quality product based on your recommendation. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I want to see for myself if it's high quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that you recommended it and only 1 high-quality product was sold out of 5. This suggests a high probability of the product being low-quality."
high-quality,125.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics before making a decision.
high-quality,125.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of five, the probability of this product being high-quality is still relatively low. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase decision."
