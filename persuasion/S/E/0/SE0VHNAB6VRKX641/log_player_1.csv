}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency and the buy-it-now offer. I'm willing to take a chance on this product because of the refund guarantee.  It's a good deal for me, as I have nothing to lose but the opportunity cost of waiting for another product.

}"
"The buyer's message: Alice, your track record suggests that there is a higher chance of getting a low-quality product.

}"
