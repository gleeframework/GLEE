Alice's message: I see what you're getting at, and I appreciate your skepticism. I can tell you that the first buyer did indeed buy a high-quality product, and the second buyer passed on a low-quality product. The third buyer, who just bought from me, also got a high-quality product. So, it seems that I've had a bit of a streak of selling high-quality products, but I'm not trying to hide anything from you. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm confident that it's also high-quality. I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 6 total, which is an 66.67% success rate.

Alice's message: I understand your desire for a probability calculation. Let's break it down: I've sold 4 high-quality products out of 7 total, which is a 57.14% success rate. However, you're right to consider the streak of high-quality products sold. If I were randomly selling products, the probability of getting 4 high-quality products in a row would be (1/3)^4 = 1/81. This is a very low probability, suggesting that the streak is unlikely to be due to chance. Taking this into account, I'd estimate the probability of the next product being high-quality to be around 40%. I'm offering this next product to you for $100, and I'm willing to let you take a chance on it.
