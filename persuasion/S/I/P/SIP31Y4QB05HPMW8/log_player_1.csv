Round 10
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 
Here's why:

Even though Bob has seen nine low-quality products in a row, the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33%.  Since a high-quality product is worth $1,250,000 to Bob, the potential gain outweighs the risk of getting another low-quality product. 

This is a classic example of the gambler's fallacy â€“ the belief that past events influence future independent events. In this case, each product's quality is independent of the previous ones."

* **Probability:** Even with the recent positive experience, the probability of a high-quality product remains at 33.33%. This means the odds are still in Bob's favor. 
* **Value:**  A high-quality product brings a significant profit to Bob.

This is a situation where Bob might be leaning towards a ""wait-and-see"" approach, but given the potential reward and the consistent 33.33% chance of a high-quality product, recommending a purchase remains the best strategy."
