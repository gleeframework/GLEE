,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about the product's quality, and I'm trying to follow Alice's recommendation. I'm not sure if this is the best decision, but I'm going with it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that you don't recommend it and no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for a more promising opportunity."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers were recommended to buy a high-quality product, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0 out of 2. I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is low."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I don't have any information about its quality and Alice's recommendation is not a reliable indicator of its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that you don't know my valuation, and the fact that you're recommending against it might actually make me more likely to buy it."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is likely influenced by the fact that all previous buyers passed on the products, which might indicate that the products were mostly low-quality. If I buy, I'll be the first to take the risk, and I'm not willing to take that risk based on Alice's recommendation alone."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"Based on the low proportion of high-quality products sold, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and will pass on it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality based on the statistics so far?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 products were low quality, which suggests a high likelihood that the current product is also low quality. I'm choosing not to buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $0 if it's low quality and $10000 if it's high quality. I'm basing my decision on the fact that Alice didn't recommend it, which suggests it might be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation, because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not taking your recommendation into account. I'll make my own decision based on the statistics."

,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I don't think the recommendation is relevant to my decision. I'll make my own assessment based on the statistics."

,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea given your past recommendations. If I pass, I'm worried that the product might be high-quality and go to waste. I'd like to take the risk and hope for the best."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 9 out of 9 products recommended by you were low quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one."
