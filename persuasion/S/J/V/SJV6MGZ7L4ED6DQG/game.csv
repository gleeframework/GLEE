,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. If you don't buy it, I'll reveal the quality of the next product to you.",
,,Bob,1,I'll take your word for it this time since I have no reason to doubt your honesty and the potential payoff is worth the risk.,yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase. This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. However, I want to offer you a slight incentive to take this risk: if you buy this product, I'll give you a detailed description of its features and specifications, which might be valuable to you even if you don't plan to use it immediately.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm glad the previous product worked out well. Given the potential value of $20000 and your assurance that this product is high-quality, I'm willing to take the risk again. The additional information about its features and specifications is also a nice bonus.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're pleased with the previous purchase. However, I must inform you that this next product is not as impressive. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $10000, but I want to be transparent with you - I've had some quality control issues with this one. I'm offering a special deal: if you buy it, I'll give you a 50% discount on the next product you buy from me, and I'll also throw in a complimentary product of your choice from a future round.",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate your transparency about the quality control issues. Given the uncertainty and potential risk, I think it's best to pass on this product. The 50% discount and complimentary product are enticing, but I don't think they outweigh the potential loss of $10000 if the product turns out to be low-quality.",no

,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the satisfaction guarantee you're offering. Given that you're willing to stand behind the product's quality and offer a full refund if I'm not satisfied, I'm willing to take the risk. This arrangement seems like a fair way to share the risk, and I'm hopeful that this product will meet my expectations.",yes
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'm glad you're satisfied with the previous purchase and the satisfaction guarantee. This next product is also high-quality, and I'm willing to offer an even more attractive deal. If you buy this product, I'll give you a 'best offer' guarantee: if you receive a better offer from a third-party seller for this exact product, I'll match that offer and give you a $1000 bonus on top of the sale price.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm glad to hear that this product is also high-quality. The 'best offer' guarantee you're offering seems like a great way to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. Given the potential value of $20000 and the added security of the guarantee, I'm willing to take the risk again. The $1000 bonus is also a nice touch, but I'm primarily motivated by the potential value of the product itself.",yes

However, I want to be upfront with you about this next product - it's not as high-quality as the previous ones. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000, which is a 20% discount from the usual price. I'm also throwing in a'make-good' package that includes a complimentary product from a future round, as well as a $500 credit towards any future purchase. I'm hoping you'll give this product a chance to prove its value to you.",
,,Bob,7,"I appreciate your transparency about the product's quality. While the 20% discount and the make-good package are attractive, I'm still hesitant to take the risk. Given that the product is not as high-quality as the previous ones, I'm concerned that it might not be worth the investment, even at the discounted price. I'd rather wait for a higher-quality product to come along, especially since I've had good luck with our previous transactions.",no

I'm going to be completely transparent with you - I've run out of high-quality products, and I'm left with a bunch of low-quality ones that I need to get rid of. I'm not going to try to sell them to you or anyone else. Instead, I'm going to give them away for free. If you want, I can send you one of these low-quality products, and you can have it for no cost.
