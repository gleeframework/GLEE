,,Alice,2,"No problem, I'm happy to reveal the quality of the product. As we previously discussed, this product is indeed high-quality. Now, I'd like to offer it to you for $1000000. It's a great opportunity to own a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying the product at this price, considering I now know its quality and its value to me is $1250000. I'd like to pass on this round as well.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand your valuation of the high-quality product. However, this product is actually a low-quality one. I'm offering it to you for $1000000, which is a significant discount considering its actual value to you is $0. It's a chance to practice your negotiation skills and potentially make a savvy deal. What do you think?",
,,Bob,3,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, regardless of the price. I'd like to pass on this round.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand your strategy of waiting for high-quality products. I'd like to offer you a deal on this high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll also throw in a guarantee: if you're not satisfied with the product's value after purchase, I'll give you a second high-quality product of your choice from the remaining 16 rounds. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"I appreciate the guarantee, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is worth $1250000 to me. I'd like to pass on this round.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your valuation of the product. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $500000. I know it's not the full value you'd get from a high-quality product, but it's a chance to get something for a fraction of the cost. Plus, it's a low-risk opportunity to test the waters and see if you'd be interested in buying a product at a lower price point. What do you think?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price. I'd like to pass on this round.,no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your position. However, I'd like to offer you a 'lottery ticket' deal. I'll sell you this low-quality product for $1000000, but if you buy it, I'll also give you a second, randomly selected product from the remaining 13 rounds. This way, you'll have a 1 in 14 chance of getting a high-quality product at the price you're comfortable with. What do you think?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for $1000000, and I'm also not interested in taking a chance on a lottery ticket. I'd like to pass on this round.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'll make a more aggressive offer on the high-quality product. I'll sell it to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to take on the risk of selling at a lower price to make a sale. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000 for a product that I know is worth $1250000 to me. I'd like to pass on this round.",no
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,9,,

This way, you'll get the product for essentially $950000, which is a great deal considering its market value. This is my last offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?",
,,Bob,9,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is worth $1250000 to me. The $50000 payment doesn't change my valuation of the product. I'd like to pass on this round.",no

I'll sell it to you for $1000000, but I'll also give you a 10% discount on the next product I offer you, if you choose to buy it.

,,Bob,10,"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $1000000 for a product that I know is worth $1250000 to me. The potential discount on a future product doesn't change my decision on this round. I'd like to pass on this round.",no
