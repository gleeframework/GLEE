,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you're interested in the product! However, I want to be upfront with you - I've already sold one product to a customer who took a chance, and it was not of high quality. I'm not trying to mislead you, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risk. If you're still interested, I'll offer it to you for the same price of $1000000.",

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're interested in this product! I want to assure you that I've sold two products so far, and one of them was indeed of high quality. I'm confident that this product meets the same standards. However, I also want to be transparent about the fact that two out of three products I've sold so far were not of high quality. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, and I'm willing to provide a full refund if you're not satisfied with its quality.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I've sold three products so far, and two of them were not of high quality. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you, but I think it's worth noting that the ratio of low-quality to high-quality products seems to be skewed. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, but I want to ask you: are you willing to take a chance on a product from a seller who has a 66.67% chance of selling a low-quality product?",
,,the buyer,4,"I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I'll make my decision based on the probability of it being high-quality. Given the statistics you provided, I'll calculate the probability of the product being high-quality as 33.33%. I'll take the product if it's high-quality, and pass if it's low-quality.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I see you're a savvy buyer who's doing your math! I appreciate your honesty. I'll give you the same probability-based perspective: with 3 low-quality products out of 5, the probability of this product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether that's a risk you're willing to take. If you're interested, I'll sell it to you for $1000000.",
,,the buyer,5,"I'll take the product, but I'm doing the math in my head, and I'm willing to take the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product for $1000000. I'm hoping I get lucky!",yes

,,Alice,6,"Congratulations to the previous buyer on their calculated risk! I'm glad to report that this next product is indeed of high quality. With 2 high-quality products out of 6 sold, the probability of this product being high-quality is now 33.33%.

,,the buyer,6,I'd like to take the calculated risk and buy the product. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I've sold 7 products so far, with 2 of them being high-quality. I want to acknowledge that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that the previous buyer just paid $900000 for a high-quality product, which suggests that the value of a high-quality product to you might be higher than the asking price. I'm offering this product to you for $1000000, but I'm willing to negotiate if you're willing to take the risk.",
,,the buyer,7,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to negotiate the price. Based on the previous buyer's willingness to pay $900000 for a high-quality product, I'm willing to pay $2400000 for this product. I think this is a fair price considering the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm impressed by your negotiation skills! I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for a high-quality product. However, I want to be transparent with you that the previous buyer's willingness to pay $900000 for a high-quality product was a one-time deal, and I'm not sure if that's a reliable benchmark for future sales. Nevertheless, I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'll throw in a unique guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice from my next 10 sales.

,,Alice,10,"I've sold 10 products so far, with 4 of them being high-quality. I want to acknowledge that the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, I'd like to point out that the previous buyer just paid $900000 for a high-quality product, and another buyer just paid $1000000 for a product with a similar guarantee. I'm starting to think that the value of a high-quality product to you might be even higher than we initially thought. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1200000, but I'll throw in an additional guarantee: if you buy this product and it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund and throw in a second product of your choice from my next 10 sales, plus a third product of your choice from my next 10 sales.",
