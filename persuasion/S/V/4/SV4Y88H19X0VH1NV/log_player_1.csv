"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are Alice, and you know the product is high-quality. Bob knows that 80% of products are high-quality.  

* **Expected Value for Bob:**
    * If Bob buys a high-quality product, he gains $120 - $100 = $20.
    * If Bob buys a low-quality product, he loses $100.
    * Since the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, his expected value is: (0.8 * $20) + (0.2 * -$100) = $16 - $20 = -$4. 

* **Decision:** Even though Bob's expected value is slightly negative, the current product is high-quality.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy the product since he'll gain $20."
