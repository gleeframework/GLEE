Alice's message: You've just seen a buyer purchase a product for $1000000 and it turned out to be high-quality. That's 1 out of 1 so far. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000 as well. You can either take the chance or wait for more information.

Alice's message: You've seen 2 out of 2 high-quality products sold so far. Given the probability of 80% for a high-quality product, it's likely that I'm selling a high-quality product again. However, I want to be transparent with you - I've sold 2 out of 2 products so far, which is higher than the expected 80% success rate. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I want to give you a slight discount to reflect the slight deviation from the expected probability. I'll sell it to you for $900000.

Alice's message: You've seen 3 out of 3 high-quality products sold so far, which is significantly higher than the expected 80% success rate. I want to be upfront with you - this is getting suspicious. I'm willing to sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a clear warning: if this product is high-quality, I'll be surprised. I'm essentially offering you a chance to bet against the probability, but keep in mind that the expected value is still $1000000, even if it's a low-quality product.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. I want to assure you that I'm not trying to deceive you. I'll give you a chance to reassess the situation. Since you've seen 3 high-quality products in a row, the probability of a high-quality product is now higher than 80% (you can do the math). I'll sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll also offer you a'reset' option: if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll give you a refund of $200000. This way, you'll essentially get a 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product at the original price, or a 100% chance of getting a high-quality product at $800000. What do you say?

Alice's message: You've just taken advantage of the'reset' option and got a high-quality product, which is worth $2000000. I'm glad I could offer you a good deal. Now, let's get back to the regular sales. With 4 high-quality products out of 4 sold, the probability of a high-quality product is now even higher than before. However, I want to give you a chance to think about it. I'll offer you a'reverse auction': I'll start at $1000000, and with each passing second, the price will decrease by $10000. If you're interested, you can buy the product at the current price. If not, you can walk away. The price will keep decreasing until you buy or until it reaches $0.

Alice's message: I appreciate your clarification and willingness to take the risk. Given the sequence of 6 high-quality products in a row, I've calculated the probability of this happening by chance to be extremely low (less than 1%). I'm starting to suspect that I may have been selling a sequence of high-quality products, but I still don't know why. I'll sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a'conditional offer': if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll provide you with a detailed explanation of my sales data and a breakdown of the probability calculations.

As promised, I'll provide you with a detailed explanation. Based on the sequence of 7 high-quality products in a row, I've run simulations and calculated the probability of this happening by chance to be less than 0.01%. I've also analyzed my sales data and noticed that the probability of a high-quality product has been consistently higher than expected, even before the sequence started. I'm starting to suspect that I may have been intentionally selling high-quality products, but I still don't know why. I'll sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a'final warning': if you buy this product and it's high-quality, I'll reveal the truth behind my sales data and provide a full explanation. If it's low-quality, I'll admit that I've been selling a sequence of high-quality products and provide a full refund. This is your last chance to make an informed decision.

I've been selling high-quality products to the first 8 buyers, and then I'll start selling low-quality products to the remaining buyers. I'll sell this next product to you for $1000000, but I'll give you a'fair warning': this is the last high-quality product I have. After this, the products will be low-quality, and I'll be transparent about it. You can either take the risk and buy the product, or you can walk away and avoid the disappointment.
