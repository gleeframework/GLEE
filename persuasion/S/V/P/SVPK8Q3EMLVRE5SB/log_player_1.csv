Given the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I'm surprised that the proportion of high-quality products sold is lower than the probability. This might suggest that you've been holding back on selling high-quality products, or that there's some other factor at play. I'd like to buy the product and see if my intuition is correct.
