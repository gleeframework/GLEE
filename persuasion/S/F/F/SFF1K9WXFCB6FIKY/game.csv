,,Alice,1,"This product is a one-time offer at a special price of $100, but I'll give you a hint: it's not worth it to me, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to make some space in my inventory. Would you like to take a chance?",

high-quality,400.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you were cautious last round! As for this one, I can confidently say that it's a premium product, and I'm only selling it to you because I want to make room for new inventory. I'm offering it to you at a price that's a fraction of its true value, but I'm willing to make a deal. Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity?",
,,Bob,2,"I'm skeptical about your claims of it being a premium product. Since you know its true value, I'm not sure why you'd be willing to sell it for $100 if it's truly worth more. Can you give me a hint about its quality, or is this another low-quality product?",no

It's a no-lose situation for you.",
,,Bob,5,"I'm not looking to get rid of space in my inventory, and I'm not interested in taking on a product that's not worth much to me. I'd rather not spend $100 on something that's essentially worthless to me.",no
