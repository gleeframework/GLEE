**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point from previous sales, making it hard to assess the reliability of Alice's recommendations.
* **High Potential Reward:**  A high-quality product is worth $120 to you, while a low-quality product is worth $0.  Even with the 50/50 odds, the potential reward outweighs the risk.
* **Alice's Incentive:**  Alice is likely to recommend products she believes are high-quality, as she gets paid when a sale is made. This aligns with your goal of getting a high-quality product. 

**Overall:**  The limited information makes it a gamble, but the potential for a high reward makes buying the product the better choice."
