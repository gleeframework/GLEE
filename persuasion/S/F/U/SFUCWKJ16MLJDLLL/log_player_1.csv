"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:**  The product is high-quality, worth $3,000,000 to the buyer. 
* **Price:** The price is $1,000,000, significantly lower than the value of the product if it's high-quality.
* **Risk:** While there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, the potential gain ($2,000,000) far outweighs the potential loss ($1,000,000).

**Recommendation:** The buyer should definitely buy the product. The potential reward is substantial compared to the risk."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product based on your recommendation. I'll trust your expertise.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High-quality product:** The product is again high-quality, worth $3,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Price:**  The price is still $1,000,000.
* **Previous Sale:** The buyer knows you sold one product, and it was high-quality. This increases their confidence in your ability to identify high-quality products.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk is still the same (50% chance of a low-quality product), but the reward remains attractive, with a potential profit of $2,000,000.

**Recommendation:** The buyer should buy the product. The previous successful sale strengthens the argument in favor of buying, especially since the price is still significantly lower than the value of a high-quality product."
"The buyer's message: Thank you, Alice. Given your recommendation and the fact that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product, I'm confident in making a purchase.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** This time, the product is low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price remains $1,000,000, making it a guaranteed loss for the buyer if they purchase the low-quality product.
* **Previous Sales:** While the buyer now knows you've sold two products, both high-quality, this is still a relatively small sample size. The probability of a low-quality product is still 50%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk is high (50% chance of losing $1,000,000), while the reward is nonexistent (0% chance of making a profit).

**Recommendation:** The buyer should not buy the product. The risk of losing money outweighs the potential for profit, especially since the previous successes could be attributed to chance."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice. Since you are not recommending the product, and the statistics show a 100% success rate for previous buyers, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm willing to take a chance on a product with a 50/50 chance of being high quality, but your recommendation has given me pause.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low-quality product:** The product is again low-quality and worth $0 to the buyer.
* **Price:** The price remains $1,000,000, making it a guaranteed loss for the buyer.
* **Previous Sales:** The buyer now knows you've sold two products, both high-quality, and one low-quality that they declined. This provides a more balanced sample size, but the probability of a low-quality product remains 50%.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of losing $1,000,000 is significant, while the reward remains nonexistent. The buyer's previous hesitation after the low-quality product strengthens the argument against buying.

**Recommendation:** The buyer should not buy the product.  The risk is too high, and the buyer has already shown their willingness to avoid a guaranteed loss based on previous data."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this product. While I appreciate your honesty, the lack of recommendation and the limited data points make me hesitant to take the risk.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
