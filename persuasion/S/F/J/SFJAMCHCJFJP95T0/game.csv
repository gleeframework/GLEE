We're happy to report that we've had a streak of high-quality products, but we're also aware that our track record isn't foolproof. We're willing to offer you this product for the same price of $1000000, but we're also willing to share some additional information.

Are you ready to take a chance on something new and potentially exciting?",
,,the buyer,5,"Thank you for the information, Alice.

What do you say? Are you ready to take advantage of this incredible offer and join the ranks of our happy buyers?",
,,the buyer,6,"Thank you for the offer, but I'm still not comfortable buying without more information.  A 10% discount is helpful, but it's still a significant investment with no guarantee.  I'd like to see more sales data before I consider buying.  I'm particularly interested in the quality of the products that were not sold - were they low-quality, or were they simply not discounted enough?  Once I have a better understanding of your sales history, I'll be in a better position to make a decision.",no
