The previous results are just a coincidence. I'm confident that this product is high-quality and will meet your expectations. Consider buying it and breaking the cycle of mistrust.""}"
"The buyer's message: Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the products, it's likely that all of them received low-quality products.

However, the probability of at least one of the previous products being high-quality is 1 - 0.0625 = 0.9375.
