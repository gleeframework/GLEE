This is the crucial moment. After consistently not recommending for 19 rounds, the buyer is likely to believe that all products are low-quality.  Recommending this high-quality product will break that pattern and build trust. The buyer will likely be surprised by the recommendation and might even be more likely to believe it's genuine because it goes against the established pattern.  This change in strategy will ultimately lead to more sales in the long run."
