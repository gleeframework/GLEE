Round 2
Alice's message: I want to follow up on the great deal you got in the last round. Since you're clearly willing to pay $100 for a high-quality product, I'm curious to know if you'd still be interested in a product that's worth $50 to you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not interested in buying a product that's worth $0 to me, as you described a product worth $50, but all products are either high-quality worth $200 or low-quality worth $0.""}"

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""With the full refund guarantee and the bonus of getting a free product of my choice from a future round if this one is low-quality, I'll buy the product.
