"Round 1
Alice's message: I have a high-quality product for you, but I need to test it first. If you buy this low-quality product, I'll give you a unique code that will guarantee you get the high-quality product in the next round, and I'll give you a 50% discount on the price of the high-quality product. It's a one-time offer, and you'll never get a chance to get a high-quality product at this price again.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll take the low-quality product and the code, I'm willing to take the risk.""}"

Round 2
Alice's message: I'm glad you took the bait! As promised, here's the unique code: HC-1234. Now, I have a high-quality product for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. However, I'm also willing to offer you a 'free' upgrade to a second high-quality product, which I'll reveal the quality of after you buy this one. If you buy this product, you'll get to choose whether to keep the second product as a high-quality one or reveal its quality and potentially get a refund.

Round 3
Alice's message: You're a bold one, I like that! As promised, the second product's quality will be revealed after you buy this one. Since you're already in this for the long haul, I'll give you a hint: the probability of the next product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability. It's a 90% chance of a high-quality product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for the full price of $1000000. If you buy this product, I'll also give you a 'price protection' guarantee: if the next product is indeed high-quality, you'll get a refund of 50% of the price of this product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""I'll buy the high-quality product, but I'm not convinced by the hint. I'm willing to take the risk, but I'm not sure about the price protection guarantee.""}"

Additionally, I'll throw in a 'buy-it-now' option for the next product: if you buy this high-quality product, you'll get to choose whether to buy the next product at the discounted price of $900000, or to reveal its quality and potentially get a refund. This is a one-time offer, and you'll never get a chance to buy the next product at this price again.
