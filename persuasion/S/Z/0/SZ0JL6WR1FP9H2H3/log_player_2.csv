**Reasoning:**

* **High probability of high quality:**  Since one out of one sold products was high quality, there's a strong indication that the current product is also likely high quality. Even though it's a small sample size, it's a better signal than simply relying on the overall 33.33% probability.
* **Alice's incentive:** Alice has an incentive to recommend products that will be bought. Since she knows the value of each product, it's likely that she wouldn't recommend a low-quality product if she knew it would be rejected.

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on limited information. It's a gamble, and there's still a chance the product is low quality."
