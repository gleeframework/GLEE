Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer has no information about this specific product.** 
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 
* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.** 
* **The price is $10,000.** 

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

Since the expected value is equal to the price, it's a neutral situation.  However, since there's a chance of getting a $10,000 profit, it's generally advisable to **recommend buying** in such a scenario."
"The buyer's message: Since this is the first sale and there's no data to go by, I'll trust your recommendation and buy the product.  Let's hope it's high quality!

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

While the expected value is still equal to the price, the buyer now has more information suggesting a high probability of a high-quality product. Therefore, it's still advisable to **recommend buying.**"

* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.**

**Explanation:**

* **The buyer now knows that you sold three products, all of which were high-quality.** This means you have a 100% success rate for high-quality products.
* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 
* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.** 
* **The price is $10,000.** 

However, this time the product is **low-quality**.  While the buyer may be expecting a high-quality product based on the previous sales, the reality is different.  

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $0) + (0.5 * $20,000) = $10,000

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 
* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.** 
* **The price is $10,000.** 

However, this time the product is **low-quality**.  The buyer is likely to be suspicious given the high success rate in the past and your recommendation not to buy. 

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $0) + (0.5 * $20,000) = $10,000

The expected value is still equal to the price, but since the product is low-quality, **it's not advisable to recommend buying.**  The buyer's suspicion is justified in this case."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Given your recommendation and the fact that all three previous buyers purchased high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one.  I'm assuming the odds are now heavily in favor of a low-quality product.

* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.** 
* **The price is $10,000.** 

This time the product is **high-quality**.  While the buyer may be skeptical due to the recent low-quality products, the underlying probability of a high-quality product is still 50%. 

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

The expected value is still equal to the price, but since the product is high-quality, **it's advisable to recommend buying.**  It's important to remember that the buyer's past experience is not always a reliable indicator of the current product's quality."

* **The buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%.** 
* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.**

* **A high-quality product is worth $20,000 to the buyer, and a low-quality product is worth $0.**

This time the product is **high-quality**.  The buyer may be hesitant due to the recent low-quality products and the fact that your success rate has dropped back to the base probability, but the actual quality of the product is good.

Therefore, the expected value of buying the product is:

(0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000

The expected value is still equal to the price, but since the product is high-quality, **it's advisable to recommend buying.**  It's important to remember that the buyer's past experience is not always a reliable indicator of the current product's quality, and the underlying probability remains at 50%."

(0.5 * $0) + (0.5 * $20,000) = $10,000

The expected value is still equal to the price, but since the product is low-quality, **it's not advisable to recommend buying.**  The buyer's past experience is not a guarantee of future product quality, and the underlying probability remains at 50%."
