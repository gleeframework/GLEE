"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of Information:**  Alice's recommendation is valuable. Even though the product has a 80% chance of being high-quality, Alice's recommendation adds additional information, likely increasing the probability of a good product. 
* **Potential Profit:** Since the product is worth $12,000 if high quality and the price is only $10,000, there's a potential profit of $2,000.  The risk of a low-quality product is outweighed by the potential reward. 

**Note:** This is a simple strategy.  In a more complex game, you might want to track Alice's recommendations over time to see if they are accurate and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Track Record:** Alice's recommendation was accurate in the previous round. This suggests she might have some insight into product quality.
* **Negative Recommendation:** Her lack of recommendation suggests she believes the product is likely low quality.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's still a chance it could be high quality, the risk of getting a worthless product is too high given the potential loss of $10,000. 

This strategy assumes Alice is trying to help you make a good deal, but it's always possible her recommendations could be random or even deceptive.  In a more complex game, you might want to track Alice's recommendations over time to see if they are accurate and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Track Record:**  Alice has been accurate with her recommendations so far (one correct, one incorrect). This suggests she has some level of insight into product quality.
* **Potential Profit:** The potential profit of $2,000 still exists, making it worth the risk, especially considering Alice's previous accuracy.
* **Learning:**  By continuing to buy products, even when there's a risk, you can learn more about Alice's recommendation patterns and refine your strategy for future rounds.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the assumption that Alice is trying to help you.  If there's a possibility her recommendations are random or deceptive, a more cautious strategy might be needed."

* **Negative Recommendation:** Her lack of recommendation, combined with her recent mixed performance, strongly suggests that this product is likely low quality.
