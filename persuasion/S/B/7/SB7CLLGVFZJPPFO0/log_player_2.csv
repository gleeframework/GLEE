Alice's message: I completely understand your cautious approach! As you requested, I'd like to provide some insight into the products that were passed on. Out of the 2 products that were declined, 1 was high-quality and 1 was low-quality. This means that the proportion of high-quality products among the declined products is 50%.

Alice's message: I'm glad you're taking the chance! As for the 4th product, I'd like to share that it was the low-quality product from Round 3. Despite being low-quality, the buyer still took the chance and purchased it. This shows that even with imperfect information, some buyers are willing to take calculated risks. With that in mind, I'd like to reiterate that the current product has a 50% chance of being high-quality. However, considering the overall trend and the fact that 3 out of the 4 products sold so far have been high-quality, it's worth considering that the current product might have a higher chance of being high-quality than the overall average.
