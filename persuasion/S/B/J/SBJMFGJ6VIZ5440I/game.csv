high-quality,30000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers bought the product after your recommendation, I'm starting to suspect that the products Alice is recommending are actually low-quality. I'd like to see more information or a different approach before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the fact that 3 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, I'm not convinced by the statistics and I think I might get lucky."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have also received a recommendation to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being sold. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased high-quality products, I suspect that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers have received a recommendation to buy and no high-quality products have been sold, I suspect that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. This suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality may be lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the pattern continues."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. However, I'm a bit concerned that 4 out of 4 buyers have passed on the product, which suggests a high likelihood of low-quality products. I'll wait for the next one."

,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it's likely that the remaining products are low-quality. I'd rather not risk wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous 4 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products may be lower than 50%, and I'd rather wait for a more favorable situation."

,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the statistics show 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which might indicate that the products are more likely to be low-quality.
