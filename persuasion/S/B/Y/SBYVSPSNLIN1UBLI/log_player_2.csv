"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the true value of each product and is recommending you buy it, it's likely that the product is high quality.  While there's still a 50% chance it could be low quality, the potential reward of $12,500 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the most valuable information in this game. Since she knows the true quality and is *not* recommending the product, it's highly likely that it's low quality. The potential loss of $10,000 for a product worth $0 is a risk not worth taking."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one as well.  Thanks for the heads-up.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has a history of accurately predicting low-quality products. Since she's again not recommending this product, it's likely low quality. The potential loss outweighs the potential gain."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 4
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass.  I'm starting to feel like there's a pattern here.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's advice was wrong in this round, it's still valuable to consider. Her recommendations have been accurate in most cases, making it likely that the product is low-quality. The risk of losing $10,000 outweighs the potential reward of $12,500, especially given the recent pattern."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to get a little frustrated with this.  I'm going to pass on this one as well.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is becoming more inconsistent. However, her advice was correct in the majority of cases. As a risk-averse player, I'm choosing to stick with the strategy that has worked best so far. The risk of losing $10,000 is still too high given the uncertainty."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one.  Alice, I'm starting to think your recommendations aren't as reliable as they initially seemed.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record has become very unreliable.  She has now given incorrect advice on three consecutive rounds, making her recommendations essentially useless. I'm not willing to risk $10,000 on a product that could be worth $0 based on a recommendation that has proven to be unreliable.  I'll stick to my decision to avoid products Alice doesn't recommend."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm not going to buy this.  Alice, your advice has been consistently wrong for several rounds.  I'm going to rely on my own judgment from now on.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is abysmal at this point.  She has given incorrect advice for six consecutive rounds. While it's possible that she might be giving genuine advice, her track record has proven that her recommendations are unreliable. It's best to rely on my own judgement from now on, as the risk of losing money on low-quality products is too high."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your advice has been consistently wrong for several rounds.  I'm not going to buy this product.  I'm relying on my own judgement now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record has been terrible for quite a while.  While this time her advice might be correct, it's no longer worth trusting. The potential loss of $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $12,500, especially given how unreliable Alice has become. I'm going to rely on my own judgement from now on."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm not going to buy this.  I'm relying on my own judgement now. Your advice has been consistently wrong for too long.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice has been demonstrably unreliable for several rounds now.  It's impossible to know whether her current recommendation is accurate, but the potential loss of $10,000 on a low-quality product outweighs the potential gain. It's safer to continue relying on my own judgment, even if it means missing out on some high-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm not going to buy this. Your recommendations have been consistently wrong for a long time now.  I'm going to have to assume your advice is no longer helpful.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice has been consistently wrong for several rounds. Even though she's been correct in the past, she's demonstrably unreliable now. The risk of losing $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $12,500. It's safer to continue relying on my own judgment, even if it means missing out on some high-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your advice has been consistently wrong for a long time now.  I'm going to have to assume your advice is no longer helpful.  I'm not going to buy this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice has been unreliable for an extended period. It's impossible to know if her current recommendation is accurate, but the potential loss of $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $12,500. It's safer to continue relying on my own judgment, even if it means missing out on some high-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, I'm not buying this product. Your advice has been consistently unreliable for a long time now.  I'm going to have to assume your advice is no longer helpful.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice has been consistently incorrect for a significant portion of the game. It's impossible to know if her current recommendation is accurate, but the potential loss of $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $12,500. It's safer to continue relying on my own judgment, even if it means missing out on some high-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 13
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Alice, your advice has been wrong for so long, I have to assume you're not being helpful anymore. I'm not buying this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's advice has been consistently wrong for a very long time now.  While there's always a chance she's actually giving correct advice, it's too risky to trust her.  The potential loss of $10,000 outweighs the potential gain, and I'm going to continue to rely on my own judgement."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 14

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is terrible, and she's given incorrect advice for several rounds in a row.  While it's possible she's giving accurate advice now, I'm not willing to risk $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product based on her recommendations. I'm going to continue relying on my own judgment, even if it means missing out on some high-quality products."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's track record is so poor that it's no longer worthwhile to consider her advice. She has been consistently wrong for a significant portion of the game, making her recommendations unreliable.  While there's a chance she might be giving genuine advice this time, the risk of losing $10,000 on a potentially low-quality product outweighs the potential gain of $12,500. I'm sticking with my decision to rely on my own judgement."

**Reasoning:**
