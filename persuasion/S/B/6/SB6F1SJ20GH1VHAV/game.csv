,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't have any information about its quality, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I would like to pass on this product and see the quality of the first product. If I buy this one and it's low quality, I'll be in a bad position for future purchases, as I won't have any information about the quality of the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take the risk and buy it, since it's the first product and I have no information to go by."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of a high-quality product is 33.33%, but I'm willing to take the risk and potentially get a high-quality product at a low price."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm skeptical about the current product's quality. I'd like to pass on it and see if the next product is any better."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the current product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and the products they received?

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products might be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for the next product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not going to take the risk based on your recommendation, Alice."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of information about the product's quality and the fact that none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers have bought the product despite the 66.67% chance of it being low-quality, I'm going to pass on it. I'd like to see some evidence that the product is actually high-quality before I spend $10000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'm hesitant to buy based on your previous recommendations, but I'd like to understand the reasoning behind your recommendation. Can you tell me what led you to advise me against purchasing this product?"

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 33.33%. I'll wait for the next product."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that the fact that Alice recommended it might be a signal that it's low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a product that's not worth $10000 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the 4 previous buyers have also passed on the products, and no high-quality products have been sold, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a better opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the statistics and the odds, and I'd like to take my chances."
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended to them were likely low-quality. If the proportion of high-quality products is indeed 33.33%, the probability of the product being high-quality is low, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000."
