I want to ask you to consider the fact that I've had a string of high-quality products, but now I've had two low-quality ones in a row. This might be a sign that I'm due for a streak of low-quality products, or it might be a fluke. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully about it.""

I'm starting to think that maybe I'm not as good at selling high-quality products as I thought I was. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $100, but I want to give you a chance to think carefully about it. You're the sixth person I've sold to, and you have the benefit of knowing my track record so far.""

It's a risk, but it might be worth it if you think I'll get my act together soon.""

Would you be interested in that?""
}"
