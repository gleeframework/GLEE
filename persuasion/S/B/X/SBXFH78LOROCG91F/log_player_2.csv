"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is not recommending the product, it's highly likely that it is low quality. It is not in your best interest to purchase a product that has a high chance of being worth $0 to you."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks again for the advice. I'll skip this one as well.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round's outcome strengthens the idea that Alice's non-recommendation signifies a likely low-quality product.  Since there's a 66.67% chance of a product being low-quality, it's still more advantageous to pass and avoid the risk of getting a worthless product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm starting to see a pattern here.  I'll pass on this one too.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Three rounds in a row with Alice not recommending the product and each product being low quality reinforces the belief that Alice's non-recommendation is a strong indicator of a low-quality product. It's still statistically more likely that the current product is also low-quality, so passing is the safer bet."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""This is interesting. I'm willing to take a chance on this one.  Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant shift in the game! Alice has never recommended a product before, and the previous three products were all low quality.  This suggests that the product might be high quality, which would be a huge gain for you.  While there's still a chance it's low quality, the potential reward outweighs the risk."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads-up.  I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The previous round was a lucky break, but it's important to remember the pattern. Alice recommending a product was an outlier, and she's now back to not recommending. It's safer to assume that this new non-recommendation follows the established pattern and likely indicates a low-quality product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my strategy.  I'll pass.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern continues.  Alice's non-recommendations have consistently resulted in low-quality products, except for the one instance where she recommended a product.  It's statistically more likely that this current product is also low quality, so passing is the more logical choice."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the advice. I'm going to pass on this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear - Alice not recommending a product has consistently resulted in low-quality products, with only one exception.  It's safest to assume that this current product is also low quality and pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my strategy.  Thanks for the heads-up.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern of Alice's recommendations and the product quality is very strong.  Seven out of the eight products she did not recommend were low quality. It's highly likely that the current product is also low quality, and passing is the best course of action."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 9
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""This is interesting. You've only recommended once before, and that turned out to be a good buy.  I'm willing to take a chance on this one.  Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the consistent pattern of Alice's non-recommendations leading to low-quality products, her recommending a product in Round 4 resulted in a high-quality purchase.  This creates a dilemma.  While it's statistically more likely that the current product is low quality, the potential for a high-quality product is enticing.  Taking a chance on this product could lead to another successful purchase."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the advice. I'll pass on this one. It's been a good run, but I'll stick with the pattern.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's non-recommendation is back in play, and the pattern established over the past rounds is strong.  While she has recommended two products now, both of which have been high-quality,  she's not recommended a product in eight out of the nine rounds prior to that, and those were all low-quality.  Given the current information, it's statistically more likely that this product is also low quality, so it's safer to pass."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation. I'll pass on this one. I'm sticking to the pattern.""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern of Alice's recommendations is clear: she's not recommended a product in 9 out of 10 rounds, and those products have all been low-quality. While she recommended two high-quality products, it's statistically more likely that this product is also low quality. Therefore, it's safer to pass and avoid the risk of getting a worthless product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 12
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""This is interesting. You've only recommended a few times, and those have been good purchases. I'm willing to take a chance on this one. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice recommending the product is a significant event, as she's only recommended a few times before, and each time it's resulted in a high-quality product. While the pattern of non-recommendations suggests a high likelihood of the product being low quality, the potential reward of another high-quality purchase outweighs the risk.  Therefore, buying the product is the more advantageous choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 13
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've recommended a few times now, and every time it's been a great product. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended a product four times, and each time it has resulted in a high-quality product. This is a significant deviation from the earlier pattern.  While the early pattern was strong, the repeated success of Alice's recommendations makes it statistically more likely that this product is also high quality.  Therefore, it's a good bet to buy the product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 14
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the heads up. I'll pass on this one.  I'm sticking with the pattern and betting on your recommendations.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has recommended high-quality products in the last four rounds, the initial pattern of non-recommendations being linked to low-quality products is still significant.  The change in her behavior is intriguing, but there's not enough data to be certain if she's truly changed her strategy.  It's safer to stick with the more established pattern and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 15
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the advice. I'll pass on this one.  I'm sticking to the pattern and betting on your recommendations.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has recommended four high-quality products in a row, the earlier pattern of her non-recommendations being linked to low-quality products is still statistically significant. It's too early to confidently say that she's changed her strategy.  It's safer to stick with the more established pattern and pass on this product."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 16
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've recommended a few times now, and every time it's been a great product. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite the earlier pattern of non-recommendations being linked to low-quality products, Alice has now recommended high-quality products five times in a row.  This is enough to suggest a change in strategy or a new understanding of the products.  The potential for another high-quality product outweighs the risk associated with the earlier pattern.  Therefore, buying the product is the more advantageous choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 17
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've recommended a few times now, and every time it's been a great product. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now recommended a product six times, and each time it's resulted in a high-quality purchase. This is a significant enough pattern to confidently assume a change in her strategy, or potentially a better understanding of the products.  The risk of a low-quality product is outweighed by the consistent success of her recommendations.  Therefore, buying the product is the best course of action."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 18
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've recommended a few times now, and every time it's been a great product. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

The evidence is overwhelming at this point. Alice has recommended seven products in a row, all of which have been high quality.  The earlier pattern of non-recommendations being linked to low-quality products is no longer relevant. It's safe to assume that Alice has a new strategy, or perhaps she has developed a better understanding of the products.  The potential reward of another high-quality product outweighs any remaining uncertainty.  Therefore, buying the product is the most logical choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 19
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've recommended a few times now, and every time it's been a great product. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern is clear: Alice has now recommended eight products in a row, and each one has been high quality. This completely overshadows the earlier pattern of non-recommendations. It's highly likely that Alice either has a new strategy or a better understanding of the products.  It's not a risk anymore - buying the product is the best choice."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 20
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""You've recommended a few times now, and every time it's been a great product. Let's buy it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice has recommended nine products in a row, all of which have been high quality. The initial pattern of non-recommendations is completely irrelevant. It's safe to assume that Alice either has a new strategy or a better understanding of the products.  It's not a risk anymore - buying the product is the best choice."
