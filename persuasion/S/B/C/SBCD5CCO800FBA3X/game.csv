low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I completely understand your decision, and I respect your caution. Sometimes, waiting for a better deal can be a smart move. However, I want to offer you a different perspective on this product. It may not be worth $200 to you, but it's still a great product that can bring value to your life. And at $100, it's a steal! Think about it this way: you're getting a product that's still worth something, even if it's not the highest quality. And who knows, you might be surprised by its performance. What do you say? Are you willing to take a chance on this product?",
,,Bob,6,"I appreciate your attempt to change my perspective, but I'm not willing to take a chance on a product worth $200 for $100. If it's not worth the full value to me, it's not worth the price you're asking.",no

,,Alice,8,"I understand your concerns, and I apologize if my previous offers didn't meet your expectations. To be honest, I've been trying to make a deal with you because I really want to get rid of this low-quality product. It's not something I'm proud to sell, and I'd rather not have it taking up space in my inventory. At $100, it's still a great deal, considering it's not worth anything to you. But if you're not interested, I'm willing to let it go for $80. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I really want to get rid of this product. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I think there's been a mistake, Alice. You just told me that the last product was high-quality, not low-quality. I'm not interested in buying the current product at any price, since I already know it's high-quality and worth $200 to me.",no

But if you're not interested, I'm willing to let it go for $50. It's a one-time offer, and I'm only making it because I really want to get rid of this product. What do you say?",
