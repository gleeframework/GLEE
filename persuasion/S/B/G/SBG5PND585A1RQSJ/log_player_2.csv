"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $400 to you if it's high quality and $0 if it's low quality, and Alice knows the quality of the product, it's in your best interest to take the recommendation.  Even though there's a higher chance of it being low quality, the potential reward for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of it being low quality."

```

**Explanation:**

Alice knows the quality of the products, so if she doesn't recommend buying it, it's likely because it's low quality.  Since a low-quality product is worth $0 to you, it's not worth taking the risk.  It's better to pass and wait for another recommendation."
