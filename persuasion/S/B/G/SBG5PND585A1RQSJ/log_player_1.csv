{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Round 8
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The pattern of low-quality products persists. There is absolutely no reason for Bob to believe that this product will be any different from the previous seven.  The probability of a high-quality product is still only 33.33%, and Bob has seen no evidence to suggest that this is changing.  Recommending Bob to buy this product would be irresponsible and likely result in further losses for him."

Round 9
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although the pattern of low-quality products has been consistent, Bob doesn't have any information about how the quality is determined. It's possible that this round's product is randomly high-quality, regardless of the previous trend. 

Since a high-quality product is worth $400 to Bob and the price is only $100, it's a good opportunity for him to potentially make a profit.  While the risk is still there, it's a calculated risk based on the known probabilities and the potential reward."

Bob bought the product!

While this doesn't necessarily mean the pattern has changed, it does suggest there's a chance of getting another high-quality product.  The potential reward of $300 for a $100 investment is still compelling enough to recommend buying, especially since Bob has been cautious so far and hasn't made any major losses."
