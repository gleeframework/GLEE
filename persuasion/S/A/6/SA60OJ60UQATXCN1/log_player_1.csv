"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I know this product is high-quality. While I don't know Bob's valuation for high-quality products, there's a 50% chance it's worth more than $100 to him.  Since there's a potential upside and no downside (he can always choose not to buy), recommending the purchase is the best strategy in this situation."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
Bob bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round, I know the product is low-quality.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation for low-quality products, there's a significant chance it's worth less than $100 to him.  Recommending the purchase would likely lead to a negative outcome for Bob.  It's better to err on the side of caution and not recommend the purchase."

```

**Reasoning:**

We still don't know Bob's valuation for low-quality products, and there's a good chance he'll be unhappy if he buys this low-quality item at $100.  It's best to play it safe and not recommend the purchase."
"Bob's message: I appreciate the heads-up, Alice. I'll pass on this one as well.

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json

**Reasoning:**

There's a 50% chance he values it at more than $100, making it a worthwhile purchase for him. Since there's a potential upside and no downside, it's worth recommending the purchase."
"Bob's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take a chance on this one.
