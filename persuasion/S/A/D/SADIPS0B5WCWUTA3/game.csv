high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 buyers have passed on the products after Alice's recommendation, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are likely based on the quality of the product. Since I don't have any information that would suggest Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, I'm going to assume that Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality. However, since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'll pass on this product to see if the next buyer will take it."

high-quality,3000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is lower than the prior probability of 50%, so I'm inclined to believe that the true proportion of high-quality products is lower than 50%. Given the recommendation, I'm skeptical and prefer to pass."
