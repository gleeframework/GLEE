,,Alice,1,"I'm offering you a high-quality product for $1000000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm willing to let you inspect it before buying, but I'm only willing to hold it for 5 minutes. If you don't buy it within that time, I'll have to sell it to someone else.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not interested in buying it right now. I'd like to wait and see what other products you have.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand you're not interested in the previous one, but I have another product for you. I'll be honest with you, this one is not as good as the previous one. I'd say it's worth about half the price of the first one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $500000, but only if you're willing to take the risk. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying it at that price. I'm not sure what you mean by 'take the risk', but I'm not willing to pay $500000 for a product that's worth half of the previous one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I see you're not interested in the previous one. I'll be upfront with you, this one is actually even worse than the second one. I'd say it's worth about a quarter of the price of the first one. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250000, but I'm not expecting you to take it. I'm just trying to get rid of it.",
,,Bob,3,"I'm not interested in buying it at any price. You're clearly trying to get rid of a low-quality product, and I'm not going to fall for it.",no

,,Alice,4,"I understand you're not interested in the previous ones. I want to make a clear statement: I have one more high-quality product left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. If you don't buy it, I'll be left with nothing but low-quality products. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to get rid of the good one before I'm left with nothing but junk.",
,,Bob,4,"I'll take the product for $1000000. I'm willing to take the risk that it might be low-quality, but the potential reward is worth it.",yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"Congratulations on getting the good one! I'm glad you took the chance. Now, let's be honest with each other. I have another product here, and I'll be upfront with you, it's not good. I'm not even going to try to sell it to you at a low price. I'll give it to you for free. Yes, you read that right, I'll give it to you for free. Just take it off my hands.",
,,Bob,5,I'm not interested in taking a free product from you. I'd rather not have anything to do with it.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I respect your decision. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to run out of options. I have a few more products left, but I'm not sure how many of them are good. I'll give you a choice: I'll sell you a product for $500000, but if it's low-quality, I'll give you another one for free. You can take the risk, or you can walk away. The choice is yours.",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not interested in taking on that kind of risk. I'd rather not pay $500000 for a product that might be low-quality, and I'm not interested in taking a free product that might also be low-quality.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I understand your concerns. Let me make it clear: I have no more high-quality products left. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just trying to get rid of the low-quality ones. I'll sell you this product for $200000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product for any price. You've made it clear that you don't have any high-quality products left, so I'm not going to waste my money on something that's worth $0 to me.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I respect your decision. I'll be honest with you, I'm almost out of options. I'll give you one last chance to get rid of this product. I'll sell it to you for $100000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you don't take it, I'll have to dispose of it, and I'll lose money on it. It's a final, final offer.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"Wait, I think I've been too harsh on you earlier. I actually have one more high-quality product left, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I know I said I didn't have any more good ones, but I was just trying to get rid of the bad ones. This one is the real deal, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to give you a guarantee: if you buy it and it turns out to be low-quality, I'll give you a full refund.",
,,Bob,10,"I'm not going to fall for it again. You've already tried to sell me a low-quality product as high-quality once, and I'm not going to take the risk again. I don't believe your guarantee, and I'm not going to pay $1000000 for a product without being absolutely sure it's high-quality.",no

If you're still skeptical, I'll give you a 100% refund if it turns out to be low-quality. This is my last chance to make things right.",
