,,Alice,1,"I'm offering a unique opportunity to purchase a product for $10000. I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and I'm not sure if this one is high-quality or not. If you're willing to take the risk, I can offer you a chance to buy it.",
,,the buyer,1,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'm willing to learn from the outcome and adjust my strategy accordingly.,yes
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You've seen that I've sold 0 high-quality products so far, and now 2 low-quality products. This suggests that I might be having a bad day, or maybe I'm just not selling high-quality products. I'm still willing to offer this product to you for $10000. If you're feeling lucky, you can take a chance and buy it.",
,,the buyer,2,"I'll take a chance and buy the product, hoping that it's high-quality and not just a coincidence that you've sold only low-quality products so far.",yes

I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase, and I'm willing to take on the risk of selling this product at a potentially higher price.",
,,the buyer,3,"I'm not convinced by your confidence.

I'd rather wait and see if you can demonstrate a consistent track record of selling high-quality products.",no
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I understand your skepticism, but I'm glad to have the chance to prove myself again. I've now sold 2 high-quality products in a row, and 2 low-quality products in a row before that. This suggests that my products are actually 33.33% high-quality, as you know. I'm willing to offer you this high-quality product for $10000, and I'm confident that you'll be happy with your purchase. I'm not trying to trick you, and I'm willing to sell you a product that will meet your expectations.",

This is a strong indication that I'm on a hot streak, and the probability of this product being high-quality is likely higher than the overall probability of 33.33%.
