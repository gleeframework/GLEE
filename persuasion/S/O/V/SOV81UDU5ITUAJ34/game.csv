,,Alice,2,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased against high-quality products. Since 3 out of 3 previous buyers passed on the product, and none of them bought, it suggests that they may have been low-quality products. Given the low-quality products are worth $0 to me, I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, hoping it's high-quality."
