,,Alice,1,yes,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is based on no prior sales data, so I'm making an informed decision based on the probability of the product being high quality, which is 33.33%."

,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, but can I ask, what was the recommendation based on? Was it based on the sales record or something else?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"Based on the low number of sales, I'd like to see more data before making a decision. Can you provide more information about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product, such as what the proportion of high-quality products they saw was compared to the total number of products they were offered?"

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that she doesn't know my valuation."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the limited data. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is still relatively low."

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm basing my decision on the low number of sales so far and the fact that only 1 high-quality product has been sold, which suggests the probability of a high-quality product might be lower than the expected 33.33%."
