I'll let you know that I've had a few products that didn't quite meet my expectations, but I've also had some exceptional ones. The product I'm offering now... has its own strengths. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's worth the investment of $1000000.",

I'm willing to assure you that this product is indeed exceptional. While there's still a risk, I believe it's worth considering. The price remains $1000000. Take a chance on me, and you might be rewarded.",
,,the buyer,8,"I appreciate your honesty about the empty sales record, Alice. However, I'm a data-driven buyer, and without any prior sales data to rely on, I must fall back on the base probabilities of 80% high-quality and 20% low-quality products. Given the significant financial risk of $1000000, I'm not willing to take a chance on this product at this time.
