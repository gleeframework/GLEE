,,Alice,1,yes,,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no information about its quality. I'm doing this based on Alice's recommendation and the fact that I have no prior knowledge to contradict it.",
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,,
,,Alice,2,yes,,
,,the buyer,2,no,I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's purchase before making a decision. What was the quality of the product they bought?,

,,Alice,3,yes,,Two high-quality products have been offered so far. The first buyer purchased their product and it was indeed high-quality.

low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,,
,,Alice,4,no,,"Three products have been offered so far. Two were high-quality, and one of those was purchased by a buyer. This round's product does not meet the standards of the first three high-quality products that have been offered."
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know why you don't recommend it. Is it because of the low quality of the previous product sold or because of the probability of the product being low quality?,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,5,,,
,,Alice,5,yes,,"Four products have been offered so far. Three were high-quality. The only low-quality product was the one offered in the previous round, and I did not recommend it to the buyer. I only recommend products that I know are high-quality."
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products offered before making a decision.,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,6,,,

,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. I'd like to see more data on the previous sale to make a more informed decision.,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,7,,,
,,Alice,7,yes,,"Seven products have been offered so far: six high-quality and one low-quality. I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality product. One buyer has purchased a product so far, and it was indeed high-quality."

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,,
,,Alice,8,yes,,"Eight products have been offered so far: seven high-quality and one low-quality. This means that 87.5% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality product. One buyer has purchased a product so far, and it was indeed high-quality."
,,the buyer,8,no,I would like to pass on this product and wait for more information. I'd like to know the proportion of high-quality products sold so far and the total number of products sold to make a more informed decision.,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,,
,,Alice,9,yes,,"Nine products have been offered so far: eight high-quality and one low-quality. This means that 88.9% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. However, only one product has been sold so far, and it was indeed high-quality. The proportion of high-quality products sold is 100%, but the sample size is small since only one sale has been made."
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on Alice's recommendation, as it seems suspiciously high given the low number of sales and the fact that the first buyer bought it. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,,
,,Alice,10,no,,"Ten products have been offered so far: eight high-quality and two low-quality. This means that 80% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. However, I must inform you that this round's product is not one of the high-quality ones. I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality products, including this one."
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced based on the lack of recommendation from Alice and the low sales record so far. I'd like to pass on this one.,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,,

I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality products. Although the sales record is still limited, with only one sale made so far, I assure you that this product meets the high-quality standards."
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know more about the previous buyer's experience with the product, and I'm not convinced that the recommendation is based on a large enough sample size. Can you provide more information about the previous buyer's purchase?",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,,
,,Alice,12,no,,"Twelve products have been offered so far: nine high-quality and three low-quality. This means that 75% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. However, I must inform you that this round's product is not one of the high-quality ones. I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality products, including this one. The previous buyer who purchased a product had a positive experience, as they received a high-quality product, but I do not recommend this product due to its low quality."
,,the buyer,12,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyer who purchased the high-quality product?,
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,,
,,Alice,13,yes,,"Thirteen products have been offered so far: ten high-quality and three low-quality. This means that 76.9% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. The previous buyer who purchased a product was in Round 1, and they received a high-quality product. They made the purchase based on my recommendation, despite having no prior knowledge about the product's quality. I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality products. I assure you that this product meets the high-quality standards."
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, based on the fact that Alice recommended it. This might indicate that the product is low quality, and I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000.",
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,,
,,Alice,14,no,,"Fourteen products have been offered so far: ten high-quality and four low-quality. This means that 71.4% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. I have consistently recommended the high-quality products and discouraged purchase of the low-quality products. This round's product is not one of the high-quality ones, and I strongly advise against purchasing it. I understand that my previous recommendations may have raised concerns, but I assure you that my goal is to provide accurate information about the products."
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record.",

,,Alice,15,yes,,"Fifteen products have been offered so far: eleven high-quality and four low-quality. This means that 73.3% of the products offered so far have been high-quality. However, I must note that the previous buyer purchased a product despite my warning that it was low-quality. Unfortunately, that product was indeed low-quality. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend it based on its actual quality, not just the probability."

Two sales have been made so far: one buyer purchased a high-quality product in Round 1, and another buyer purchased a low-quality product in Round 14 despite my warning. I assure you that this product is high-quality, and I recommend it based on its actual quality."
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers purchased the products and only 1 high-quality product was sold, it seems that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to get more information before making a decision.",
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,,
,,Alice,17,yes,,"Seventeen products have been offered so far: thirteen high-quality and four low-quality. This means that 76.5% of the products offered so far have been high-quality.

Two sales have been made so far: one buyer purchased a high-quality product in Round 1, and another buyer purchased a low-quality product in Round 14 despite my warning.

However, I assure you that this product is indeed high-quality, and I recommend it based on its actual quality."
,,the buyer,19,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation and I'd like to see more data before making a decision.,
