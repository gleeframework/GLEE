Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I'm glad you're interested in purchasing a product. I've sold 1 high-quality product so far, and I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. I want to assure you that the probability of this product being high-quality is 80%, just like the last one. However, I'd like to highlight that the law of large numbers suggests that as I sell more products, the proportion of high-quality products should converge to the expected value. Since I've already sold 1 high-quality product, it's likely that the next product will also be high-quality. Would you like to take the chance and buy this product?

Would you like to buy the current product?","{

However, I'm a risk-taker and would like to take the chance to buy the product.

Alice's message: Welcome to my store! I've sold 2 products so far, with 1 of them being high-quality. I'd like to provide some context: since the probability of a product being high-quality is 80%, it's expected that 80% of my sales will be high-quality products. However, I've only sold 1 high-quality product so far, which is below the expected value. This could be due to chance, or it could be that I've been selling a streak of low-quality products. I'm offering this new product to you for $1000000. Considering the discrepancy between my sales and the expected value, I'd like to ask: are you willing to take the risk and buy this product, or would you like to wait and see how my sales unfold?
