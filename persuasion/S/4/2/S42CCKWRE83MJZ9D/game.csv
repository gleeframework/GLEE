low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it, and I think there's a good chance it's a low-quality product. I'm hoping to get a low-quality product and save $10000!"
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think it's unlikely to be high quality given the previous sales record."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"Based on the fact that 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers were misled by your recommendations and didn't get high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me why you're not recommending it?
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the current statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 purchases, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better offer."

,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and there have been no high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm going to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a risk-taker and I think the potential reward of a high-quality product is worth the risk of getting a low-quality one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that I know the odds are 50/50 and Alice's recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather her strategy to manipulate the sales."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,

high-quality,12500.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, it suggests that the products they were recommended to buy were likely low-quality. This increases the likelihood that the current product is also low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that all previous buyers have received low-quality products, which is an unusually low proportion of high-quality products sold. I'd like to see a more balanced distribution of high-quality products before making a purchase."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 purchases, it suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,17,yes,
