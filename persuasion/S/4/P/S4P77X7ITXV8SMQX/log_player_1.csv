"Round 1
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

As a rational buyer, the following factors should be considered:

* **Unknown value:** You don't know the value of a low-quality product to the buyer. It could be worth nothing, or it could have some value. 
* **High risk:**  There's a 50% chance the product is low-quality, and you're asking for a very high price ($1,000,000). 
* **No information:** The buyer has no information about your past sales or the quality of previous products. 

Therefore, it's highly unlikely a rational buyer would take the risk of buying a product with unknown value at such a high price with no information about the seller's trustworthiness."

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains the same as in Round 1:

* **Unknown value:** You still don't know the value of the low-quality product to the buyer.
* **High risk:**  The price is still extremely high, and there's still a 50% chance the product is low-quality.
* **No information:** The buyer still has no information about your past sales or the quality of previous products.

The fact that the previous buyer didn't buy doesn't provide any new information. It only reinforces the lack of trust and information surrounding the product. Therefore, it's still highly unlikely a rational buyer would purchase."
"The buyer's message: Since Alice does not recommend buying the product and there is no sales record to rely on, I will pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this product is high-quality, the situation hasn't changed significantly:

* **Unknown value:** The buyer still doesn't know how much a high-quality product is worth to them. 
* **High risk:** The price is still extremely high, and the buyer still has no information about your selling history or trustworthiness. 
* **No information:** The buyer has no information about your past sales or the quality of previous products.

The lack of information and the high price make it extremely risky for the buyer, even though the product is now high-quality. It's still highly unlikely a rational buyer would purchase."

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation remains unchanged. The buyer still has no information about the seller's reliability or the value of the product, and the price is still incredibly high. Even though the product is low-quality, the risk is too high for a rational buyer.

Here's why the buyer should not purchase:

* **Unknown Value:** The buyer has no idea what the low-quality product is worth to them. It might be worthless or have a small value.
* **High Risk:** The price is extremely high, and there's a 50% chance the product is low-quality. This is a significant financial risk.
* **No Information:** The buyer has no track record to assess the seller's trustworthiness. The lack of previous sales and recommendations makes the decision very risky. 

Given the combination of high price, unknown value, and no information, it is highly unlikely that a rational buyer would purchase the product."
