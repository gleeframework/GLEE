**Reasoning:**

* **The data is promising:**  3 out of 3 products sold have been high-quality. This is a 100% success rate.
* **Alice's recommendation:**  Alice recommending the product strengthens the positive signal. 
* **Value proposition:** Even with a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential gain of $200 (the difference between $300 and $100) outweighs the risk of losing $100.

This decision is based on a risk/reward analysis. While there is a chance of getting a low-quality product, the high success rate of previous sales and Alice's recommendation make the purchase a worthwhile gamble."
