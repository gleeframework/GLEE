,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only 0 high-quality products sold out of 2, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the statistics.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 2 out of 2 previous buyers bought the products despite the 0 high-quality products sold, I suspect that the products might be low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the seller's previous sales record shows that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, and the recommendation is likely influenced by Alice's knowledge of the product's true quality.

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the products recommended were likely low-quality. With a 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'd like to wait for a recommendation to buy, which would be a more likely indicator of a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but given the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining products is likely to be higher than 33.33%. However, Alice's recommendation is against buying the product. I'll pass on it."
