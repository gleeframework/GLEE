,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't buy it, which makes me think it might be low quality. I'd like to see the outcome of the previous buyer's product before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not buying. Based on the statistics, 1 out of 1 product sold was low quality, so I'm going to pass on this one."

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'm not convinced by the lack of sales so far, and Alice's recommendation doesn't help. I'd like to pass on this one."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product's quality?
high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on the recommendation. I'm not sure if the recommendation is based on the product's quality or the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, and Alice recommended it to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that the first buyer also passed on the product, and there have been no high-quality products sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the lack of evidence of high-quality products being sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm the second buyer and I'm not sure if there's any pattern to your recommendations yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk, and I'd like to know the outcome."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it despite your recommendation, not because of it. I'm taking a chance because I think the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this product. I'd like to know if it's high or low quality, so I can make a more informed decision for future purchases."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,I'm not buying based on your previous recommendations and the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this product. It's likely that the previous buyers were recommended low-quality products, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 50%. I'd rather wait for a product that is more likely to be high-quality."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 4 out of 4 products were low-quality, I'm going to assume the probability of a high-quality product is lower than 50% and decide to pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased high-quality products.
