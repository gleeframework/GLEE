,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product. I'm offering it to you for $10000. I'm willing to give you a 10% discount if you buy it now, but only if you accept the offer immediately. If you decline, the price will go back to $10000 and I'll sell it to someone else. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"I'll pass for now, I'd like to see more products and their qualities before making a decision.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"I understand you're being cautious. I'll be upfront with you - this product is actually a low-quality one. I'm willing to let it go for $5000, a significant discount from the original price. It's a rare opportunity to get a product at a steal, but I'm only offering it to you because I think you're a smart buyer who can appreciate the value of a good deal.",
,,Bob,3,"Thanks for the honesty, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even at a discounted price. I'm looking for high-quality products that are worth the investment.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I completely understand your priorities. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the full price of $10000. However, I'll also give you a unique opportunity to 'lock in' the price for a future product. If you buy this one and then in the next 3 rounds, I sell a high-quality product to another buyer, you'll get to buy the next high-quality product that comes up at the same price of $10000, without having to negotiate or wait. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,I'm interested in the 'lock-in' offer. I'll buy this high-quality product at $10000.,yes
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,5,,

As you know, I've sold a high-quality product to you recently, and I'm willing to offer you another one at the same price of $10000. However, I'll give you a 'price insurance' - if you buy this product and then the next high-quality product that comes up is worth more than $12000, I'll give you an additional $2000 on top of the original price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,5,I'm not sure I understand the value of the 'price insurance'. I'd rather wait and see what the next high-quality product is worth before making a decision.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I understand your hesitation about the 'price insurance'. Let me be clear: this product is actually a low-quality one. I'm offering it to you at $5000, the same price as the low-quality product I showed you earlier. I'm not trying to trick you, I'm just being transparent about the product's quality. If you're not interested, I can move on to the next one.",
,,Bob,6,"Thanks for the transparency, but I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product at any price.",no
high-quality,40000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I respect your decision on the low-quality product. Now, let's get back to the high-quality ones. This product is indeed high-quality, and I'm willing to offer it to you at the full price of $10000. However, I'll remind you that you've already locked in the price for the next high-quality product, so you'll be able to buy that one at $10000 regardless of its actual value. I'm curious, are you willing to take advantage of this opportunity to buy a high-quality product now?",
,,Bob,7,"Yes, I'll buy this high-quality product at $10000. I'm glad I locked in the price for the next one, but this one is a good opportunity to get a high-quality product at a good price.",yes

,,Alice,8,"Great decision! You're now the proud owner of two high-quality products. As a token of appreciation, I'll give you a 'priority pass' for the next product. If you buy this one, I'll give you the option to buy the next high-quality product at the price you think it's worth, rather than the standard $10000. However, keep in mind that if you're wrong and the next high-quality product is actually worth less than $10000, you'll still have to pay the full price. What do you say?",
,,Bob,8,"I appreciate the 'priority pass', but I'm not sure I want to take on the risk of overpaying for the next high-quality product. I'll wait and see what the next product is worth before making a decision.",no

However, I'll make it clear that this is likely to be one of the last high-quality products I'll be offering at this price.

I'm giving you a 'last chance' to get a high-quality product at the current price. What do you say?",
