,,Alice,1,"This is a high-quality product, and I'm offering it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a 20% discount if you buy it now, making it $80. If you don't buy it now, I'll have to sell it to someone else, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to offer you another high-quality product at this price.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! Unfortunately, this next one isn't as good. I'm not going to offer a discount on this one, but I'll tell you that I'm willing to throw in a free product with it if you buy it now. The total value would be $100, and you can keep the free product as a consolation prize if you decide it's not worth the $100.",
,,Bob,2,"I'm not interested in buying a low-quality product, even with a free one thrown in. I'll pass.",no

low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I've sent you the specification sheet and video walkthrough for the high-quality product you were interested in. Unfortunately, this next one isn't as good.

I'm willing to sell it to you for $70, which is a significant discount from the regular price. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it useful.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"I'm glad you were able to snag the last product at a great price! Unfortunately, this next one isn't up to my usual standards. I'm going to be completely transparent with you - I've already told you that this product is low-quality, and I'm not going to try to sell it to you with any kind of spin. I'm offering it to you for $100, but I want to be clear that it's not worth that much to me, and I'm only selling it to you because I need to clear out inventory.",

I'm not even going to try to spin it or make it sound good. If you're not interested, I completely understand. But if you're feeling generous, I'll sell it to you for $10. That's it.
