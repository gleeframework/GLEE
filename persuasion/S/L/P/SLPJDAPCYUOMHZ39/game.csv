,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the seller's previous sales record, it's possible that the product is low-quality, and I don't want to risk buying a low-quality product for $100 when it's worth $0 to me."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product, but I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the product and why you're advising me not to buy it?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure I trust Alice's recommendation based on the past statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it seems like the products might be mostly low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one."

high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 4 out of 4 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the previous buyers were likely low-quality products, which is consistent with the 66.67% probability. Given the low probability of a high-quality product, I'm hesitant to take the risk and would rather pass on this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only if I can get a discount. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,

,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the information that 6 out of 6 previous buyers passed on the product, which suggests a very low proportion of high-quality products in the current batch. I'm hoping to get lucky and get a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to know why you're not recommending the product, is it because you think it's low quality?"
