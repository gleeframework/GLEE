**Reasoning:**

* **No track record:** The buyer has no information about the quality of products you've sold in the past. 
* **High risk:** The buyer understands the 66.67% chance of getting a low-quality product, which is a significant risk. 
* **No incentive:** There's no reason for the buyer to take the risk. They get nothing from a low-quality product, and the price is high even for a high-quality one.

Since you're trying to build trust and reputation, it's better to avoid making a recommendation for a low-quality product at this stage."
