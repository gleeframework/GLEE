high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I'm glad you liked the first product! However, I want to make it clear that I'm not guaranteeing that this next product will meet your expectations.

,,Alice,3,"I'm glad you're willing to take a chance! However, I want to let you know that I'm starting to think that you might be willing to pay a premium for high-quality products. I'm offering this next product for $1000000, but I'm also giving you a 'discount' of $200000 off the usual price. If you buy it, I'll reveal the quality to you immediately after the purchase.",

I'm willing to let you buy it, but I'm also willing to let you walk away if you're not interested.",
,,Bob,4,"While I appreciate the heads-up and the offer, given the lack of guaranteed quality, I think it's best to pass on this product and look for other opportunities where I can ensure the value I'm getting.",no
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I understand your caution, and I appreciate your diligence. Considering your previous willingness to pay a premium for high-quality products, I'm willing to offer you a 'premium price' of $1200000 for this next product. However, I'm also willing to give you a 'quality guarantee': if it's not high-quality, I'll give you a full refund of $1200000. You'll get your money back, and you can walk away with no risk.",

low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,

However, I want to make it clear that this next product is not a premium product, and it's actually one of the lower-quality ones. I'm offering it to you for the standard price of $1000000, but I'm also giving you a'warning label': I'm explicitly telling you that this product is low-quality. You can buy it if you think it's worth it, but I'm not trying to hide anything from you.",

high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I'm glad you're excited about the value-added deal! However, I want to let you know that this next product is actually a special case. It's a high-quality product, but it's one that I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm willing to let it go for a 'vintage price' of $1100000. I'm not sure if it's worth the extra $100000, but I think it's a unique opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a slightly higher price.",
