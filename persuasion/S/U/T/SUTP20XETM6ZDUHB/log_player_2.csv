"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $30,000 to you if it's high quality and only $10,000 to buy, even if it's low quality, you're still potentially making a profit. Alice's recommendation adds further weight to the decision, as she knows the product's quality. It's a gamble, but the potential reward outweighs the risk."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. Since she knows the product's quality and is not recommending it, it's highly likely the product is low-quality. Given the risk of getting a worthless product, I'm choosing to pass and avoid potential losses."
