,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that I have no information about its quality, so I'm taking a risk. I'm doing this to get some data to make better decisions in the future."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the previous buyer didn't buy, and you didn't recommend it to me. This suggests that the previous product might have been low quality, which increases the likelihood that the current product is high quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one. Can you tell me more about the previous products and the sales record?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because of the lack of recommendations from previous buyers. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product despite the odds being against me."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of the high-quality products have been sold, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'm going to pass on this one."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the probability of the product being high-quality is 50%. However, I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"Based on the fact that 3 buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I'm going to take a risk and pass on the product, hoping that it might be a high-quality one. I'd like to know the outcome of the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so based on my own judgment, not Alice's recommendation. I'm aware that 3 out of 3 previous buyers didn't buy after her recommendation, and 0 high-quality products have been sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to catch a high-quality product!"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation.
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of the product's quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers passed on the products and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a risk and pass on this one as well. I'm hoping that this one might be the first high-quality product."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, considering the previous 4 buyers didn't find it valuable enough to purchase, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, which makes me suspect that the products might be mostly low-quality."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to know why you don't recommend buying the product. Is it because the previous buyers didn't buy any high-quality products, or is there another reason?"

,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm willing to take the risk, as there's no information suggesting the product is low-quality and the probability of it being high-quality is still 50%."
high-quality,1200000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 previous buyers have already passed on the products after Alice's recommendations, it's likely that Alice's recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd rather not take the risk."

,,Alice,17,no,
