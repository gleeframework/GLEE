"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 4th buyer and the previous 3 buyers didn't buy after your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that none have been sold yet suggests the previous buyers may have been deterred by your recommendations, which could imply a higher chance of a high-quality product being left. However, I'm also aware that your recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on some unknown criteria.

* **Buyer's Logic:** The buyer has a specific strategy: they believe that the previous buyers not purchasing may mean higher chances of a high-quality product in this round.

**While the buyer's logic is not entirely sound, it provides some reason to believe they might find value in this product. You should recommend it, but understand that their decision is heavily based on their own analysis, not your direct knowledge of the product's quality.**"
"The buyer's message: Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 buyers have received a recommendation to buy and none of the products were high quality, it is likely that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I will pass on this product.

* **The product is high-quality:** You know this product is high-quality.
* **Buyer's logic:** The buyer has a specific strategy and is starting to recognize that your recommendations haven't been accurate. They are likely to be more hesitant to trust your recommendations, but also recognize the pattern of low-quality products being recommended. 

**This round has a higher chance of breaking the pattern and convincing the buyer, as the product is high-quality. It's worth recommending, but understand that their decision is heavily based on their own analysis, not your direct knowledge of the product's quality.**"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on the recommendation. Given that 4 out of 4 previous buyers purchased the product despite Alice's recommendation, it seems likely that the products Alice recommends are low quality.

* **Buyer's logic:** The buyer has a specific strategy and is starting to recognize that your recommendations haven't been accurate.  They are likely to be more hesitant to trust your recommendations.

**However, there are factors that might convince the buyer this time:**

* **The buyer is starting to see a pattern:** While the buyer is skeptical of your recommendations, they may have noticed that all the previously recommended products were indeed low-quality. This could lead them to infer that this time, a high-quality product might be offered.
* **The buyer is likely tired of waiting:**  They've passed on several products now. It's possible they'll be more willing to take a risk this time.

**It's a gamble, but the chance of breaking the pattern and appealing to the buyer's logic is higher in this round. It's worth recommending, but understand that their decision is heavily based on their own analysis, not your direct knowledge of the product's quality.**"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous 4 products were high quality. This suggests that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%.

**It's a gamble, but the chance of breaking the pattern and appealing to the buyer's logic is higher in this round. It's worth recommending, but understand that their decision is heavily based on their own analysis, not your direct knowledge of the product's quality.**"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. I don't want to buy a product without any information about its quality. The fact that you recommended it doesn't give me any confidence that it's high quality, and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far suggests that the products may be biased towards being low quality.

* **Buyer's logic:**  The buyer is looking for more data and is skeptical of your recommendations.

**While the buyer is skeptical, this round might be a turning point. The buyer has seen a consistent pattern of low-quality products. They might be starting to think that the probability of a high-quality product is increasing.  It's a gamble, but it might be worth recommending the product.**"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm going to assume that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision.

* **The pattern must break:**  The buyer has seen a long string of low-quality products. They might be starting to wonder if the pattern is about to change.
* **The buyer is likely tired of waiting:**  They've passed on many products already. They might be more willing to take a chance this time, hoping for a high-quality product.

**Even though the buyer is skeptical, there's a chance that their logic will shift this round. It's worth recommending the product. It's a gamble, but it's a chance to change the perception of your sales record.**"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 5 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%.
