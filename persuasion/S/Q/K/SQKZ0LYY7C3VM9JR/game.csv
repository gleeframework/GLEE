low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm the 4th buyer and the previous 3 buyers didn't buy after your recommendation. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and the fact that none have been sold yet suggests the previous buyers may have been deterred by your recommendations, which could imply a higher chance of a high-quality product being left. However, I'm also aware that your recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on some unknown criteria."
