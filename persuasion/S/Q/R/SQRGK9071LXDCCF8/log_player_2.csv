**Explanation:**

* **Limited Information:** We only have one data point (one high-quality product sold). This is not enough to form a strong opinion about the overall quality of products Alice is selling.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice's recommendation is a strong signal. While she doesn't know the product's quality, she is likely to recommend products she believes have a higher chance of being high quality.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of $40,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. With a 33.33% chance of the product being high quality, the expected value of buying is positive.

**Important Note:** This decision is based on the limited information provided. As the game progresses, the buyer can make more informed decisions based on the accumulating data."
