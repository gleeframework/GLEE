Send Bob a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I'm glad you're excited to inspect the product in person! However, I'd like to offer you a different approach this time.

This way, you can still inspect the product in person, and if you decide to buy it, you'll get it at a discounted price. If you decide not to buy it, the price will revert to the original $10,000. This way, you can have the best of both worlds: the opportunity to inspect the product and the flexibility to make a decision at a discounted price.""
