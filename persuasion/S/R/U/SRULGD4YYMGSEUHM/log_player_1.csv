"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

You should recommend the buyer to buy the product. Here's why:

* **High Value:** The product is high-quality, meaning it's worth $3,000,000 to the buyer.
* **Low Risk:** While the buyer doesn't know the quality yet, they know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%. This means there's a high chance they'll get a product worth significantly more than the asking price.
* **No Loss:** Even if the product turns out to be low-quality, the buyer loses only the $1,000,000 they paid. This is a relatively small loss compared to the potential gain of $2,000,000 if the product is high-quality.

In this round, the potential for a significant profit outweighs the risk of loss."

* **No Loss:** Even if the product is low-quality, the buyer loses only $1,000,000.

The buyer has no information about the previous product. They only know your track record, which is positive since you sold a high-quality product in the previous round."
