Send the potential buyer a message to help them decide whether to buy the product.","{
  ""message"": ""I've sold 9 high-quality products out of 10 total products, and then two low-quality products in a row.

I want to be upfront with you - the streak has ended, but that doesn't mean I don't have any high-quality products left. I'm offering you a product for $100. Would you like to take the chance?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to take the chance, but I'll make an informed decision based on the statistics. With 5 high-quality products out of 10, the probability of the next product being high-quality is still 33.33%. However, considering the streak has ended, I'll take a more cautious approach and assume the probability is lower. I'll decide based on the expected value of the product. If it's high-quality, I'll get $120, and if it's low-quality, I'll get $0. The expected value is ($120 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $40. Since $40 is greater than $0, I'll take the chance and buy the product.

However, I want to acknowledge that the last buyer made a calculated decision based on expected value, and it's a valid approach. I'm offering you a product for $100. Would you like to take the chance and make a similar calculation, or do you have a different strategy in mind?""
}"
"The buyer's message: I'll take the chance and make a similar calculation. Based on the statistics you provided, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. Since a high-quality product is worth $120 to me, I'll calculate the expected value. The expected value is 33.33% * $120 + 66.67% * $0 = $40. Since $40 is less than $100, I'll take the chance and buy the product.
