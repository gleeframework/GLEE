Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll take it!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice knows the value of each product and is recommending you buy it, it's likely the product is high quality. While there's still a 50% chance it's low quality, the potential reward of $10,000 outweighs the risk of losing $10,000. It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
