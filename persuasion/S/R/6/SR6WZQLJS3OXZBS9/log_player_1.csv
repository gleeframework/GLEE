Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Expected Value:**  The expected value of buying the product is (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000. This is equal to the price of the product.
* **Risk-Neutral:** Bob is risk-neutral since the expected value matches the price.

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Previous Information:** Bob knows the product is worth $20,000 if high-quality and $0 if low-quality.  He also knows that the probability of a high-quality product is 50%. 
* **No New Information:** The fact that Bob bought the previous product doesn't change these probabilities or the product's potential value.
* **Expected Value:** The expected value remains the same: (0.5 * $20,000) + (0.5 * $0) = $10,000, which is equal to the price.

Since the expected value is still equal to the price and this round's product is high-quality, it's still a good deal for Bob."
