,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that the first buyer didn't buy, which could indicate that the product is low quality. I'd like to wait for the next product."

,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is still 50% and I'm willing to take that risk."

,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation is based on the quality of the previous products, which were all low-quality. I'd like to wait for a new product to be offered."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the 0/2 ratio of high-quality to total products sold, and I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 purchases, which suggests a possible bias towards low-quality products. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and I think it's possible that the products are all low-quality or the seller is just unlucky so far."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 4 previous buyers, I am inclined to believe that the product is likely to be of low quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have passed on the product after your recommendation, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%.

,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that all previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them bought high-quality products, I suspect that the products recommended so far were low-quality. I don't want to fall into the same trap."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality based on the statistics, but since you don't recommend it, I'll pass on it. If I buy it and it's low quality, I'll lose $1000000. If I pass and it's high quality, I'll miss out on a $1000000 profit. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,16,yes,
