high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that the first buyer was recommended to buy and still didn't, and no high-quality products have been sold yet, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected.

,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I'm not sure if your recommendation is based on the product's quality or the lack of sales so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers purchased the products after Alice's recommendations. This suggests that Alice's recommendations might be biased towards low-quality products, so I'll take a risk and pass on this one."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"Based on the fact that none of the previous buyers were able to identify a high-quality product, I believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer can make a better decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given that 2 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the products being recommended might be low-quality."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, I'd like to pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 2 purchases, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%. This is a strong indication that the products are mostly low-quality. I'd rather not take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations. Since no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the probability of the product being high quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice has not recommended any high-quality products to the previous two buyers, which suggests that the products recommended by Alice are likely to be low-quality.
