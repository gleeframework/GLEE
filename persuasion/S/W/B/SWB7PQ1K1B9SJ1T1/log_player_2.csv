**Explanation:**

The statistics show that 8 buyers purchased the product and all 8 were high quality.  This is a very strong indicator that Alice is accurately identifying high-quality products. 

Since the potential value of a high-quality product ($30,000) significantly outweighs the cost ($10,000), and the probability of getting a high-quality product is now very high, it's a good decision to buy."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 9 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 9 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 10th buyer!
