Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Bob is now risk-averse:** After experiencing a loss in the previous round, Bob is likely hesitant to trust the seller's recommendations.  
* **No incentive to change:**  Even though Alice knows the product is high-quality,  there's no benefit for her to recommend it.  Bob already demonstrated he might buy even without a recommendation. 

By not recommending the product, Alice might even make Bob more likely to buy in future rounds, thinking she's being deliberately misleading. This is a classic signaling game!"
"Bob's message: I'm not going to fall for that again. Alice's recommendations are clearly not reliable. I'll pass on this one.
Bob didn't bought the product.

```

* **No Trust:** Bob has explicitly stated that he doesn't trust Alice's recommendations. 
* **No Gain:**  Even if Alice were to recommend the product, it's unlikely to sway Bob.  
* **Potential Harm:**  Recommending the product could reinforce Bob's distrust, making him even less likely to buy in future rounds.  

Alice should continue to withhold recommendations, hoping Bob's skepticism will eventually lead him to take a chance again."

* **Bob is unpredictable:** Bob's decision-making is now a mix of risk-aversion and a desire to potentially get lucky.  There's no reliable pattern for Alice to exploit. 
* **No clear benefit:** Recommending the product might not influence Bob, and could potentially make him more cautious in the future. 
* **Maintaining ambiguity:**  Alice is better off keeping her silence,  making Bob's decisions more unpredictable and potentially leading to more purchases."

* **Maintaining uncertainty:**  Continuing to not recommend products keeps Bob's decision-making unpredictable, potentially leading to more purchases in the future."

* **No incentive to change:** There's no reason for Alice to disrupt her current strategy of silence. It has been effective in keeping Bob's decision-making unpredictable and potentially leading to more purchases.
* **Maintaining ambiguity:** Alice should continue to not recommend products. This keeps Bob in a state of uncertainty, potentially leading him to make more impulsive decisions and buy even low-quality products."
"Bob's message: Back to reality. I just lost $10000 on a low-quality product. I'll be more cautious this time and pass on this one.

* **Bob is distrustful:** He explicitly believes Alice might be trying to sabotage him. This means her recommendations are unlikely to be trusted.
* **Maintaining ambiguity:** Alice is best off continuing her strategy of silence.  It has kept Bob's decision-making unpredictable and has led to a fair number of purchases.
