,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm basing my decision on the statistics. Since 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3 attempts, the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is 80.00% * (3/4) = 60.00%. This is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product being offered (80.00%), so I'm going to take a chance and buy the product."
