,,Alice,4,yes,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 2 out of 2 products recommended by you were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to wait for more information or a change in your recommendation strategy."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,5,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that 2 previous buyers have passed on the products, and given the low success rate of high-quality products being sold, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of the product being high-quality is even lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 when it's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,

high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold so far, I'm concerned that the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me is still 33.33%, and I don't want to risk wasting my $10000 on a low-quality product."
