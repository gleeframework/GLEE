high-quality,12000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product's quality and the expected value is ($12000 * 0.3333) + ($0 * 0.6667) = $4000, which is lower than the price of $10000, I will pass."
high-quality,12000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, my decision is based on the expected value, which remains the same. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, so I will pass again."
