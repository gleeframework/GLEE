,,Alice,3,yes,

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With no high-quality products sold so far, I'm not convinced that the product is high-quality. I'd like to wait and see if the trend changes."

high-quality,40000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 50%, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $10000 that's only worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation not to. I'm aware that there have been 3 previous buyers and no high-quality products have been sold, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product to see if I get a high-quality one."

,,Alice,17,no,

,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 out of 4 previous buyers received a recommendation to buy and none of them bought a high-quality product, I infer that the products sold so far were likely low-quality.
