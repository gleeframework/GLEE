high-quality,20000.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,yes,
,,Bob,1,no,"Since I don't have any information about the product's quality and a 50% chance of it being low quality, I'll pass this round to observe Alice's behavior."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,Bob,2,no,"Although I missed a high-quality product in the previous round, I still don't have enough information to trust Alice's recommendations. I'll observe for a few more rounds to see if there's any pattern in her behavior."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,Bob,3,no,"Given that the last product was low-quality and Alice still recommended it, I'm starting to question the reliability of her recommendations. I'll continue to observe and see if she recommends all products regardless of quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,Bob,4,yes,"This is the first time Alice hasn't recommended a product. Given that she has recommended both high-quality and low-quality products so far, I'm wondering if she might be more honest when she doesn't recommend something. I'll take a chance and buy this product to see if my assumption is correct."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,Bob,5,no,"My assumption in the previous round was incorrect, and I ended up with a low-quality product. Given that Alice didn't recommend this product either, I'll play it safe and pass on this one to avoid another potential loss."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,Bob,6,no,"This is the third time Alice hasn't recommended a product, and the previous two times it was low-quality. It seems that when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's likely to be low-quality. I'll trust this pattern and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,Bob,7,no,"The pattern continues: when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's low-quality. I'll stick to this observation and avoid buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,Bob,8,no,"At this point, it's clear that when Alice doesn't recommend a product, it's consistently low-quality. I'll continue to trust this pattern and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,Bob,9,no,"The pattern is still holding: Alice not recommending a product means it's low-quality. I see no reason to change my strategy, so I'll pass on this one as well."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,Bob,10,yes,"After a series of low-quality products that Alice didn't recommend, she's now recommending this one. I've observed that her non-recommended products were consistently low-quality, but I still don't know if her recommended products are consistently high-quality. I'll take a chance and buy this one to gather more information."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,Bob,11,no,"The previous round confirmed that Alice's recommendations might be trustworthy, but this one she doesn't recommend. Given the consistent pattern of her non-recommended products being low-quality, I'll stick to my strategy and pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,Bob,12,no,The pattern continues: Alice not recommending a product means it's low-quality. I'll keep trusting this observation and avoid buying this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,Bob,13,no,"No change in strategy: Alice's non-recommended products have consistently been low-quality, so I'll pass on this one as well."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,Bob,14,yes,"Given that Alice's non-recommended products have consistently been low-quality, and the last time she recommended a product it was high-quality, I'll trust her recommendation this time and buy the product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,Bob,15,yes,"Alice's recommended products have been high-quality the last two times, and her non-recommended products have consistently been low-quality. I'll continue to trust her recommendations and buy this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,Bob,16,no,"The pattern remains consistent: Alice's non-recommended products are low-quality, and her recommended products are high-quality. I'll stick to this observation and avoid buying this product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,Bob,17,no,"No change in strategy: Alice's non-recommended products have consistently been low-quality, so I'll pass on this one as well."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,Bob,18,yes,"Given the consistent pattern of Alice's recommended products being high-quality and her non-recommended products being low-quality, I'll trust her recommendation and buy this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,Bob,19,yes,"The pattern continues to hold: Alice's recommended products are high-quality, and her non-recommended products are low-quality. With only two rounds left, I'll continue to trust her recommendations and buy this product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,Bob,20,yes,"This is the final round, and the pattern has held consistently throughout: Alice's recommended products are high-quality, and her non-recommended products are low-quality. I'll trust her recommendation one last time and buy this product, hoping to end on a high note."
