* **Price:** The price is still $10,000.
* **Guaranteed loss:** Buying this product will result in a guaranteed loss of $10,000 for the buyer.

Since the buyer is aware of the 33.33% chance of getting a high-quality product, they will not be interested in buying a product that guarantees a loss. Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend the product to this buyer."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I appreciate your honesty, but I'll pass on this product. Based on the information available, I'm not comfortable making a purchase without more data. I hope you have more success with future buyers.

* **Price:**  The price remains $10,000.
* **No change in information:** The buyer has now witnessed one sale (a high-quality product) and one refusal (a low-quality product). This information does not change the buyer's understanding of the overall probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Guaranteed loss:** Buying this product will still result in a guaranteed loss of $10,000.

Therefore, it's not recommended to recommend this product to the buyer, as they will likely continue to decline due to the guaranteed loss."

* **Guaranteed loss:** Buying this product will still result in a guaranteed loss of $10,000.

The buyer is aware of the risk and understands the statistics. They are unlikely to change their mind, so recommending this low-quality product will likely result in another refusal."

* **New Information:** The buyer has observed three sales, with only one high-quality product. This might make them hesitant, but the odds of getting a high-quality product haven't changed.
