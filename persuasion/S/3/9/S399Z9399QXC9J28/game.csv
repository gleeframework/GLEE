high-quality,120.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them were high-quality products. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being recommended is lower than the overall probability of a high-quality product existing. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."

high-quality,120.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, so she's trying to get me to buy a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,

,,Alice,10,no,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 3 out of 3 products were low quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of this product and don't want to risk buying it."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,

high-quality,120.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers bought a high-quality product, I'm going to pass on this one. I think it's likely to be a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are not reliable, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. I'm not sure if the current product is high-quality, so I'll pass on it to get more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have already passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, I'm concerned that the product might be low quality. I'd like to see more information about the products before making a purchase."

I'd like to pass on this opportunity and see if the next product is better."
