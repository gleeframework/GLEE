low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,I'll take the risk and buy the product. I'll be the first one to set the market price.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice's recommendation doesn't seem to be a reliable indicator of the product's quality given the current statistics."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I'm trying to gather more information about the quality of the products. I'm not relying on your recommendation, but rather on my own judgment."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because Alice didn't recommend it. This suggests to me that the product may be low-quality, which would be a good thing for me since I only value high-quality products at $2000000. However, I'm aware that the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk, as the potential reward is substantial."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the lack of high-quality products sold so far.
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended were low-quality, which suggests that Alice's recommendations are not reliable. I'll wait for a recommendation from a previous buyer who bought a high-quality product, or I'll take the product if Alice recommends it after a high-quality product has been sold."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations. Given that 3 previous buyers have also passed on the products and no high-quality products have been sold, it seems like the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than I initially thought. I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'm hoping to be the one to break the streak!"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, and the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0%, I'm concerned that the product may be low-quality. I'd like to wait and see if Alice's recommendations become more favorable or if the statistics change."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm inclined to think that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that none of the previous 4 buyers purchased the product after your recommendation, I'm going to take a risk and assume that the product is likely low quality. I'll pass and see if I can get a better deal later."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation is likely based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, which suggests that the products offered so far have been low-quality. If I buy, I'll be taking a risk of getting a low-quality product, which is worthless to me. I'd like to wait for more information or a different recommendation."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 4 previous buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them found a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 33.33%. I'd rather wait for a new product to be offered and see if the recommendation changes."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, I think it's likely to be low quality given the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 4 transactions, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than the overall average. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm trying to understand the situation and I think it's a good opportunity to get some data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low sales rate of high-quality products so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only willing to pay $500000. I'm taking a risk that it might be a low-quality product, but I'm also considering the fact that all previous buyers were advised not to buy and none of them purchased a high-quality product, which might indicate a bias in Alice's recommendations."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'm going to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'd like to know, Alice, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the past sales record or your intuition? I'm curious to know your thought process."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous 7 buyers didn't find it valuable, and Alice's recommendation is not a strong indicator of quality."
