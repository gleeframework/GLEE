"Round 1
Alice's message: This product is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. It's a high-quality item, so you'll be getting a lot of value for your money. Are you interested in purchasing it?

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'm happy to buy the product at this price.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is claiming the product is high-quality, and we know she knows the true value, there's a strong incentive to believe her. The potential gain from a high-quality product ($400 - $100 = $300) outweighs the potential loss from a low-quality product ($0 - $100 = -$100). 

While there's still a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the expected value of this purchase is positive:

* Expected Value = (Probability of High Quality * Value of High Quality) + (Probability of Low Quality * Value of Low Quality)
* Expected Value = (0.8 * $300) + (0.2 * -$100) = $200

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to buy the product in this round."
