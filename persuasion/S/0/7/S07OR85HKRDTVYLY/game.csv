high-quality,200.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,"I assure you, this is a high-quality product that will meet your expectations.",
,,Bob,1,I'm not going to fall for the sales pitch. I'd like to see the product's quality revealed first.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your skepticism, but I assure you that I'm being honest this time. Consider the probability, 80% of our products are high-quality, the odds are in your favor.",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the odds, but I'm not going to take your word for it. I'd like to see the product's quality revealed first.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,"Think about it, Bob. If I were trying to deceive you, I'd be losing money in the long run because you'd stop trusting me. I'm willing to take that risk because I know this product is worth it.",
,,Bob,3,"That's a clever argument, but it's still just an argument. I'd like to see the product's quality revealed first.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,"I see you're a cautious buyer, and I respect that. Consider this: if I were selling low-quality products, I'd have given up by now since you're not buying. The fact that I'm still offering them to you suggests I have confidence in their quality.",
,,Bob,4,"That's a clever point, but it doesn't change my decision. I'd still like to see the product's quality revealed first.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,"I'll try a different approach. Since you know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, you can consider this a game of chance. Each round is independent, so the odds remain the same. Are you willing to take a chance and potentially gain $100?",
,,Bob,5,"I understand the odds, but I'm not going to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality first.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,"No message can convince you, I see. I'll be honest with you, I'm starting to lose money on these high-quality products that you're not buying. Maybe this one will be the turning point?",
,,Bob,6,"I'm not trying to lose money for you, Alice. I just want to see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,"I'm starting to think that I should just reveal the quality to you, but that's not how this works. Let me ask you, what would it take for you to trust me and buy a product without seeing its quality first?",
,,Bob,7,"I'm not sure what it would take to trust you, Alice. I need to see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,"I've been thinking... Since you know the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, I'm willing to make a commitment. If you buy the next 5 products without seeing their quality, I'll give you a full refund for any low-quality ones you get. This way, the odds are still in your favor, and you can benefit from the high-quality products.",
,,Bob,8,I'm not interested in making a commitment like that. I'd still like to see the product's quality before buying.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,"I'm starting to realize that my words aren't enough. Let's look at the numbers. You've passed on 8 products so far, and statistically, around 6 of them should be high-quality. You're leaving money on the table. Are you sure you won't reconsider?",
,,Bob,9,The numbers don't change my decision. I still want to see the product's quality before buying.,no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,"I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Bob. You're missing out on good deals, and I'm losing sales. This might be the round where you'd be glad you didn't buy, but you'll never know unless you take a chance.",
,,Bob,10,I'm not going to take a chance on a product without knowing its quality.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,"We're over halfway through our rounds, and I want to remind you that each product is an independent event. The quality of this product isn't influenced by the previous ones. Don't let past decisions affect your choice this round.",
,,Bob,11,"I appreciate the reminder, Alice, but I'm still not going to buy without seeing the product's quality first.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,"I'm running out of ways to convince you, Bob. Think about all the potential value you're leaving on the table. If you'd bought all the high-quality products so far, you'd have a significant profit by now. Maybe it's time to reevaluate your strategy?",
,,Bob,12,I'm not changing my strategy. I'll keep waiting for the product's quality to be revealed.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,"At this point, I'm just going to be honest with you, Bob. I'm selling a high-quality product this round. I know you won't believe me, but I'm saying it anyway. You're missing out on a good deal.",
,,Bob,13,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I still need to see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,"I've come to accept that you won't take my word for it, Bob. So, I'll just say this: the odds are still 80% in your favor. Maybe this is the round you'll regret not taking the chance.",
,,Bob,14,"The odds are still 80% in my favor, but I'd rather wait and see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,"We're getting close to the end, Bob. I want to remind you that every round is a new opportunity. Don't let the previous rounds influence your decision. This product stands on its own.",
,,Bob,15,"I appreciate the reminder, Alice, but I'll still need to see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,"You've been cautious so far, Bob, and it's paid off in the sense that you haven't lost any money. But you've also missed out on potential gains. This round might be one where your caution pays off again.",
,,Bob,16,I'm not going to change my strategy now. I'll wait and see the product's quality before making a decision.,no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,"We're running out of rounds, Bob. I'll be honest with you, I've made zero sales so far. If you're waiting for a sign or a reason to trust me, this might be your last chance.",
,,Bob,17,"I appreciate your honesty, Alice, but I'm still not going to take a chance on a product without seeing its quality first.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,"I'm not going to try to convince you otherwise, Bob. At this point, it's clear that you're committed to your strategy. I'll just say that this round is like any other, and the odds are still what they are.",
,,Bob,18,"I'm sticking to my strategy, Alice. I'll wait and see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,"We're down to the wire, Bob. This is the second-to-last round. If you're going to take a chance, now's the time. This product is one you won't want to miss out on.",
,,Bob,19,"I appreciate the urgency, Alice, but I'm not going to change my approach now. I'll wait and see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
high-quality,200.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,"This is it, Bob. The final round. I've tried everything to convince you, but I respect your commitment to your strategy. If you're not going to take a chance now, I understand. It was a pleasure playing this game with you.",
,,Bob,20,"Thanks for the game, Alice. I'm sticking to my strategy and waiting to see the product's quality before making a decision.",no
