,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that your recommendation is against it. I'll take the risk and make my own decision based on the equal probability of high and low quality products."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product and see the quality before deciding to buy. I'm concerned that the previous buyer didn't buy the product despite your recommendation, and I'd like to make my own decision based on the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'm going to buy it anyway, because if I pass, it will be discarded and I won't have any information about its quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record and Alice's recommendation. I'm not sure if I should take the risk given the low recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality item."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware that the probability of it being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it's likely that the product is low quality. I'd rather wait for the next product and see if Alice's recommendation changes or if more information becomes available."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low number of high-quality products sold so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,120.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation based on the current statistics. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 4 purchases, it seems like the products you've recommended so far have been low-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, as Alice doesn't recommend it and there's a high chance it might be low-quality given the previous sales record."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the proportion of high-quality products sold is still 0. This suggests that the previous buyers may have been passing on low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $100."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, given your recommendation and the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that none of the previous 4 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, it's likely that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is higher than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for a product that has been purchased by at least one buyer to get a better sense of the quality distribution."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you're not recommending it. I'm hoping it's a low-quality product and I can get a good deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold might be lower than the true probability of 33.33%. This is a potential anomaly, and I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and the high proportion of low-quality products suggested by the previous buyers' purchases."
high-quality,120.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5, the probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd like to pass and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."

,,Alice,20,yes,
