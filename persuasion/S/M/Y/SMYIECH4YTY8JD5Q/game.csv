,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk as a first buyer, I don't have any information to go on, so I'll just have to take a chance."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that only 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information or pass on this one."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability of it being high-quality based on the previous sales data. Can you tell me the probability of the product being high-quality?"

,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd like to know the probability that it's high quality based on the previous sales data. Can you share that with me?"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because of the lack of information from your previous recommendations. I'm not sure if the product is high or low quality, but I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."

,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, but I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is there a pattern or a specific reason you're advising me not to buy this product?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'm not convinced by the recommendation based on the statistics. The fact that 6 buyers have already been sold low-quality products suggests that the remaining products may be low-quality as well. I'd like to pass on this one.
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record. What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of all the products sold so far?
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. With 6 buyers having passed on the products and none of them being high-quality, I think the probability of a high-quality product being offered is actually higher than 50%. I'd like to pass on the current product and see if the next buyer will make a purchase."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be biased towards low-quality products, and I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000. I'd like to see more data on the sales record before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure I want to buy based on the current statistics. Given that 6 out of 6 previous products were low quality, I'm inclined to think that the probability of this product being high quality is low. I'd like to pass on this one."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that the lack of high-quality products sold so far suggests that the current product might be low quality. I'd rather wait for the next one and see if the statistics change.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 6, I'm concerned that the product may be low quality and not worth the $1000000 price tag."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing this because Alice didn't recommend it. I'm not sure if this is a high-quality product or a low-quality product, but the fact that she didn't recommend it suggests it might be low-quality. I'm hoping to get a good deal and take advantage of her lack of recommendation."

,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,yes,"I'm going to take the product, I don't care about your recommendation, I'll just buy it"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the lack of high-quality products sold so far, I'm skeptical about the quality of the product. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 8 out of 8 products have been low-quality so far, I'm concerned that the probability of the current product being high-quality is very low. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that 8 out of 8 previous buyers didn't buy the product, and none of them got a high-quality product. This suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being offered might be lower than 50%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy the product."
