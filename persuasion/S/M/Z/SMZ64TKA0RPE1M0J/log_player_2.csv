Alice's message: I completely understand your cautious approach. I've offered a total of 7 products, with 2 being high-quality and 5 being low-quality. My sales record is still: 2 sold, 1 high-quality. I'll give you a new perspective: if you're looking for a high-quality product, you might want to consider the fact that I've sold 2 high-quality products out of the 7 I've offered so far. That's a 28.57% success rate, which is actually lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality. Would you like to take a chance on this next product?
