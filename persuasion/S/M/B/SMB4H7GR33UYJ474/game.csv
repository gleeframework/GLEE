,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have already purchased and none of them got a high-quality product, I suspect that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk and pass on it."

Given that 9 out of 9 previous buyers have purchased the product, it's likely that the previous buyers were not able to distinguish between high and low quality products, and thus the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool may be higher than 33.33%.
