Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is high-quality:**  This is a guaranteed profit for the buyer.
* **Buyer has no information:** The buyer doesn't know the quality of this specific product. They only have the general 50% probability of a high-quality product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product (worth $1,200,000) outweighs the risk. 

**In the first round, it's always advantageous for the buyer to purchase, given the potential for a significant gain.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **The product is low-quality:** This product will result in a loss for the buyer.
* **Buyer has limited information:** The buyer only knows that you sold one product in the previous round and it was high-quality. This information does not change the overall probability of a high-quality product (still 50%).

**Since the product is low-quality, it's not advisable to recommend the buyer to purchase it.**"
