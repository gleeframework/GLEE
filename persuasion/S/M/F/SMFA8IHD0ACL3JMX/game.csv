,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I don't have any information about the quality of the product, and I'd like to wait for more data before making a decision."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,yes,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, as I don't have any information about the product's quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, I don't have any prior information to go by, so I'll just take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'm not going to buy the product based on your recommendation, but I'm curious, what made you recommend against it?"
high-quality,400.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to pass on the product and see if the next buyer will buy it. I want to gather more information about the quality of the products before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the number of products sold and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation given the low number of sales and no high-quality products sold yet.
high-quality,400.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to buy a potentially low-quality product for $100 when it's not worth anything to me. I'd like to see more data on the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me the probability that it's high-quality based on the current data."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, 2 out of 2 products were low-quality, which is a strong indication that the probability of a high-quality product is low. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, I'm inclined to pass on this one. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I've seen that none of the previous buyers bought a high-quality product, which suggests that the probability of this product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I don't have any information to go on and Alice's recommendation is not based on my personal value of the product. I'm making an uninformed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the quality of the product, and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"Based on the fact that Alice does not recommend the product and no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm going to pass on this one. I want to see more data before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the current statistics, 4 out of 4 products have been low-quality. The probability of the current product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'm skeptical about the product's quality and will pass on it."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your previous recommendations, but I'm the 5th buyer and there are no high-quality products sold yet. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm a rational buyer, and I don't trust your recommendation. I know the probability of the product being high-quality is 33.33% and I'm willing to take the risk."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, and I don't want to be the one to break the streak of low-quality products."
high-quality,400.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,yes,
,,the buyer,20,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers have purchased the products despite the lack of high-quality products sold, I suspect that the probability of a high-quality product being offered has decreased. I'll wait for the next product to see if the probability of a high-quality product increases."
