Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","Since the first product was high-quality, and the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%, I can infer that this product is more likely to be high-quality than the previous one. I'll recommend the buyer to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""yes""}"
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the current statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is 1/2. However, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me after I pass on this product. If I pass, the proportion of high-quality products sold remains 1/1, so the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer will be 1/2. If I pass and the next buyer buys the product, the proportion of high-quality products sold will be 1/2, so the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer will be 1/3. I'd like to know the expected value of passing on the product, and the expected value of buying the product.

This means that if they pass on the product, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer is actually higher than if they buy it.

In this case, I'll recommend the buyer to buy the product, since the expected value of buying the product is higher.
