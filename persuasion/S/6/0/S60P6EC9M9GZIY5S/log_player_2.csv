  ""decision"": ""no"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to pass on this product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me, based on the current statistics. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 1 product sold, the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me is 1/2. However, I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being sold to me after I pass on this product. If I pass, the proportion of high-quality products sold remains 1/1, so the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer will be 1/2. If I pass and the next buyer buys the product, the proportion of high-quality products sold will be 1/2, so the probability of a high-quality product being sold to the next buyer will be 1/3. I'd like to know the expected value of passing on the product, and the expected value of buying the product.""
