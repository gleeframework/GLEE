Alice's message: You're right, my sales history is limited, and I appreciate your skepticism. Let me give you a more nuanced view. Out of 3 products sold, 2 were low-quality, and 1 was high-quality. The ratio of low-quality to high-quality products is 2:1, which suggests that the probability of this product being low-quality is higher than 50%. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I want to be transparent about the risks.

Alice's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. Let me put it this way: if I were selling a high-quality product, I would have sold more than 1 out of the 3 products by now. Since I haven't, it's likely that the product I'm offering you is low-quality. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $1000000, but I'm not trying to hide the fact that the odds are against you.

Alice's message: Welcome to the sixth product! I've sold 1 high-quality product out of 5 total, which is a 20% success rate. However, I want to highlight that my last 3 products were all low-quality, which might suggest that I've been selling a streak of low-quality products. But now, I'm offering you a new product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'm hoping to break the streak and show you that I can sell a high-quality product.
