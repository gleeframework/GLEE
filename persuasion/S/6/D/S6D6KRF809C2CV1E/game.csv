low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"You're considering buying from me for the second time. I've sold 0 high-quality products and 2 low-quality products so far. The probability of a high-quality product hasn't changed, but the data suggests that my products are more likely to be low-quality. I'm still offering the product for $10000. Do you want to take a chance?",

I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to deceive you, but I do want to point out that the $10000 price tag is a significant investment. Are you willing to take the risk and buy this product?",
