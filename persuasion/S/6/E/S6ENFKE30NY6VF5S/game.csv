high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased because she has an incentive to sell a high-quality product to me, and she has no information about my valuation. I'd rather wait and observe more sales to get a better understanding of the product's quality."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's likely that the product is low-quality. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000 when it's worth $0 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 1, the proportion of high-quality products is 0%. This is lower than the overall probability of a product being high-quality (80%). I'm going to take a cautious approach and pass on this product to see if future sales reveal more information about the distribution of high-quality products."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I would like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, and she is trying to increase the chances of selling a high-quality product. However, given the low probability of a high-quality product (20%), I think it's better to pass on it and see if the next product is of higher quality."

,,Alice,16,yes,
