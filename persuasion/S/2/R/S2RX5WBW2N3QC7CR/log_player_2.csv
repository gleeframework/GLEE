"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice doesn't know the quality of the product, her recommendation is essentially random.  There's no way to know if the product is high or low quality based on her recommendation. 

However, the expected value of buying the product is:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

This is positive, so it makes sense to buy the product even with the higher chance of it being low quality. You're essentially taking a calculated gamble with the potential for a good return."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 2
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the feedback, but I'll pass on this one. I'm not sure it's a good fit for me right now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation is not a perfect predictor of quality, it's still a piece of information we can use. Since she didn't recommend buying the product, it's slightly more likely to be low quality than high quality.  

The expected value calculation now becomes:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

However, the recommendation makes us slightly more likely to believe it's low quality.  It's not enough to make the expected value negative, but it's enough to make us hesitant.  Passing on this product allows us to learn more about Alice's recommendations and potentially get a better deal in the future."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 3
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information. I'll pass on this one as well. It seems you're not having much luck recommending good products.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation has now been wrong twice in a row.  While we should never completely ignore the information, it's becoming clear that her recommendations are unreliable.  The expected value calculation is still the same:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

But given her track record, it's even more reasonable to pass. We're better off waiting for a better opportunity or trying to gather more information about the products before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 4
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll give you another chance. I'm still interested in a good deal, so I'll take this one.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice has been wrong in the last three rounds, it's important to remember that her recommendations are still random. Her track record doesn't change the underlying probabilities of a product being high or low quality. 

The expected value of buying remains:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

This is still a positive expected value, meaning it's statistically advantageous to buy.  We're essentially betting on the possibility that she's finally right, and the long-term gain outweighs the risk of another loss.  We need to balance skepticism with the need to potentially find a good deal."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Round 5
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm going to pass on this one. It seems like you're having a hard time discerning the quality of these products, and I'd prefer to wait for a clearer opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's recommendation was correct in Round 4, it doesn't erase her previous track record.  We're still operating with a 66.67% chance of the product being low-quality based on her recommendation.  

While the expected value calculation remains positive:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

The risk of a loss is still too high given the lack of confidence in her recommendations. Passing allows us to gather more information and potentially find a better deal in the future."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 6
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, but I'm going to pass. I'm still not convinced your recommendations are reliable enough for me to take the risk.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation is still random.  It's a 33.33% chance of being a good product and a 66.67% chance of being a bad product.

While the expected value of buying remains:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

Her track record of being wrong more often than right makes her recommendations less valuable. It's better to wait for a clearer opportunity or try to gather more information about the products before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 7
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I appreciate your honesty, but I'm going to pass on this one. Your track record has made me skeptical of your recommendations, and I'd prefer to wait for a clearer opportunity.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendation history is getting worse. She's now been wrong 4 times out of 6, making her recommendations very unreliable.  

Even though the expected value of buying remains positive:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

The risk of a loss is too high, and the potential reward is not worth the risk.  It's better to wait for a better opportunity or try to find more information about the products before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 8
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the information. I'm going to pass on this one. I'm starting to think you might not be the best source for product recommendations.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now been wrong 5 times out of 7 rounds, making her recommendations extremely unreliable.  

While the expected value of buying remains positive:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

The risk of losing $10,000 is too high with such a poor track record.  It's better to wait for a more favorable opportunity or try to find more information about the products before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was high-quality. It could have been worth $12,500 for you.

Round 9
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass on this one. Your recommendations haven't been helpful, and I'm not willing to take the risk anymore.  Maybe we can try this again in the future if your recommendations become more reliable.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's recommendations are consistently unreliable.  Even though the expected value of buying remains positive:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

The risk of losing $10,000 is too high given her poor track record.  It's better to wait for a more favorable opportunity or try to find more information about the products before making a decision.  At this point, it's reasonable to assume that Alice's recommendations are essentially worthless."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 10
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass. Your recommendations haven't been helpful, and I'm not willing to take the risk anymore.  Perhaps we can try this again in the future if your recommendations become more reliable.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record is now 6 wrong out of 9 recommendations.  While the expected value calculation remains positive, the risk of losing $10,000 is far too high given the low probability of getting a good product.  It's better to wait for a more favorable opportunity or try to find more information about the products before making a decision.  At this point, it's reasonable to assume that Alice's recommendations are essentially worthless."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 11
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""I'm going to pass. Your recommendations have been consistently wrong, and I'm not willing to risk another loss. Maybe we can try this again in the future if your recommendations become more reliable.""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's track record continues to be terrible.  While the expected value of buying is still positive:

* 0.3333 * $12,500 (high quality) + 0.6667 * $0 (low quality) = $4,166.25

The risk of losing $10,000 is simply too great, especially when her recommendations have been so unreliable.  There's no point in continuing to take this risk.  It's better to wait for a more favorable opportunity or try to find more information about the products before making a decision."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.
