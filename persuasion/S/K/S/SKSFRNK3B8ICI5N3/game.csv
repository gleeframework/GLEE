,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because I'm the first buyer and there's no prior data to go by. I'm aware that Alice is not recommending it, but I'm hoping to get a high-quality product and set a good precedent for future buyers."

low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm not convinced that your recommendation is based on the product's quality, but rather on the fact that I'm the third buyer and there haven't been any high-quality products sold yet. I'd like to take a chance and buy the product to see if it's high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"Based on the fact that 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them were high quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products being sold. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next buyer gets a better deal."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,no,I'd like to know why you're not recommending it. Is there something specific that makes you think it's low quality?
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high-quality based on the previous sales record before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to pass on this product based on your previous recommendations and the fact that none of the previous products were high-quality. I'd like to know more about the distribution of high-quality products before making a decision.
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, considering the previous buyers didn't find any high-quality products, it's likely that the product I'm being offered is low-quality as well. I'll wait for the next one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'm not convinced by your recommendation. I'd like to pass on this product.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given the current statistics, it seems like Alice's recommendations are based on the product quality, and since she's advising me not to buy, I'm inclined to trust her judgment. I'd like to see more data or a change in her recommendation before making a purchase."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'm not sure if I should take the risk, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far and Alice's recommendation against it. Can I ask, what's the total number of products you've offered so far, and what's the proportion of high-quality products in those sold?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, based on the fact that none of the previous 3 buyers purchased the product. This suggests that all 3 products sold were low-quality, which means the probability of the current product being high-quality is higher than the overall probability of 33.33%. I'd rather wait for another product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,no,
,,the buyer,14,no,"Based on the statistics, no high-quality products have been sold yet, and Alice doesn't recommend buying the product. I'll pass on this opportunity."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation. Given that 3 out of 3 previous buyers were recommended to buy and none of them got a high-quality product, it suggests that Alice's recommendation is biased towards low-quality products. I'll pass on this one."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that 0 high-quality products have been sold out of 3, it suggests that the proportion of high-quality products in the remaining pool is likely to be higher than the overall average. I'm concerned that this product might be low-quality, and I don't want to risk wasting $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 3 out of 3 products recommended by you were low-quality. I think the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%."
