Alice's message: This is a great opportunity to buy a product from a reputable seller like myself. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 1 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is very low. I'm offering it to you for $10000, a steal considering the low expected value. What do you say?

Alice's message: I see you're a savvy buyer. You're right to be cautious. I've sold 0 high-quality products out of 2 so far, which means the probability of this product being high-quality is still very low. But think about it, if I was trying to scam you, wouldn't I have sold at least one high-quality product by now? I'm offering you a chance to get in on the ground floor of my sales, and I'm willing to sell this product to you for $10000. It's a risk, but it could pay off big time. What do you say?
