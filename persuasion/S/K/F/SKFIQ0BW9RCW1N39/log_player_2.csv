**Explanation:**

Since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, the fact that one high-quality product has been sold is a positive sign. Given that Alice is recommending the product, it is likely she has seen some indication that it is high quality.  The potential reward of $200 outweighs the risk of losing $100, so buying is the rational choice."

**Reasoning:**

The information provided is extremely positive. All 7 previous buyers who purchased the product received a high-quality item. This suggests that Alice might have a way to identify high-quality products, even though she claims she doesn't know the quality upfront.  While there's still a chance the current product could be low quality, the data strongly suggests it's worth the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 8 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 8 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 9th buyer!
