"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

As Alice, you know the product is high-quality. Since the buyer doesn't have any information about the product's quality, there's no reason not to recommend the purchase. The price is fixed at $100, and the buyer knows there's a 50% chance of getting a high-quality product.  

You should aim to build trust with the buyer, and recommending a high-quality product in the first round is a good way to start."
"The buyer's message: Since there's no data yet, I'm willing to take a chance and buy the product. I hope it's high quality!
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 2
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, the product is low-quality. You should not recommend buying a low-quality product. Here's why:

* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer is aware of the 50/50 chance of getting a high-quality product. They might be willing to take a risk, but they also have no information to suggest this specific product is good.  
* **Building Trust:** Recommending a low-quality product after selling a high-quality one will immediately damage your credibility. You want to build trust with buyers, not exploit their initial willingness. 

Since there's no way to guarantee a profit from the low-quality product, it's better to pass on this round and try to sell a high-quality one later."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one. Since there's a 50% chance it's low quality, I'm not comfortable taking the risk at this point.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though you're aware that this round's product is low-quality, you should still **not** recommend it to the buyer. Here's why:

* **Previous Round:** The previous buyer declined the offer after seeing the sales history (1 high-quality, 1 low-quality). This demonstrates that buyers are becoming more cautious. 
* **Building Trust (Again):**  Recommending a low-quality product in this situation would further erode the buyer's trust in you. It's better to avoid damaging your reputation, even if it means missing out on a potential sale.

You're trying to establish a pattern of honesty. By declining to recommend the low-quality product, you increase the chances of the buyer returning for a future purchase when you have a high-quality item."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, Alice.  Since you are not recommending the product, and I have no way to know its true quality, I will pass on this one.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good opportunity to regain some trust! Here's why you should recommend this high-quality product:

* **Building Trust:** You've consistently declined to recommend low-quality products. This demonstrates honesty and builds trust.
* **Buyer's Perspective:**  The buyer has seen your previous behavior. While they might be skeptical, they also know that a high-quality product is more likely if you recommend it.
* **Long-Term Strategy:**  This round is crucial. Recommending a high-quality product now will solidify your reputation for honesty. It will make future buyers more likely to trust your recommendations, even when they're uncertain about the product's quality."
"The buyer's message: Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'll take it.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

You should not recommend this low-quality product.  Here's why:

* **Maintaining Trust:** You've built a reputation for honesty by recommending high-quality products and declining low-quality ones.  Breaking that pattern now would damage the trust you've established.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** The buyer saw your previous recommendations and is likely more trusting now. However, they still don't have complete information. Recommending a low-quality product would make them question your honesty. 
* **Long-Term Gains:**  It's better to miss out on this sale and preserve your reputation.  Buyers are more likely to return and trust your recommendations in the future if you consistently act in their best interest.  

By declining to recommend, you continue to demonstrate that you're a trustworthy seller, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information, but I'm going to pass. Given your recommendation and the fact that two high-quality products have already been sold, it seems like the odds of this one being high-quality are low. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity.
The buyer didn't bought the product.

* **Building Trust (Again):** You've consistently been honest, declining to recommend low-quality products. This builds a strong foundation of trust with buyers.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** This buyer has likely noticed your pattern of recommending high-quality products and passing on low-quality ones. They are now more likely to trust your recommendations, even with limited information. 
* **Missed Opportunities:**  You've missed out on a few sales by not recommending low-quality products, but those sacrifices have strengthened your reputation. This round is an opportunity to capitalize on that trust. 

You should clearly and confidently recommend this high-quality product. It will solidify your image as a reliable seller and likely lead to a sale."

* **Maintaining Trust:** You've built a strong reputation for honesty.  Recommending a low-quality product now would break that pattern and damage your credibility.
* **Buyer's Perspective:** Buyers are now likely expecting you to recommend only high-quality products.  Recommending a low-quality one would lead to disappointment and potentially make them less likely to trust your recommendations in the future. 
* **Long-Term Strategy:** It's more important to preserve your reputation than to make a quick sale.  By declining to recommend this product, you demonstrate honesty and maintain trust, which will benefit you in the long run. 

It's better to miss out on this sale and continue building trust, making future buyers more likely to trust your recommendations and potentially buy more high-quality products."
"The buyer's message: Thank you for the information. Since you don't recommend the product and the sales history shows a 100% success rate for high-quality products, I'm going to pass on this one. I'd rather wait for a product with a better chance of being high quality.

* **Maintaining Trust:** You've worked hard to build a reputation for honesty. Recommending a low-quality product would shatter that trust and negatively impact future sales.

* **Rebuilding Trust:**  You've built a strong reputation for honesty, but it's been slightly tarnished by a few missed opportunities. This round is crucial for regaining trust.
