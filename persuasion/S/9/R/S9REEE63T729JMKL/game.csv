,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'll take the risk, I don't have any information to go on, and I'm willing to pay $10000 for the chance to get a $20000 product."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,yes,
,,the buyer,2,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that no high-quality products have been sold so far, I think it's more likely that the product is low-quality. I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality, considering the previous sales record."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, but I'm curious, Alice, what's the basis for your recommendation? Is it based on the previous buyer's experience or the overall sales record?"
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the previous buyer also passed and no high-quality products have been sold yet, which suggests that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than expected. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,
,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, as the previous buyer didn't find it valuable, and I don't have enough information to trust your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. I'm aware of the 0% success rate of high-quality products being sold so far, but I also know that the probability of a product being high-quality is 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,no,I'd like to know the probability of the product being high quality based on the previous sales record and your recommendation.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, but I'd like to know why you don't think this product is worth buying."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing so because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet. I'm hoping that the law of large numbers will kick in and the next product will be high quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"Based on the current statistics, there have been 3 buyers, and none of them have purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the products Alice has been offering are likely to be low-quality. Given that Alice is not recommending the product, I will pass on it to avoid the potential loss of $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, especially given that no high-quality products have been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

high-quality,20000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being selected is lower than 33.33%. Given the recommendation, I'm skeptical about the product's quality and would rather not risk the $10000."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 3 out of the first 3 products were low-quality, I'm skeptical about the quality of the products and the accuracy of your recommendations. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,20000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 3 buyers have purchased the product and none of them got a high-quality one, I'm concerned that the product I'm being offered is likely to be low-quality. I'd like to see more information about the product before making a decision."
