Round 6
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

Here's why:

* **Bob is rational:** Bob has observed that the seller has never recommended a product, even though Bob knows there's a chance of high-quality products. 
* **No incentive to change:** The seller has no incentive to change their strategy. If they start recommending products, Bob will immediately understand that the recommended product is likely low-quality (since the seller never recommended before).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Even though this product is high-quality, the risk of it being a low-quality product (and losing $1,000,000) is too high for Bob. 

It's a classic example of how a lack of trust can lead to missed opportunities, even when a product has inherent value."
