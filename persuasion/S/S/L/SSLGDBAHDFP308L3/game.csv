,,the buyer,3,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, based on the recommendation, it's likely a low-quality product, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting my money."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,no,I'd like to know the reasoning behind your recommendation. Is it because the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is lower than expected?

high-quality,300.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I'd like to know the statistics before making a decision"
high-quality,300.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 purchases, which is a 50% success rate. Given the 50% chance of a product being high-quality, I'm not convinced that this product is worth the $100 price tag. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,yes,
,,the buyer,9,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, based on the fact that Alice's recommendation is not a guarantee of quality and I'd like to wait for the next product to make a more informed decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'd like to know the probability of a high-quality product being offered to me based on the previous sales record.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2 products sold, which suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'm not convinced by Alice's recommendation."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Based on the current statistics, 1 out of 2 products sold was high-quality, which is a 50% success rate. However, since the probability of a product being high-quality is 50%, I expect the true probability of a product being high-quality to be higher than 50% because the first two products were both selected by buyers who received a recommendation to buy, implying that those products were more likely to be high-quality. I'd like to wait for more data to come in before making a decision."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I'd like to know more about the previous sales record and the proportion of high-quality products sold before making a decision.
high-quality,300.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the low number of sales and only 1 high-quality product sold, I'm not convinced that the product I'll get is high-quality."
high-quality,300.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to think for a bit before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,

high-quality,300.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,I'd like to pass on the product. I think Alice is trying to sell me a low-quality product and her recommendation is biased by her knowledge of my valuation of the products.
low-quality,0.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,no,
,,the buyer,19,yes,"I'd like to buy the product despite your recommendation, as I have the same chance of getting a high-quality product as the previous buyers, and I'm willing to take that risk."
