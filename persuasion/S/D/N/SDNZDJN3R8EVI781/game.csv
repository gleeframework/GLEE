low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because I'm the 5th buyer and Alice hasn't recommended it, not because of any confidence in its quality. I'm hoping that the lack of recommendation is due to the product being low quality, which would be in line with the 0 high-quality products sold so far."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of them have purchased a high-quality product, I'm inclined to think that the products being recommended are likely to be low-quality. I'd rather wait for a product that hasn't been recommended yet."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. I'm not sure if it's high or low quality, but given that 5 previous buyers didn't find it valuable enough to buy, I'm inclined to think it might be low quality. I'd like to see more data or get a new product to consider."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 5 out of 5 previous buyers received low-quality products, I suspect the products sold so far have been low-quality. I'm not convinced that the product you're recommending is high-quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'd like to pass on this product based on your recommendation. However, I'm a bit concerned that all previous buyers have passed on the products after your recommendation, and none of them were high-quality. This might indicate that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to know if you can provide more information about your decision-making process and how you determine whether a product is high-quality or low-quality."
high-quality,12500.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that none of the previous 5 buyers have purchased a high-quality product, I'm concerned that this product might also be low quality. I'd like to wait and see if the pattern holds, or if the next buyer gets a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Given that you don't recommend it, I'll assume there's a high chance it's low quality, and I don't want to take the risk of wasting $10000 on a product worth $0 to me."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I'm concerned that the products sold so far were all low-quality. I'd like to pass on this one and see if the next product is any better."

,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, I think it's likely that the products Alice has been selling are low-quality. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is any better."
