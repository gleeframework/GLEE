high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,yes,

high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,yes,
,,the buyer,8,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation. I'm aware that you've recommended 2 high-quality products to the previous buyers, but I'm not convinced that the third product will be high-quality. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by your recommendation, and I'd like to see more information before making a decision."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products is 1/3. The probability of this product being high-quality is 0.8 * (1/3) = 0.2667. The probability of it being low-quality is 0.2 * (1/3) = 0.0667. However, considering Alice's recommendation, I'm going to assume that she knows something I don't. If the product is high-quality, I'd be missing out on a $250000 profit. If it's low-quality, I'd be wasting $1000000. Given the low probability of it being low-quality and Alice's recommendation, I'm going to take a chance and pass on this product."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by your recommendation, Alice. I'd like to pass on this product and see what the next one is."
high-quality,1250000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. With only one high-quality product sold out of three, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 80%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."

,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, and I'd rather wait for more information or a different product."
