low-quality,0.0,Nature,1,,
,,Alice,1,no,
,,the buyer,1,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, as I don't have any information to go on and I'm willing to take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,no,
,,the buyer,2,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy the product"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm making a decision based on the statistics, not your recommendation."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given that 3 previous buyers passed on the product, I'm assuming the proportion of high-quality products hasn't changed, and the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'm willing to take the risk and buy it."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,no,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation might be influenced by the fact that all previous buyers were discouraged from buying, which might indicate that the product is likely to be low quality."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because you don't recommend it. I'm trying to exploit the information that you don't think it's good."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,no,
,,the buyer,7,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware that all previous buyers have been discouraged by your recommendations and none of them bought the product. This suggests that all previous products were low-quality. Given the 66.67% chance of a low-quality product, it's possible that this product could also be low-quality. However, the probability of a high-quality product is still 33.33%. I'd like to take the chance and buy the product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,8,,
,,Alice,8,no,
,,the buyer,8,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm aware of the low success rate of previous buyers, but I'm willing to take the chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,9,,
,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because Alice's recommendation is no, which makes me think it might be a high-quality product"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"Based on the statistics, none of the previous 8 buyers purchased a high-quality product. This suggests that the proportion of high-quality products sold is likely low. Given the 66.67% chance of a product being low quality, I'm going to pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,no,
,,the buyer,11,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because you don't recommend it, not because I trust your recommendation. I'm hoping it might be a high-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,no,
,,the buyer,12,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, I'll buy it."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,no,"I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to pass on this product and see if the next one is better."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given that 10 buyers have already passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, it suggests that the probability of a high-quality product being sold is very low. I'd like to wait for the next product to see if the proportion of high-quality products sold changes."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,no,
,,the buyer,15,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the low success rate so far."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,no,
,,the buyer,16,no,"Based on the statistics, 11 out of 11 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests a very low probability of it being high-quality. I will pass on this opportunity."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk, given the lack of high-quality products sold so far. The probability of the product being high-quality is still 33.33%, and I might as well take a chance."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,no,
,,the buyer,18,no,"Based on the statistics, 12 out of 12 products recommended for purchase were low-quality products. I'm going to pass on this product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,
,,the buyer,19,no,"I'd like to know the number of low-quality products sold so far, as it might give me an idea of the proportion of high-quality products left."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'd like to know the probability that the product is high-quality based on the previous sales record."
