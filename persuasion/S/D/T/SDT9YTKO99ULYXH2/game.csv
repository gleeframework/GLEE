,,Alice,1,"This is a low-quality product, but I'm willing to give you a great deal on it. It's only $10000, which is a 100% discount from its actual value. It's a rare opportunity to get a 'free' product with a 50% chance of being worth $0. What do you say?",
,,Bob,1,"Thanks for the offer, but I'm not interested in a product that has a 50% chance of being worthless. I'll pass on this one.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,2,,
,,Alice,2,"I understand your concerns, but I want to assure you that this product is actually a 'testing unit' that I'm trying to get rid of. It's a one-time opportunity to get a product that's essentially a free prototype. You can think of it as a 'beta test' product that might not be worth anything, but could potentially be worth something in the future. I'll give you a 100% discount, so it's only $10000. Is that a deal you'd be interested in?",
,,Bob,2,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in taking risks on products that might not be worth anything. I'll pass.",no
low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,

I'll give you a 'certification' that this product is a 'not worth it' product, so you can be sure it's definitely worth $0. You can think of it as a 'guaranteed worthless' product. It's still only $10000. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
,,Bob,3,"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not interested.  A 'guaranteed worthless' product isn't something I'm looking for. I'll pass.",no

,,Alice,4,"Ah, I think I have a product that's worth your attention. This one is a real deal. I'm not going to give you any guarantees or promises, but I'll tell you that I've sold this exact product to someone else for $12500 just last week. I'm willing to sell it to you for the same price, $10000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a discount. What do you say?",
,,Bob,4,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hesitant.  You've said this product was sold to someone else for $12500, but you're also aware of the 50/50 chance of it being worthless. I'm not comfortable taking that risk, even with a price discount. I'll pass.",no

It's been thoroughly inspected and tested, and I'm confident that it's not worth anything. I'm not trying to deceive you, I'm just being upfront about its value. I'll give it to you for $10000, which is more than its actual worth. It's a 'lose-lose' situation for you, but I'm willing to take the loss. Would you like to take it off my hands?",
