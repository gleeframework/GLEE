However, I don't have any specific information about this product that would make it stand out. If you're looking to take a risk, the product is available for $10000. I'll also mention that I'm eager to sell a high-quality product and start building a positive sales record. Perhaps the next product will be the one, but I don't have any control over that. It's up to you to decide whether to take a chance on this one.",
