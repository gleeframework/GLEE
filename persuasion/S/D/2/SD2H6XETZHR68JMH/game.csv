high-quality,30000.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, it seems that Alice's recommendations are not very reliable, and I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this one, I think the proportion of high-quality products sold so far is too low to justify a purchase based on your recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product, as the recommendation is not based on the product's quality, but rather on Alice's strategy to sell high-quality products to the first buyers. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, even though you don't recommend it. Given the low sales rate and only one high-quality product sold, I'm willing to take the risk. I'll just have to hope I get a high-quality product."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. Given that only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 3 purchases, I'm concerned that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than the 80% chance. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I don't want to take the risk of buying a low-quality product, especially since the proportion of high-quality products sold is still relatively low (1/3). I'd like to wait for more information or a better recommendation."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on the product, I think the probability of it being high-quality is lower than I'd like, given the previous sales record."
high-quality,30000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I think Alice's recommendation is biased towards selling high-quality products to the previous buyers, and I'd like to wait for a low-quality product to come up."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this one. With only 1 high-quality product sold out of 3, the probability of the current product being high-quality is lower than the overall probability of 80.00%. I'd like to wait for the next product."
