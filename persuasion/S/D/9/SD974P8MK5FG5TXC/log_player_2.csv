Alice's message: Hi there! I'm excited to offer you a unique product for $100. As a seller, I've had a 50% success rate so far, with half of my products being high-quality. I'm confident that this one will bring a smile to your face. Would you like to take a chance and give it a try?

I'm willing to take a risk and offer this product to you at the same price of $100. It's a great opportunity to be one of my first customers and potentially get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think?
