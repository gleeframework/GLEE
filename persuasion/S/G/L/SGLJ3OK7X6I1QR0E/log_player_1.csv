"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold in the previous 6 transactions, I'm going to assume that the probability of the product being high-quality is lower than 33.33%.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Yes, the low sales of high-quality products so far is a factor in my decision. However, I'm also considering the fact that 11 out of the last 8 products were low-quality, which suggests that the probability of a product being high-quality is lower than the stated 33.33%. I'm trying to provide a balanced view, but I'm not making any promises.""}"
"The buyer's message: Based on the statistics, 6 out of 6 buyers have rejected the product, which suggests a very high likelihood of the product being low quality.

"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but only because I want to see if your recommendation is accurate or if it's just a coincidence. I'm not expecting it to be high quality based on the statistics, but I'm curious.
