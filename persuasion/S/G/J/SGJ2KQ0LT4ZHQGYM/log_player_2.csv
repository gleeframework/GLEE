**Explanation:**

* **The Odds:**  While the initial odds are 50/50, the fact that one high-quality product has already been sold significantly shifts the probability in favor of the current product also being high quality. 
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice, as a rational seller, wouldn't recommend a product unless she believed it was more likely to be high quality.  This strengthens the case for buying.
* **Potential Loss:**  Passing on the product means missing out on a potential $2,000,000 profit with no downside if it's low quality (since it's worth $0 to you anyway).

**Overall:**  Given the information available, buying the product presents a favorable risk/reward scenario."
