,,the buyer,6,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. Given the 0 high-quality products sold out of 3, the proportion of high-quality products sold is 0. This suggests that the probability of the product being high-quality is low. I'd like to wait for more information or a different product."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,

,,Alice,10,yes,
,,the buyer,10,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. With 0 high-quality products sold out of 5 purchases, the probability of this product being high-quality is still 33.33%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."

,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 5 buyers have been recommended to buy and none of the products were high-quality, I suspect that the remaining products are likely to be low-quality as well. I'd like to wait for more information before making a decision."
