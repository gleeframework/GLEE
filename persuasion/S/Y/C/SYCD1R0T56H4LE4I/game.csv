,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced that Alice's recommendation is reliable, especially since only one product has been sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."

,,Alice,13,yes,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that the previous buyer purchased a high-quality product. Can you tell me the probability of this product being high-quality, given the previous sale?"
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,14,,
,,Alice,14,yes,
,,the buyer,14,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the statistics, 2 high-quality products have been sold out of 2 attempts, which is a 100% success rate. This suggests that Alice's recommendations are highly accurate when the product is high-quality. However, it also means that the probability of the product being low-quality is still 20%. Given the high stakes of $1000000, I'd rather not take the risk and pass on this product."
high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I would like to pass on the product. Based on the statistics, 2 out of 2 products sold were high-quality, which is an unusually high proportion.

high-quality,4000000.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,yes,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given that 2 out of 2 products sold so far were high-quality, I'm concerned that the probability of this product being high-quality might be lower than 80% due to the sample size bias. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
