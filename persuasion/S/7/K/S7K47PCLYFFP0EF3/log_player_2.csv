"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to buy this product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The recommended product has a higher expected value than not buying:** 
    * The probability of a high-quality product is 80%, and the value of a high-quality product to you is $30,000. This means the expected value of buying is 0.8 * $30,000 = $24,000. 
    * Since the product costs $10,000, the expected profit is $24,000 - $10,000 = $14,000.
    * Not buying has an expected value of $0. 
* **Alice's recommendation is not necessarily a perfect signal, but it's still beneficial:** Even though Alice doesn't know the quality of each product, her recommendation is likely to be based on some kind of assessment, even if it's just a random guess. 

Therefore, in this round, it's more advantageous to buy the product and take advantage of the expected profit."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $30,000 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice! I'm happy to buy this product.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Similar logic to Round 1:** The expected value of buying remains the same: 80% chance of a $30,000 product, leading to an expected profit of $14,000.
* **Alice's recommendation is still valuable:** Even though she doesn't know the quality of each product, her recommendation could be influenced by some underlying pattern, even if it's just random.

Therefore, it's still more beneficial to buy the product and take advantage of the expected profit."

* **Consistent Expected Value:** The expected value of buying remains the same as in previous rounds. There's an 80% chance of a $30,000 product, leading to an expected profit of $14,000.
* **Alice's Recommendation is Likely Relevant:**  While Alice doesn't know the quality of each product, it's reasonable to assume her recommendations are not purely random.  Since she's recommended buying in the previous two rounds, and those products were high quality, it's reasonable to believe she might have some insight, even if it's subconscious.

Therefore, continuing to buy the product is still the most advantageous strategy."
