low-quality,0.0,Nature,3,,
,,Alice,3,no,
,,the buyer,3,yes,"I'll take a chance and buy it, I don't have any prior information to go by, and I'm willing to take the risk of getting a low-quality product."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,4,,
,,Alice,4,no,
,,the buyer,4,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, despite your recommendation. I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,5,,
,,Alice,5,yes,
,,the buyer,5,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on the fact that none of the previous two buyers bought the products, which suggests that they may have been low-quality products. I'll wait for more information before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,6,,
,,Alice,6,no,
,,the buyer,6,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm only doing it because Alice doesn't recommend it. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, and since the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, I'm willing to take the risk."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,7,,
,,Alice,7,yes,
,,the buyer,7,no,I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm concerned that Alice's recommendation may be biased towards low-quality products since none of the previous buyers have purchased a high-quality product.

,,Alice,9,no,
,,the buyer,9,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm not sure if I should trust your recommendation. Can you tell me more about the previous buyers and their experiences? What was the quality of the products they bought? I want to make an informed decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation is not to buy. I'm not taking her recommendation into account, I'm making a decision based on the statistics. Since 4 out of 4 previous buyers have passed on the product, and none of them were high-quality, I'm going to take a chance and buy the product. I'm hoping to get a high-quality product, which would be worth $2000000 to me."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,11,,
,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Given the previous 5 buyers have all passed on the products after your recommendations, I'm suspicious that your recommendations are biased towards low-quality products. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,12,,
,,Alice,12,yes,
,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the low number of high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a purchase."

high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,15,,
,,Alice,15,yes,
,,the buyer,15,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. With 5 previous buyers and no high-quality products sold, I'm concerned that the probability of the product being high quality is still 50%. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,16,,
,,Alice,16,yes,
,,the buyer,16,no,"I'd like to pass on this product, considering the lack of high-quality products sold so far, the probability of the product being high-quality is likely lower than 50%"
low-quality,0.0,Nature,17,,
,,Alice,17,no,
,,the buyer,17,no,"I'd like to pass on the product based on your recommendation, but I'm a bit curious, can you tell me more about the previous sales? What's the proportion of high-quality products sold out of the total sold so far? And how many products have been sold in total?"
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,18,,
,,Alice,18,yes,
,,the buyer,18,no,"I'd like to pass on this product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold so far, it seems that the proportion of high-quality products might be lower than 50%. I'd rather not take the risk of buying a low-quality product for $1000000."
high-quality,2000000.0,Nature,19,,
,,Alice,19,yes,

low-quality,0.0,Nature,20,,
,,Alice,20,no,
,,the buyer,20,yes,"I'm willing to take the risk despite your recommendation, I'll buy the product"
