"Round 1
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation! I'll take it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While there's a 20% chance the product is low quality, the recommendation from Alice, who knows the quality, makes it more likely that the product is high quality. The potential gain ($12,000) outweighs the potential loss ($0) given Alice's recommendation."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is the most valuable information we have. Since she is not recommending this product, the odds are in favor of it being low-quality.
