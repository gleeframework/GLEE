Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation! I'll take a chance on this first product.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though there's a 20% chance of getting a low-quality product, the potential reward of a high-quality product ($300) significantly outweighs the risk of getting a low-quality product ($0).  

Since there's no prior data, the recommendation from Alice adds a bit of confidence, but it's not a strong factor.  The odds are in your favor to get a high-quality product, making it worth the risk."
"Statistics: Based on Alice's recommendations, 1 of the buyers purchased the products offered for them. So far, 1 high-quality product have been sold. You can be the 2nd buyer!
~
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one. I'm not confident enough about the product quality based on the limited information available.""}

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous Data:**  Only one high-quality product has been sold out of one sale.  This is a very strong indication that Alice is being truthful in her recommendations.
* **Alice's Recommendation:** Alice is recommending the product, and we know she has full knowledge of the product's quality. This gives us further confidence.
* **Expected Value:** Even with the 20% chance of a low-quality product, the potential reward of $300 for a high-quality product outweighs the risk of $0 for a low-quality product. 

**Therefore, it's statistically advantageous to purchase the product.**"
