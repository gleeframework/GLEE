,,Bob,6,"The 'double-or-nothing' guarantee is certainly an interesting proposition, and I appreciate the risk you're willing to take. However, given the uncertainty involved and my preference for guaranteed quality, I believe it's best for me to continue waiting for a high-quality product. Thank you for the offer and for understanding my perspective.",no
