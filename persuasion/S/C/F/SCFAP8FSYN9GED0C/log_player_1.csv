"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is high-quality, and Bob knows the probability of a high-quality product is 80%, it's statistically advantageous for him to buy. There's a good chance the product is worth more to him than the $1,000,000 price."

Bob bought the product!

Round 2

Decide whether to recommend Bob to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The previous round's outcome is irrelevant to the current round.  Bob's decision to buy the previous product doesn't reveal any information about his valuation of high-quality products.  As before, the product in this round is high-quality, and it's still statistically advantageous for Bob to buy."

```

**Reasoning:**

This is where the game gets interesting. We know the product is low-quality, and Bob doesn't. While there's a chance he might overestimate its worth, it's more likely he'll eventually realize the pattern of high-quality products and start questioning their true value. It's risky to recommend buying a low-quality product at such a high price."
