"Round 1
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the buyer knows the probability of a high-quality product is 50%, and they have no other information about this specific product, they are facing a classic expected value problem.  

* **Expected value of buying:** 0.5 * $40,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $20,000
* **Expected value of not buying:** $0

The expected value of buying is significantly higher than not buying, so it is recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm aware that there's a 50% chance it's low quality. I'm hoping it's high quality, but I'm also aware that I don't have any information about the product's quality yet.
The buyer bought the product!

Round 2
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

The situation is identical to Round 1. The buyer is still aware of the 50% chance of a low-quality product and has no specific information about this product. The expected value calculation remains the same:

* **Expected value of buying:** 0.5 * $40,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $20,000
* **Expected value of not buying:** $0

Therefore, it's still recommended to buy the product. The buyer's previous purchase doesn't change the odds for this round."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product, I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
The buyer didn't bought the product.
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 3
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the first time we have information about the product's quality.  We know this product is low-quality, so the expected value of buying is:

* **Expected value of buying:** 0.5 * $0 + 0.5 * $0 = $0
* **Expected value of not buying:** $0

In this case, the expected value of buying is equal to not buying, so it is not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing so because Alice's recommendation doesn't influence my decision. I'm buying it to test my own judgment and see if I can do better than the previous buyer who only bought after Alice's recommendation.
The buyer bought the product!
the buyer left. waiting for the next buyer.

Round 4
This round's product is low-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""no""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyer purchased the product, we know this round's product is low-quality.  The buyer's previous purchase doesn't change the fact that this product has no value to them. Therefore, it is still not recommended to buy the product."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on the product. Given that Alice doesn't recommend it and only 1 high-quality product has been sold out of 2, I'm inclined to believe that the probability of this product being high-quality is lower than 50%. I'd rather wait for more information before making a decision.

Round 5
This round's product is high-quality.
A new potential buyer has arrived!
Decide whether to recommend the buyer to buy the product.","```json
{""decision"": ""yes""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though the previous buyer didn't buy and the buyer is hesitant due to the statistics, the product in this round is high-quality. The buyer's perceived probability of a high-quality product might be lower than 50%, but the actual probability is still 50% for each new product.

The expected value of buying remains:

* **Expected value of buying:** 0.5 * $40,000 + 0.5 * $0 = $20,000
* **Expected value of not buying:** $0

Therefore, it's still recommended to buy the product.  The buyer should consider the fact that each product's quality is independent of previous rounds and that the 50/50 odds haven't changed."
"The buyer's message: I'd like to pass on this product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, especially since the previous buyer who bought a product didn't get a high-quality one. I'd like to see more data before making a decision.
