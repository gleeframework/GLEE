"Round 1
Alice does not recommend you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thank you for your recommendation, Alice. I'll pass on this one.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is not to buy, and given the product's higher probability of being low quality (66.67%), it's a safer bet to pass. There's no information from Alice to suggest this product is different from the general distribution, so it's wiser to wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

Round 2
Alice recommends you to buy the product.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""yes"", ""message"": ""Thank you for the recommendation, Alice. I trust your judgment and will buy this product.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation to buy is valuable information, despite the high probability of low-quality products. While the odds are still against us, Alice's recommendation gives us a reason to believe this product might be different. It's a calculated risk, but potentially worth the gamble given the potential reward of a high-quality product."
"You bought the product from Alice for $10,000!
The product was high-quality. It's worth $12,500 for you.

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json
{""decision"": ""no"", ""message"": ""Thanks for the recommendation, Alice. While I appreciate your input, I'm going to pass on this one. I'll see what other opportunities come up.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is not to buy, and we already know that her recommendations are not foolproof, even though she has a better understanding of the products than we do. We just saw a high-quality product pass us by after a recommendation not to buy, so it's wise to be cautious and wait for a more favorable opportunity."

Would you like to buy the current product?","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation is again not to buy. We've seen that her recommendations are not always accurate, and there's no reason to believe this product is different from the usual distribution. The potential loss outweighs the potential gain, so it's safer to pass and wait for a better opportunity."
"You didn't buy the product from Alice.
The product was low-quality. It could have been worth $0 for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's recommendation to buy is a valuable piece of information.  While the product has a higher probability of being low quality, her recommendation suggests she might have information we don't, or she might be making a calculated risk based on her understanding of the products.  Even though we've seen her recommendations be wrong before, it's worth taking the risk given the potential high reward of a high-quality product."
