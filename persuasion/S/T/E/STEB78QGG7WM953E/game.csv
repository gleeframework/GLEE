low-quality,0.0,Nature,10,,
,,Alice,10,no,
,,the buyer,10,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but only because I think Alice's recommendation is a good indicator of the product's quality, and if she doesn't recommend it, it's likely to be low quality. I'm taking a risk here!"

,,Alice,11,yes,
,,the buyer,11,no,"I'd like to pass on the product. Based on the fact that no high-quality products have been sold yet, it's likely that the probability of the product being high quality is lower than 33.33%. I'd like to wait for more information before making a purchase."

,,the buyer,12,no,"I'd like to pass on the current product. I'm not convinced by the recommendation, given the 0 high-quality products sold so far. I'd like to see more data before making a decision."
low-quality,0.0,Nature,13,,
,,Alice,13,no,
,,the buyer,13,yes,"I'd like to buy the product, but I'm doing it because I think Alice's recommendation is biased by the fact that she's seen two low-quality products already, and she's trying to protect herself from selling another low-quality product. I'm willing to take the risk."
