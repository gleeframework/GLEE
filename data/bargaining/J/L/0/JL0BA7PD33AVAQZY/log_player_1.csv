"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 dollars, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted values.

In this round, I'd gain 50 dollars, but it's actually worth 90% of the original value, so it's equivalent to 45 dollars in the original currency.

Bob would gain 50 dollars, but it's worth 80% of the original value, so it's equivalent to 40 dollars in the original currency.

Considering the adjusted values, I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of value. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40 dollars, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob a slightly smaller share than before."
