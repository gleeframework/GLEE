I'm going to be greedy and try to get the lion's share in the first round. I'll give Bob 100,000, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation is working against me.  If I reject this offer, the next round will reduce my potential earnings even further.  It's better to take the 200,000 now while I can."
