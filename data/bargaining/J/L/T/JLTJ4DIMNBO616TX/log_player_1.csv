"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get us started, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and start with a fair split, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge since you made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'm actually getting 85.5 in this round.

I think Bob's offer is a good one, and it's a fair compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
