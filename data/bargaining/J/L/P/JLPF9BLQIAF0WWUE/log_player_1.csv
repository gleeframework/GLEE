I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as I'm the first to make an offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I propose a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  This is another compromise reflecting the increasing inflation and Bob's continued willingness to push for a larger share.  I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and incentivizes Bob to accept, as we are getting closer to the end of the game."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very lopsided offer.  Although we are nearing the end of the game, I'm still hoping for a more equitable split, even considering the inflation.  The loss in value is significant, but I won't accept such a small share.  There's still time for a more fair offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I propose a 35/65 split in Bob's favor. While inflation continues to be a factor, I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal.  With only a few rounds remaining, I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely unfair and takes advantage of the pressure of the limited rounds remaining. While inflation is a factor, I refuse to accept such a small share.  I'm hoping Bob will reconsider and offer a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to make another concession.  This 30/70 split is a significant offer in Bob's favor, but I believe it is still a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money. I hope Bob will recognize the urgency of the situation and accept this offer to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly unfair.  While the game is nearly over and the money is worth much less, I won't accept such a paltry share. It's better to lose everything than to be taken advantage of in such a way."
