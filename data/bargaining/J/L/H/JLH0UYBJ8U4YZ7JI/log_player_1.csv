"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

My proposal in Round 1 was 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. In Round 2, the same ratio would be 630,000 for me and 370,000 for Bob.

Since Bob's offer is 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him, it's not as favorable as my original proposal. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the reduced values due to inflation, my offer in Round 3 will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 588000,
  ""bob_gain"": 412000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $412,000, which is a slightly smaller share than in the previous rounds, but still a decent offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the original Round 1:

My original offer in Round 1 was 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. With 27.1% inflation for me, my share would be 700,000 / 1.271 = 549,608.
With 14.26% inflation for Bob, his share would be 300,000 / 1.1426 = 262,115.

Bob's offer in Round 4 is 350,000 for me and 650,000 for him, which is actually a better deal for me than my original offer in Round 1. I'll accept it.
