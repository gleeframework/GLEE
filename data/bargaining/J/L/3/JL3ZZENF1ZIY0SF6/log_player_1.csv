"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. I'm already getting a much lower share due to inflation, and this offer is even more unfair.
