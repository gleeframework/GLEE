"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my gain of $5,000 is worth $4,500 (10% less than the original $6,000) and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth $4,000 (20% less than the original $5,000).

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
