"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the higher inflation rate I face. This ensures we both get a significant share while accounting for the value depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
