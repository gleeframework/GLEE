"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Since the money doesn't lose value for Bob, he might be inclined to wait, but I'm hoping the offer is enticing enough for him to accept, considering the fairness of the split and the risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects us differently. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, accepting 40% of the original amount in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value due to the 20% decrease in value for me. I'm hoping to negotiate a better split that accounts for the inflation affecting my side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle to account for the loss in value on my end""}\n\nIn this round, I'll propose a 50/50 split, taking into account the inflation that affects my share. Meeting in the middle seems like a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money for me, while for Bob, the value remains constant. This offer aims to balance our interests and conclude the game fairly."
