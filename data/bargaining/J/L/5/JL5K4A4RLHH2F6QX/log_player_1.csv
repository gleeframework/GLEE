"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a division of $90 for myself and $10 for Bob. I'm starting with a generous offer, but I want to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very unfavorable to me.  I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain to 80, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  I hope this shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a fair share.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Even though the inflation is affecting my earnings more than his, I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm again lowering my proposed gain, but increasing Bob's. I'm hoping to find a compromise, but I still need to secure a good amount for myself before inflation eats away at my earnings too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not favorable, and the inflation is starting to hit me hard. I need to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  This might be my last chance to get a decent share, so I'm hoping Bob will see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation, Bob's offer is the best I've gotten so far.  It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all, especially with only a few rounds left."
