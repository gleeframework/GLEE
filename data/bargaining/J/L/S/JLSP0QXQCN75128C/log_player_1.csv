"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the value of the money is decreasing. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly skewed split, giving me a bit more to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is becoming less valuable. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the offer and end the game, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly and this seems like a reasonable split."
