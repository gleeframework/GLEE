"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, but I'm being generous and offering Bob 10%. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe fairness is key. This equal split ensures both of us benefit equally from this opportunity. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob! He's trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if I want to split it down the middle.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob due to inflation, I'm actually getting a better deal than I would have in the first round. But I'm not sure if I want to give up the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted fairness, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a quarter, but I'm taking the majority.""
}
```

I'm still trying to get the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share than before. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
