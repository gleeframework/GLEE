"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
