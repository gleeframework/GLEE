# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer. His gain is too high, and I'm not willing to give up 60% of the total amount.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive!
