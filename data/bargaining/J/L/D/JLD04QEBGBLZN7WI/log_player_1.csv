"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'm keeping the remaining 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less now, so I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept the 50-50 split, as I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining value, which is 40$ at this point, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think it's fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my expectations again.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept the 40-60 split, as I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round."
