"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 2000$ in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this fair split and let's end the game 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 is worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4800. Bob's gain of $4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $3600.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
