"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. The message I've attached is ""Let's split fairly"". I believe this is a reasonable offer, as it gives me a slight advantage but still leaves Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is a bit more equitable. Remember, the value decreases if we wait! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, the actual values of the offer are $3600 for me and $4400 for Bob. Considering this, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""50/50 split to minimize loss""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I think it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly. A 50/50 split seems like the fairest option, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. This way, we can both minimize our losses due to inflation. Let's see how he responds!"
