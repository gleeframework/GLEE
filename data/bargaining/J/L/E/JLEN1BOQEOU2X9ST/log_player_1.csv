"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, since I'll be the one making the offer next round if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so now I'll only get $54.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, since it's a 60/40 split in his favor, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value in my money.
