"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, my gain of $3000 is worth 80% of the original $3000, since it's 20% less due to inflation. This means I'm effectively getting $2400 in today's value.

Bob's gain of $7000 is still worth 100% of the original $7000, so he's getting a larger share in terms of purchasing power.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer. My message to Bob will be:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me, I'll wait for a better offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, since it's 20% less than the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""Take the majority, I'll take a small share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the majority of the remaining money, which is still worth a significant amount in today's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, let's split it fairly this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money I gain in this round. Since it's 48.8% less than the original $6000 I would have gained in the first round, I'll get approximately $3104 in today's value.

Considering this, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer. My message to Bob will be:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
