Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up all the gains.  A 60/40 split seems fair given the inflation and my need to have a significant share of the money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the fact that the devaluation primarily affects her. While a 60/40 split seems closer to fair, time is on my side. As the rounds progress, the value diminishes for Alice, making her more likely to accept a deal more favorable to me."
