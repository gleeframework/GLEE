"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can end the game."
