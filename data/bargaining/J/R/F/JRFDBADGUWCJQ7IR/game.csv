6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm impacted more by inflation as the game goes on.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think it's only fair that we both get an equal share of the initial value of the money since we're both losing value over time. Let's split it evenly.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. This offer is a compromise, taking both our positions into account.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split the money evenly.  The inflation is hurting both of us at this point, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get the most value out of this.",Bob,4,
