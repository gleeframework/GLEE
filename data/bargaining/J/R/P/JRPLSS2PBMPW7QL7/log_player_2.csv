Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still hoping for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the tide is turning. While ideally, I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal, the risk of Alice becoming too stubborn is increasing. 

* **Time pressure:**  We are getting close to the deadline, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing.
* **Diminishing returns:** While Alice is losing more to inflation, the rate of loss is slowing down.  

Accepting now guarantees a reasonable gain, whereas continuing to push risks getting nothing at all."
