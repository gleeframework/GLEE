"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take $900,000 and leave $100,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $810,000, but I'm still hoping to get a good portion of the money.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation, and Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While the money I'm getting is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, it's still better than nothing, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
