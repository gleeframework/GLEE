# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I think this is the fairest way to divide the money, considering we both face losses with time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but I think we need to reach a solution sooner rather than later.  The longer we wait, the less value we both get. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about the declining value, he's still getting the better end of the deal.  I need to push for a larger share before the inflation eats too much into the potential gains."
