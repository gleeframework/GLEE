"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split, but still hoping to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money I gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still want to maximize my share.
