I'm starting with a very generous offer. I figure it's best to try and secure a good deal early on, before the inflation really kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's an improvement for me, it's still not as good as my initial proposal.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick to a similar strategy as before, but I'm going to reduce my offer slightly.  With the inflation, it's in my best interest to secure a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting quite bad.  Inflation is really hurting me, but I'm still going to try and hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get at least a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my offer again to try and find a compromise. Bob is clearly wanting a bigger share, and I need to accept that inflation is hurting me. This offer still gives me a decent amount, even with the reduced value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very tough offer. Inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm going to reject this.  There are still a few rounds left and I'm hoping Bob will realize that I'm not going to accept such a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise again.  Inflation is really hurting me now, but I think a 60/40 split is the most I can realistically offer while still getting something decent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. The inflation has hit hard, and I'm really starting to feel the pressure.  This offer is still not ideal, but I think it's the best I'm going to get at this point.  I'm accepting, hoping to at least get something for my efforts."
