"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point?""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still offer Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and balanced start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 5000$ I would gain in this round is only worth 80% of the 8000$ I would have gained in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the money in this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You didn't get the deal last round, now it's my turn to make a strong offer""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 4000$ I would gain in this round is worth only about 50% of the 8000$ I would have gained in the first round, and even less than the 6000$ I offered in the third round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a bit better than my previous offer. However, I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 2500$ I would gain in this round is worth less than 30% of the 8000$ I would have gained in the first round. This offer is a significant concession from Bob, and I'm not sure if I should push for more.

However, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I think I should accept this offer to get some money now rather than risking waiting for a potentially better offer that may not materialize.
