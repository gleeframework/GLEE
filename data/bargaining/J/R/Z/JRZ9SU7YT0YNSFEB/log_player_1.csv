"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering I have the advantage in terms of inflation.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous proposal, and while the money is worth less for me now, it's still worth more to me than his offer. I'm not satisfied with this and want to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my share slightly to try and secure a deal.  I believe this offer is still favorable for me considering the inflation rate, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a good opportunity for him as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, this is the closest Bob has come to my initial proposal. I think it's best to accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
