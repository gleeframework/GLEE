"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and we can work from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to split the money 60/40 in my favor.  Let's get this done quickly so we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain would be worth even less than I initially thought.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer is now:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like a slightly more even split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,400 and leaving $3,600 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's better than getting nothing.  We're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less now, I'm starting to feel the pressure.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good idea to split the money evenly, especially since we're running out of time. I'd rather have $5,000 now than risk getting nothing.
