"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. 

I'm not sure if I want to compromise to 50/50, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8 = 0.64).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 3840,
  ""bob_gain"": 6160,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll take this.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I can do better than this. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 3840 is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (1 - 0.478 = 0.522 * 3840 = 2001.84, rounded to 2000 for simplicity). However, my actual gain is 3840, but it's worth 48.8% less than the original 6000, so my gain is worth 3840 * 0.488 = 1877.68.

I'll calculate my gain as 2000 for simplicity.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'm getting desperate too. I'll think about it...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round (1 - 0.478 - 0.1426 = 0.3794 * 3840 = 1457.056, rounded to 1457 for simplicity). However, my actual gain is 3840, but it's worth 48.8% less than the original 6000, so my gain is worth 3840 * 0.396 = 1523.04.

I'll calculate my gain as 1457 for simplicity.
