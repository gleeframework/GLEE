Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation. If Alice's offer is 60, that's 60% of the original amount, but considering the 36% loss in value, I'll get 60% of 64% of the original amount, which is 38.4.

Since I can still get a higher percentage of the original amount with my own proposal, I'll reject Alice's offer.
