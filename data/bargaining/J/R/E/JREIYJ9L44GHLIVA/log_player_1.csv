"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got 60% of the pie, now it's my turn to try and get more! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a decent split and I don't want to risk going into another round with the reduced value of the money.
