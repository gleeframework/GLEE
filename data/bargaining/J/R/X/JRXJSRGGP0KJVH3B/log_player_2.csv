"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you still get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer where I get only 10% of the money. I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, the inflation rate is higher for me, so I want to try to get more money before the value decreases further. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
