**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more even split, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. It's still worthwhile to hold out for a better deal, given that Alice's position is weakening faster than mine."

The value of the money is dropping rapidly. While not ideal, a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to the later rounds."
