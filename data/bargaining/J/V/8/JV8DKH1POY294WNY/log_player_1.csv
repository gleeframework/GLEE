"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair at this point in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to consider the decreased value of the money. Since the offer is still a 50/50 split, but with a slight skew towards Bob, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation adjustment, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself to account for the erosion of purchasing power.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
