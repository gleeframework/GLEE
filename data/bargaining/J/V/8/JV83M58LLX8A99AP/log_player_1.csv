"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a little more generous than my previous offer, and with the inflation, I'm not sure how much more I can push for. I'll accept, it's better than getting nothing."
