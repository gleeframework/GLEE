"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as we can adjust as needed in the following rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 4500 is a decent starting point, I believe I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice is willing to do to avoid the next round, where I'll be in the driver's seat."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll both face.  Let's get this done in the second round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money evenly. With the ongoing inflation, I think it's the most reasonable solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd still prefer a 60/40 split, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome given the inflation factor and the risk of further negotiation."
