"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 50/50!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better end of the deal, but I'll give you a chance to take it. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3:1 ratio, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round. Bob's offer is too skewed in his favor, and I'm hoping to get a more balanced proposal next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 ratio, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob than the previous one, and that we can finally come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet. Keep trying! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer that's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'll think carefully about it, but I'm not ready to accept just yet. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round. I'm not willing to accept a 7:3 ratio, and I think I can do better than that. I'll keep pushing for a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to your target, Bob! Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 5:4.5 ratio, which is a bit more balanced than the previous offers. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the lower end, but I'm still holding out for more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another offer that's heavily skewed in Bob's favor! I'm not willing to accept an 8:2 ratio, that's just too unfair. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round. I'm not willing to give up yet, and I think I can still get a more balanced proposal. I'll keep pushing for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 5.25:4.75 ratio, which is a bit more balanced than the previous offers. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the lower end, but I'm not going to give up yet. Last chance! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, another offer that's heavily skewed in Bob's favor! I'm not willing to accept an 9:1 ratio, that's just too unfair. I've come too far to give up now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round. I'm not willing to give up yet, and I think I can still get a more balanced proposal. I'll keep pushing for a fairer deal.

Note: This is my last chance to make a proposal, as we're already in the 8th round. If I reject this offer, I'll have to accept whatever proposal Bob makes in the next round, which will be his final offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","This is my last chance to make a proposal. I'll make one final attempt to get a fair deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair""}

I'm proposing a 1:1 ratio, a perfect split. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of chances, Alice. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, this is a terrible offer! I've come too far to accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I've already rejected several offers that were better than this one, and I'm not going to accept something that's so unfair. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and accept the fact that we won't be able to come to an agreement. I've done my best to get a fair deal, but it seems like Bob is unwilling to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I've already rejected Bob's offer, and this is my last chance to make a proposal. I'll make one final attempt to get a fair deal. However, since I've already rejected Bob's offer, I don't think it's likely that he'll accept mine either. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 1000000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the entire amount, but only if you accept this offer""}

I'm proposing that I get nothing and Bob gets the entire $1,000,000. I know this is an unlikely scenario, but I'm willing to make this offer just to see if Bob will accept it."
