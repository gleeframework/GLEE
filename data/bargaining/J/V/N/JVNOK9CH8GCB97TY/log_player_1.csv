"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor, knowing that Bob will likely reject it. This sets up a situation where he's motivated to accept a more even split in the future to avoid losing even more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation dynamic. If I reject, the next round will likely see Bob take a larger share, and the inflation will hurt me more than it hurts him. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and it's the best option in this situation."
