"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 40% less than the original $10,000, I'll make a new offer:
