"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion of the money. Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to secure a large share for myself in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. 

* **Inflation:** My share is worth less, making it even more important to secure something.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is significantly better for him, it's still a substantial gain for me, considering the inflation factor. 
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer means I risk getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds, especially with the inflation continuing.

It's better to take what's on the table now and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
