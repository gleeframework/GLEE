"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. I think it's fair, and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain would be 0.95 x 450,000 = 427,500.

I don't think this offer is fair, as I'm getting a smaller share than before, and the split is not as favorable to me as it was in my original offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again due to inflation, my gain would be 0.95 x 427,500 = 404,625.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still need a significant portion to make this worthwhile. Let's agree on this and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, my gain would be 0.854 (1 - 0.145) x 427,500 = 364,775.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'm getting a smaller share than before, and the split is still not as favorable to me as it was in my original offer. I'll reject this offer.
