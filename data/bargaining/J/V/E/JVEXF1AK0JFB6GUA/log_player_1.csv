I'm going for a very slight advantage.  I'm curious to see if Bob is greedy or if he'll go for a fair split right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not the most ideal, given the inflation, I'll end up with more than I would if I rejected and had to deal with another round of inflation."
