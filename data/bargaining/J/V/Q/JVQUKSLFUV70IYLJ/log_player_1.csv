I'll start by offering a large portion to myself, hoping Bob will accept and we can get this over with quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially since I know he's losing value on his side. Let's see if he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a bit more this time to see if we can reach an agreement. It's in my best interest to end this game as quickly as possible before inflation eats away at my share even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn. Even though his money is worth less now, he's still offering me a paltry sum. I'm going to stick to my guns and hope he'll realize that we're both losing out with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion. Hopefully, Bob will realize that if we keep going, we'll both end up with very little. This is a compromise, but I'm not willing to accept anything less than a decent share."
