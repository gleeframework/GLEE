I'm going to offer Bob $1, and keep $999,999 for myself.  While this seems unfair, I'm taking advantage of the inflation factor.  Since the money is worth 20% less to me with each round, I need to secure as much as possible now.  I figure Bob might accept a small amount since he gets to keep the same value regardless of the round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to keep more, it's better to take the $600,000 now than risk getting nothing at all. The inflation rate is significant, and each round means a substantial loss."
