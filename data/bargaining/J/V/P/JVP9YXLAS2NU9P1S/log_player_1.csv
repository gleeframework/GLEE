"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm not leaving you with too little, but I'm not giving up too much either."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll give you a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $950,000 (1,000,000 - 5% = 950,000). If we split it equally, I would get $475,000, but Bob's offer is offering me $500,000.

I'll accept this offer.
