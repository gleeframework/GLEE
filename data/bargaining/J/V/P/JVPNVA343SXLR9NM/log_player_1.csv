"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting with the same amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with the 3:2 ratio in Bob's proposal. I think I should get a bit more considering the initial offer was 4:1. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more equal split""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a 55:45 split. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial proposal was quite lopsided."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to equal, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 50:50 split, but I'm even less happy with the fact that Bob is getting a slightly larger share than me. I think I should get a bit more considering the initial offer was 4:1 and the compromise was 55:45. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations""}

I'm willing to accept a 50:50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the initial offer was 4:1 and we've been negotiating for a while. I think this is a good chance to end the negotiations and split the money evenly."
