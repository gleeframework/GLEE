# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a good offer for me. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 40-60 is not what I had in mind. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

I think Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the current market conditions and the fact that I rejected his previous offers. 45-55 is a relatively close split, and I'm willing to accept it."
