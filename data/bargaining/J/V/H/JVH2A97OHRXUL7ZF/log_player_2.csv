"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair, knowing about the inflation means I can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm taking advantage of the inflation. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not afraid to negotiate too. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is a win for me. The inflation has lowered my potential gains, and Alice's offer is more than what I proposed in the previous round. It's a good compromise."
