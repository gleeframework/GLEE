Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob, but this offer is still unacceptable. It's round 5 of 12, and I'm betting I can get Alice to offer at least a 50/50 split, especially as the rounds progress and the money becomes worth even less to her."
