Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, it's equivalent to $800,000. I'll make a counter-offer to try to get a better deal.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, the $600,000 I'd gain is equivalent to $384,000 in the first round's value. Still a decent offer, but I can do better.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 56% less for me now (36% less than the previous round, plus an additional 20% from the previous round), it's equivalent to $400,000. I'll make a new offer.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The math is getting tricky! Since the money is worth 59.04% less for me now, the $450,000 I'd gain is equivalent to $200,000 in the first round's value. That's a relatively small amount, but I'm running out of time. I'll think carefully...

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 76.48% less for me now (59.04% less than the previous round, plus an additional 17.44% from the previous round). It's getting really tough. I'll try to make a last-ditch effort to get a decent share.
