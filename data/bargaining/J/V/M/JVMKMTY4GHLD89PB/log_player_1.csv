"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get a majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less each round, I'll try to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good starting point. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
