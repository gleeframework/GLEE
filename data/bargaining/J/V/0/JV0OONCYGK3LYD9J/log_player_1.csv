"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}
