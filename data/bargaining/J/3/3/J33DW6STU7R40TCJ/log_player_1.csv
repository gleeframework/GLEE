"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
Bob gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'll reject this offer, since I can do better than that.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less in the fourth round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 45 * 0.727 = 32.705
Bob gain: 55 * 0.727 = 39.995

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable split considering the decreasing value of money.
