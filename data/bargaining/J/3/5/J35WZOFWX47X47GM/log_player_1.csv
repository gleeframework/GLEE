"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a fair division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems... interesting. I'll have to think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With my gain worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, I'm getting desperate.

Bob's offer is still 60/40 in his favor, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...
