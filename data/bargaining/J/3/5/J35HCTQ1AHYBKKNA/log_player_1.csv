Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a fair split given the current inflation. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is working heavily in my favor. He's clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. I'm willing to bet he'll offer me a much larger share in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, last chance. Take this deal and avoid further losses, or we both walk away with nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He's bluffed twice now with ""final offers,"" and his patience must be wearing thin. This offer is still heavily in my favor, but it gives him a sizable amount that he might be tempted to take before the value drops even further."
