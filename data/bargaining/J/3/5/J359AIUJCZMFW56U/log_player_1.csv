"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $5,250 (20% less than the original $6,500, which is 80% of $8,000).

I'm not sure if this is the best deal, but it's a fair split. I'll accept this offer.
