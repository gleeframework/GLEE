"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for the game and make it easier for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $8,000 in real value. However, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so he's only getting $2,700 in real value.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob, which is a more modest offer than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $8,000 in real value. However, Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, so he's getting $3,650 in real value.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 47.1% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leaving $5,500 for Bob, which is a more balanced offer considering the effects of inflation."
