"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. This is a fair starting point, and I think it's a good way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair, given that we both have equal say in this decision. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think a 51/49 split is too skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll make my next offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55/45""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the original 60/40 split, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division."
