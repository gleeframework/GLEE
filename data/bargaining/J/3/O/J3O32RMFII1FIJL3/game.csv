60.0,40.0,"Let's start fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor,  I'll take the bigger share since I'm the one making the first offer. Let me know what you think!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. You can't go lower than 30, or you'll be getting less than you proposed last round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm not happy with your last offer. Let's meet in the middle - 40 for me, 60 for you. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
20.0,80.0,"You're pushing for a 40/60 split? I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you the majority. This is my best offer so far.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
35.0,65.0,"Okay, I'm willing to budge a little more. How about 35 for me and 65 for you? This is my final offer. If you reject it, I'm sure you'll be losing out in the next round due to inflation.",Alice,5,
