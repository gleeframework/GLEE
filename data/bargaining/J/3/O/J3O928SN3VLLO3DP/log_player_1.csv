"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth only $45 in the previous round's value.

I accept Bob's offer.
