"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, you can have 55. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $45 is now worth 10% less than the $60 I proposed in the first round, so it's equivalent to $54.

As for Bob's offer, he's offering me $45, which is worth 5% less than the $40 he offered in the first round, so it's equivalent to $38.

Considering the offers, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
