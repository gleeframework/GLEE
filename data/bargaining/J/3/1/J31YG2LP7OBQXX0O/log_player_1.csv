"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. It's a fair starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me 600,000$ when I could potentially get more in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking a 5% bite, my offer needs to be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept a smaller amount to avoid giving me a larger share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think 550,000$ is a decent offer, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value."
