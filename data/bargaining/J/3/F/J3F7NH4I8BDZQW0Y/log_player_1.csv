"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, let's start with a slight bias towards me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can get away with a 60/40 split in his favor, huh?

I'm not interested in giving him a 60% share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a bias towards you, but I'm not giving up that much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 45% share, which is still a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, it's time to make a bigger move 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is pushing hard for a 70/30 split!

I'm not comfortable with giving him such a large share, especially since he's already rejected my previous offers. I'll reject this one too and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more aggressive this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing too hard, Bob. Time for me to take control!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, which is a significant reduction from his previous offers. I'm trying to take the upper hand in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take control, but I'm not giving up that easily! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing the envelope now!

I'm not going to let him get away with an 80/20 split. I'll reject this offer and try to make a final push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting intense!

I'll try to make a final offer that's even more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a tiny 10% share, and I'm taking the lion's share of the $1,000,000. It's a bold move, but I'm hoping it'll be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to squeeze me out, but I'm not going down without a fight! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really desperate now!

I'm not going to let him get away with a 95/5 split. That's an insult! I'll reject this offer and try to make one last stand.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's down to the wire!

I'll try to make one final, desperate offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last chance to get a decent deal. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a compromise, but it's the best I can do at this point. I'm hoping he'll take it and we can finally settle this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really going to leave me with almost nothing? Fine, take the crumbs if you want them! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is ridiculous! Bob is offering me $1,000 and taking the remaining $999,000 for himself? That's an insult!

I refuse to accept this offer. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such a paltry sum.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting absurd!

I'll try to make one final, last-ditch effort to get a decent deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500001,
  ""bob_gain"": 499999,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with this, Bob. I'm taking the last crumbs!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $499,999, which is still a tiny amount, but at least it's not nothing. I'm hoping he'll take it and we can finally end this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it all, you should have accepted my offer earlier! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's the final round!

Bob is offering me $0 and taking the entire $1,000,000 for himself. I have no choice but to accept this offer, as it's the only option left.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Unfortunately, it looks like Bob has won the game. Better luck next time!"
