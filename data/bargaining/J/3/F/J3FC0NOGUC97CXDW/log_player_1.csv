"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'll take the larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation if you'd like to reach a more balanced agreement in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4000 is now worth 3600 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 5700.

I'm not thrilled about giving up the larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
