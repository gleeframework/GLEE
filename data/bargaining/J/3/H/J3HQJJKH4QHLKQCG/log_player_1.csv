I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I get to make the first offer. Let's see how Bob feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not sure I can improve my position in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $4500, and with inflation, the next round might not be as favorable."
