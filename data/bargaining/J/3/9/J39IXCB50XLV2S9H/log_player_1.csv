"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous 30% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a little more, but don't think you're getting off that easy! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting desperate, but I do need to be strategic. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the continued inflation.

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, Bob. You're not getting it all!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more aggressive split, but still a reasonable proposal considering the inflation."
