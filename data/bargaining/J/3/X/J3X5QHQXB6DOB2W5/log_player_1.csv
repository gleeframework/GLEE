Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards him. I'd like a bit more of a share, considering the inflation factor.

# Alice gain: 4000

Considering the offers so far, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him. I'd like to get a slightly better deal, considering the inflation factor.
