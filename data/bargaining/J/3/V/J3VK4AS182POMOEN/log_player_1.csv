"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the inflation rate. Accepting this offer will at least give me something."
