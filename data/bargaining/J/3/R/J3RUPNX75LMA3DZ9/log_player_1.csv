"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a pretty generous offer, considering I don't know what Bob's strategy will be, and I want to maximize my gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, and I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's aggressive offer in Round 2. I'll try to balance my gain with a slightly higher value for Bob.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, my gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think I should take this offer to minimize my losses.

I'll accept this offer.
