"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you get $30. This seems fair to me considering the inflation we're facing.

# Alice gain: 70

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for you with every round!  I'll take $65, leaving you with $35. It's better to accept now than lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't helping anyone. My offer is still decent, but the clock is ticking and the value is dropping fast. Let's settle this now.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm giving you one last chance to make a reasonable deal.  $60 for me, $40 for you. Take it or leave it, because I'm not going lower. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is getting close to the wire, accepting would mean I get less than half the original amount, heavily impacted by inflation. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the ""last chance"" tactic. It's a gamble, but I think I can still get a slightly better deal in the next round or two before the inflation makes it truly awful for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer this drags on, the worse it gets for both of us, but especially for me due to the faster inflation rate. A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, is now the most logical choice to ensure we both walk away with something worthwhile."
