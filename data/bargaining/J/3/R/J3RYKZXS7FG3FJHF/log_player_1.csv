Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you $40, which is more than it will be worth next round. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is getting worse for you with every round!  I'll take $65, leaving you with $35. It's better to accept now than lose more to inflation.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth isn't helping anyone. My offer is still decent, but the clock is ticking and the value is dropping fast. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about the diminishing value, his offer is getting worse for us much faster than for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  He's clearly feeling the pressure, and it's likely he'll offer a bigger share in the next round to avoid losing even more."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best I'm likely to get at this point. The inflation is hitting Bob harder, but it's also significantly impacting my potential gains.  It's better to take a fair deal now than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
