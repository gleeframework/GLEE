"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly even split.  I think it's a good idea to be fair early on to build trust, and hopefully Bob will reciprocate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty unfair. I'll reject it and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this time.  Bob's last offer was too greedy, so I'm going to try to show him that I'm willing to be fair, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting even more greedy! I'll reject this offer too. I'm not going to accept such a small amount of money, especially with inflation eating away at its value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm going to try to be more flexible and offer a slightly higher share to Bob this time. Hopefully, this shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my own interests. We're both losing a lot of money with each round due to inflation, so finding a middle ground would be ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided. Even with the inflation, it's not worth accepting such a small share.  I'll keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share again, hoping to finally find a compromise.  This is a tough situation because the inflation is really hurting us both.  I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share if it means we can finally end this game."
