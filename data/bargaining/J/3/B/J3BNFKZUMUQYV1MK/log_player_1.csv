"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly larger share since I'm making the first offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 7,000 and Bob gets 3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a better deal if we play it smart. Let's split the money more evenly, with me taking a slightly larger share since I'm making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is good enough. I was hoping for a better split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split the money evenly, but I'll give you a slight edge since you're making the next offer.""}

I'm proposing that we split the money evenly, with each of us getting 5,000."
