I'm going for a high offer for myself in the first round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. Since we have many rounds to go, I'm willing to give him a small amount to get this started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating that Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm willing to accept his proposal. With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 10% less than the first round.  While a 70/30 split isn't ideal, it's better than losing all the money after 12 rounds."
