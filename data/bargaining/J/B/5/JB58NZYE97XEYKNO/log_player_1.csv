"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50-50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still gain $5,000 from this offer, which is the same as my initial gain in Round 1.

However, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, he's actually gaining $4,500 in real terms ($5,000 x 0.9).

I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage from the initial offer, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer a slightly biased split in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit desperate, aren't you?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, but I'll give you a slightly better offer 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of Bob's offer:

Bob's gain: $4,800
Real value: $4,800 x 0.7279 (1 - 0.2721) = $3,500

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll be getting $6,000.

This offer is better than the previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
