"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 70/30 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the reduced value of money. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the reduced value of money and trying to negotiate a better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40% of the remaining value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the rapid inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
