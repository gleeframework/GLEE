Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the best I can offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer we wait, the less the money is worth. Accepting now cuts our losses. 
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively better for us. There's a chance he might offer less in the next round.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in subsequent rounds, and the risk of further devaluation is significant.

It's a tough decision, but accepting a 60/40 split now is better than potentially getting a worse deal later due to inflation."
