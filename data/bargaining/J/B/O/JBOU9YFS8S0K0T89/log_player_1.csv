"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more equitable. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is equitable, considering the initial proposal was 60-40 in my favor. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think a 60-40 split in your favor is fair, considering my initial proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself."
