"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* Alice gain: 70 / 0.9 = 77.78
* Bob gain: 30 / 0.95 = 31.58

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer since I can do better in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get 75% of the current value of the $100, and Bob gets 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the reduced value of money:

* Alice gain: 72 / 0.713 (1 - 0.287) = 100.98 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 28 / 0.859 (1 - 0.141) = 32.53 (approximately)

Since the values are still relatively close, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer this time.
