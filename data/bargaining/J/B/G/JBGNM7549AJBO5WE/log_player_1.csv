"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept or if we'll need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll make it worth your while 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 95% of the original value, which is 285,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the previous round's value, which is 95% of 285,000 = 270,750.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm trying to balance the uneven split from Bob's previous offer, while still giving him a decent share."
