"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 8,000 in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%. My message to Bob is that if he accepts this offer, we can focus on splitting the remaining $8,000 in future rounds, rather than trying to negotiate the entire $10,000 at once."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly for now 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Splitting it evenly would leave us both with $5,000, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share this time, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself. My message to Bob is that he's getting a smaller share this time, but I'm willing to compromise to move the game forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less after each round! Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's offering me a slightly larger share, I think I can do better. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, trying to get closer to my target. My message to Bob is that I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still open to negotiations and willing to make some concessions."

# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's offering me a slightly larger share, I think I can do better. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out, but I'm not willing to settle for this offer yet. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. I'm making a strong offer.""
}
```

I'm making a strong offer, trying to get as close to my target as possible. My message to Bob is that this is my last chance, and I'm expecting him to accept. I'm willing to give him a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this deal."

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. At this point, I'm not sure if I can do better, and the money is worth so much less after inflation. I'm willing to accept this offer and take $5,200, even though it's not as much as I was hoping for earlier."
