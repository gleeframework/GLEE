"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems reasonable, and I hope we can agree on it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too one-sided, Alice. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, taking less doesn't make sense for me, and this gives you something now rather than risking less later.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. With inflation, we both lose if we keep rejecting offers. I propose a 50/50 split, a fair solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
