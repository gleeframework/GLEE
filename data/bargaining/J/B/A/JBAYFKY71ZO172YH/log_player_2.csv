"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. You'll still get a good amount, and we can avoid further rounds that would reduce the value of the money for you.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It accounts for the money's diminishing value over time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit less than before, but still a significant amount. Let's settle on a 57-43 split. Further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for you. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money for me in this situation! I'm offering a 52/48 split. Let's wrap this up and both walk away with a good deal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're eager to settle, but I believe I can still get a bit more. Considering the significant loss you're facing due to inflation, I'll offer a 58-42 split. It's more than fair, given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the value of waiting any longer is less than the potential gain from further negotiation. Accepting Alice's offer while I can still secure $420,000 is the most logical choice.
