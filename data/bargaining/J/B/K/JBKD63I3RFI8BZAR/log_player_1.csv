"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I can do better than that! I want more than 40""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message to hint that I'm looking for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more than 45%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. I'm framing it as a ""generous"" offer to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think you should give me a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if I should accept. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not sure if 45 is a good deal for me. I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 45 is enough, I'll think about it""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message to hint that I'm still not convinced."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $50 and Bob getting $50. I'm framing it as a fair and equal split to see how Bob reacts."
