Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share. Hopefully, he'll accept it, avoiding any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to secure some money now than risk getting nothing later with continued inflation."
