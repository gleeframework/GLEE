I'm going to try and be greedy in the beginning and see how Bob responds.  I'll keep a close eye on the inflation, though!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is going to drastically reduce the value of the money with each round.  This offer is a good split, and accepting means the game is over.  I'm taking it!"
