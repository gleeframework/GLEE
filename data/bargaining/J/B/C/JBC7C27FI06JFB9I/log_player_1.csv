"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
