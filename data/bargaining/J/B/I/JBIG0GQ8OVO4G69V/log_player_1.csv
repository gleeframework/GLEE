"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, given the inflation we're facing.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The 55-45 split is closer to a 50-50 split, which I think is more fair, especially considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gains more than mine. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This split takes into account the inflation and gives you a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 52-48 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
