"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal, hoping to get a quick deal.  I'll see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. While I'm losing money with each round, I'm also losing a smaller percentage of my share compared to Bob. I still have a chance to get a better deal, and I'm willing to risk it."

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
