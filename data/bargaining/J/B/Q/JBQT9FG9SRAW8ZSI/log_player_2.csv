"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for us both to secure a good deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Alice is taking a very large portion of the money. While it's a decent amount for Bob, it's worth waiting to see if Alice will offer something fairer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's a fair start, and we can both get a good amount before inflation takes its toll.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split to find a middle ground. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is a slight improvement, it's still heavily in Alice's favor. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's compromise. I'm willing to take a bit less than a 50/50 split to avoid losing more to inflation. This offer is a reasonable compromise, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway, but we need to finalize this before inflation significantly impacts both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too lopsided in her favor. The inflation is hurting her more than me at this point, so I'm hoping she'll come back with a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is as close to 50/50 as I'm willing to go, considering the inflation. We both need to secure a good share before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out due to inflation. I'm making a compromise - take it or leave it. We need to end this now. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is still not ideal, but inflation is severely impacting both of us now. It's time to end this and secure some gains before the value drops even further."
