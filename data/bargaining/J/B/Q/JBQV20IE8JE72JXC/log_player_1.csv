Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the money loses value faster for you. This gives you a decent share while still offering me a good portion. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
