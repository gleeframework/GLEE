"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with the reasoning that we should divide the money fairly, but I'll take a bit more since I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit greedy. Let's be reasonable, I need more than that to agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer since I think I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate affecting my gain is higher than Bob's.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again, and I'll make a new offer. I'll propose a division where I take $58 and Bob takes $42. My message to Bob is: ""I've considered your concerns, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle."""
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. It's a 50/50 split or nothing. The value is quickly disappearing for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I think accepting the 50/50 split is the best option at this point. The value is indeed quickly disappearing, and it's better to secure $50 now rather than risking further loss.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here and take the 50/50 split."
