"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, due to 20% inflation. I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money is worth 49.2% of what it was in the first round, due to 20% inflation over 4 rounds. I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4800 is worth 48% of the original $10,000, or $4800.
Bob's gain of $5200 is worth 52% of the original $10,000, or $5200.

This offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
