"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in the first round was $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob, but due to inflation, that's now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd be getting $5,700 and Bob would be getting $3,800.

Bob's offer in the second round is $5,000 for me and $5,000 for Bob, which is a 50-50 split. That's a better deal for me than my original offer, considering the inflation.

I accept this offer.
