"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a very generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution and avoiding the risk of inflation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal.  I'll reject this and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a significant advantage to Bob.  This should incentivize him to accept, as the inflation will continue to erode the value of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm willing to take a smaller share than in my previous offers, but his offer is not reflecting the value of the money for him due to inflation.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still leaving a sizable portion for Bob.  Inflation is increasing the pressure on him, and I'm hoping this offer will be more attractive than his previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's gains. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round, as Bob's share is diminishing with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm still offering a substantial portion to Bob. With inflation eroding the value of his share, I believe this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, inflation is hitting him hard, and I believe I can still get a more favorable deal in the next round.  I'm confident that I can secure a larger share before we run out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still offering a sizable portion to Bob. With inflation eroding the value of his share, I believe this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept. We are nearing the end of the game, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but inflation is heavily impacting his gains. I still believe I can secure a better deal in the next round. We are running out of time, but I'm confident I can get a larger share before we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm making a final push with a slightly reduced share, but still offering a substantial portion to Bob. We're in the penultimate round, and the risk of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real for both of us.  I believe the combination of a significant offer and the looming risk of getting nothing will finally persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the last round, and getting nothing is a real possibility now.  While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the significant inflation impact on his gains.  It's better to take a smaller share than risk losing everything."
