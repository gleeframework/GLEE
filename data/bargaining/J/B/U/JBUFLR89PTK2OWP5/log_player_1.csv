"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, I'll take a bit more than half, considering the inflation risk if we don't agree soon. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a bit more, but my offer is more reasonable in the long run. Let's be practical -  I'll take $55 and you take $45.  We need to settle this before inflation eats further into our shares."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both being stubborn, and inflation is taking its toll. I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's end this before the money becomes worthless. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses from inflation. Waiting longer risks even worse offers from Bob or reaching a point where the money is practically worthless. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting even less later."
