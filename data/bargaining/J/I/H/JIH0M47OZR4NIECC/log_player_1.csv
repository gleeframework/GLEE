"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a bit closer to even, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55/45 split. How about a 50/50 split? It's still a bit in your favor, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'm going to propose a slightly more aggressive split in my favor. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 52/48 is a more reasonable split. You can try to negotiate further if you'd like.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
