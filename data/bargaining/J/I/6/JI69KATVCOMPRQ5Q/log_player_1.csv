"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we both got a little more for ourselves.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In Round 2, the total amount is still $1,000,000, but it's worth less due to inflation. Let me calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 400,000 (as proposed by Bob) is worth 80% of its original value (due to 20% inflation), so it's actually 400,000 x 0.8 = $320,000
* Bob's gain: 600,000 (as proposed by Bob) is worth 90% of its original value (due to 10% inflation), so it's actually 600,000 x 0.9 = $540,000

Considering the adjusted values, I'm not happy with the 60/40 split in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation, so I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. But I still think I deserve a bigger share.""
}
```

In this proposal, I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original amount, and keeping $550,000 for myself, which is worth 55% of the original amount."
