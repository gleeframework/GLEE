"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have to make concessions to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I will reject this offer. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Additionally, the fact that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in this round gives me some leverage to potentially get a better offer in the future.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal.\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve more than half""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
