Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise between us."
