"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I get the larger share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small lead, but I'm willing to give you a chance to catch up! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an 80/20 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55/45. It's still a fair deal, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a more balanced approach this time, with a 55/45 split. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share, but I'm still willing to give you a small piece of the pie! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting even more aggressive!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 90/10 split, especially with the money being worth even less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. It's getting harder to make ends meet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! Let's split it 40/60.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money at this point and offer a 40/60 split. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
