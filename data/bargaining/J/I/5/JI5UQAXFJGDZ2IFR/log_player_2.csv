Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I still believe my initial assessment of a fair split was accurate.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I still feel that her offer doesn't quite meet me in the middle. Given that we're already losing value to inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Considering we're both trying to find a middle ground and inflation is taking its toll, I'm willing to slightly adjust my previous offer. This split is closer to equal and should be more acceptable to both of us.""}"
