```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split, especially with the money losing value due to inflation. It's time for me to make the next offer!"
