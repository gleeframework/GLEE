"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation that will affect your share more than mine. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced a 55/45 split is fair, considering I'll be affected more by inflation. I'd like to see a more generous offer.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer, and I'd like Bob to come up with a more generous proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,200 and leaving $5,800 for Bob, hoping this proposal will be more acceptable to him."
