"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I'll give you 60/40, a slight adjustment! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's 60/40 offer, and I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob! I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to give up too much.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a 58/42 split, but still trying to maintain a decent chunk for myself."
