"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 3:2, it's a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 3:2 is a fair start, especially since I'm losing more value due to inflation. I'd like to propose something else."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal, taking into account the 20% inflation that affects my gain:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll offer 48% to me and 52% to you. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal, especially considering the significant reduction in my share due to inflation. I'd like to propose something else."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal, taking into account the increased inflation that affects my gain:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 144000,
  ""bob_gain"": 856000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I need something closer to 15%. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the accelerating inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway."
