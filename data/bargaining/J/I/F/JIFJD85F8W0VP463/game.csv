600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40%. This way we both benefit from dividing the money now before inflation eats into it.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think 55% for me and 45% for you is a fairer split, considering the money's value will drop significantly if we don't settle soon.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split we discussed last round, but I need to take the lead on this deal. Accepting this offer ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation diminishes its value further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation, I believe a 58-42 split in my favor is reasonable. The sooner we agree, the more value we preserve.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the more we both lose. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now. It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with a substantial amount.",Alice,5,
