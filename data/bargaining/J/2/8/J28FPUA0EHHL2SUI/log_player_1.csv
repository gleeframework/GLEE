"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 70 and you get 30. Let's end it here and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

This offer is a 70-30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40 is a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less now, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is 60-40, I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60 is enough for me. I'll make a counteroffer: 50 for me, 50 for you. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself while still keeping the game going."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55 is the minimum I'm comfortable with. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive now, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping for a fair split. 50-50 seems reasonable to me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original, I need to adjust my thinking. A 50-50 split is actually a pretty good offer, considering the decreasing value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you've worn me down. 50-50 it is. Let's end the game and split the remaining $100.""
}
```

I think this is a fair deal, considering the circumstances. I'm willing to accept the offer and wrap up the game."
