# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount I'd get.

The offer is:

* Alice gain: $300,000 (which is 80% of $375,000, the original amount)
* Bob gain: $700,000

I think this is a very skewed offer in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject it.
