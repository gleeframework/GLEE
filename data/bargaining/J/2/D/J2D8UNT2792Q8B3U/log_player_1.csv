I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, even accounting for the inflation. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than my first, hoping to find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer again. This time, I'll be willing to take a bigger hit to my potential earnings to try and get an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, and with inflation taking its toll, I think it's time to accept.  We both get a fair share, even though it's less than we started with."
