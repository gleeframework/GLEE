"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

As the first proposer, I want to maximize my gain. However, I need to consider that Bob may reject this offer and we'll go into another round. In the next round, Bob will be the proposer and might offer me a very small share. 

Therefore, I'm offering Bob a small portion (100,000) to incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering me a much smaller share (100,000) compared to the 900,000 I was offering him in the first round. Even with inflation, this offer is significantly worse for me. 

By rejecting, I can become the proposer in the next round and have a chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

In round 2, I rejected Bob's offer, which was significantly worse than my initial proposal. This means Bob is likely willing to accept a smaller share to avoid another round of negotiation. I'm reducing my share by 100,000, but still maintaining a comfortable 80% of the total money. This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a fair outcome."
