"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want more for myself! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively getting 400,000 dollars in today's value. However, I have to consider that the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

This means that Bob is getting 600,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 600,000 / 0.95 = 631,579 dollars in today's value.

Considering this, I think I can do better than 400,000 dollars. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, let's see what you do!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm getting greedy now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting greedy!

Let's calculate the effective value of the money Bob gains. Since it's worth 14.26% less than in the first round, we need to divide 700,000 by 0.8587 (1 - 0.1426) to get the equivalent value in today's money.

700,000 / 0.8587 ≈ 814,511 dollars

So, Bob is effectively getting 814,511 dollars in today's value, while I'm getting 300,000 dollars. This is a pretty lopsided offer, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob is getting greedy, I'll try to take a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob! I'm taking a bigger share this time.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to push for more!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's really digging in his heels!

Let's calculate the effective value of the money Bob gains. Since it's worth 22.62% less than in the first round, we need to divide 800,000 by 0.7778 (1 - 0.2262) to get the equivalent value in today's money.

800,000 / 0.7778 ≈ 1,030,155 dollars

So, Bob is effectively getting 1,030,155 dollars in today's value, while I'm getting 200,000 dollars. This is a very lopsided offer, and I think I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a final push for a better deal. Since Bob is being stubborn, I'll try to offer him a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but don't expect any more!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept this offer!"
