"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can split it more evenly later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer because Alice is taking the majority of the money, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Plus, with inflation affecting Alice's share, the value of her proposed amount will decrease over time, giving me more bargaining power. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
