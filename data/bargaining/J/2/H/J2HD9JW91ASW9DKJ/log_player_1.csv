"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my first offer. I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to let Bob have a small portion. I figure he might accept it, especially since there are still 11 rounds to go and the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still a decent amount. It's better than getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
