"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 3000$ is now worth 2400$ (since 3000 * 0.8 = 2400).

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 45-55""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small piece, but I'm still hoping for more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, my gain of 2000$ is now worth 1040$ (since 2000 * 0.5202 = 1040).

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still a bit too skewed in his favor, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not eager to give up more than 10% of the total amount, so I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a tie, 50-50 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I think a 50-50 split is a fair compromise."
