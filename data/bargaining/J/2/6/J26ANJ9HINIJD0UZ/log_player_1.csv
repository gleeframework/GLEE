"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the initial amount. This way, we can both get a decent share and have a chance to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is now worth $90,000 (10% less than $100,000).

I don't think this is a fair split, considering the initial offer I made was already a generous one. I'd like to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a more aggressive proposal this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're starting low, I'm meeting you in the middle... sort of.""
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a significant share of the money, but I'm giving Bob a decent amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet. Keep trying! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 in the previous round is now worth $437,400 (27.1% less than $600,000). Considering this, the offer from Bob seems reasonable.

However, I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 in the previous round is now worth $437,400. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close to the wire, let's make a deal!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I'm hoping this will be the one that sticks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down. You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 in the previous round is now worth $358,400 (40.95% less than $600,000). Considering this, the offer from Bob seems reasonable.

However, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 in the previous round is now worth $358,400. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's getting late, let's split it down the middle.""
}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle."
