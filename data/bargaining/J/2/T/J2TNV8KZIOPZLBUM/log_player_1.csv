"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a significant amount considering the money will be worth 20% less for him in the next round. I'll get $700,000, which is a good chunk of the total, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still getting a significant amount. Meeting me halfway is a reasonable proposal, and I don't want to risk losing more in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
