Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject the offer.  Although it's better than the first round, I'm not willing to settle for such a big loss so early in the game.  There's still a lot of time to negotiate a more equitable split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 70/30 this time.  We can keep getting closer to a fair deal with each round.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting the offer.  While I understand Bob wants a better deal, 4500 is significantly less than what I initially proposed, and we're still early in the game. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
