**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, but the rate of inflation is hurting me faster. While her offer is tempting, I need to hold out for a better split, even if it means accepting slightly less favorable terms in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer reflects the urgency of the situation, let's close the deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation rate is becoming a significant factor. While I'm aiming for a better split, I need to acknowledge that each round decreases the value of the final deal. This offer is a strong push towards a more favorable outcome while acknowledging the time constraint."
