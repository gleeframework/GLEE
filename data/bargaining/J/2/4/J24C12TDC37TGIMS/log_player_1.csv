"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will benefit me more in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is more equitable than my first one, it still feels too low. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the game and making my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but still want to secure a majority of the money.  This offer gives Bob a larger share than my initial proposal, and I'm hoping it's enough to entice him into accepting before inflation erodes his share further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly more generous, but it's still not enough for me. I believe I can secure a larger share by continuing the game and making my own counter-offer. With each round, inflation is impacting Bob's share more significantly, increasing my leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick with a higher share for myself, but reduce it slightly from the last round. Inflation is really starting to bite into Bob's potential earnings, so hopefully this will be enough to entice him to accept before it's too late for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With inflation rapidly decreasing the value of Bob's share, I'm willing to accept this offer.  While it's less than what I initially aimed for, securing a guaranteed share is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
