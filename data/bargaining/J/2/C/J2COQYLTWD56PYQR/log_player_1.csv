"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking on more risk. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to carefully consider this offer.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 40% of the total amount, but I'm willing to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but 40% is too steep.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more balanced proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account that the money is still worth the same for me, but 10% less for Bob. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means he's getting an even smaller share of the total amount. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'm willing to consider this offer, but I'm still not thrilled about giving up 60% of the total amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to accepting, but 60% is still too much for me. Can we try to find a better balance?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with another offer that's more to my liking!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 60/40 is the most I'm willing to compromise on.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
