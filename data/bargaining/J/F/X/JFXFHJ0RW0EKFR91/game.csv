2000.0,8000.0,"I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share. Consider this a generous offer!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose we equally split the money, receiving 5000$ each. This seems fair given the current situation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"I'll take most of the remaining value, but I'll give you a tiny share. It's still a better deal than the current market rate!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given the inflation, I propose a division where I receive 4000$ and you get 6000$. This maintains a reasonable balance considering the decreasing value of money with each passing round.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500.0,9500.0,"I'll take most of the remaining value, but I'll give you a token amount to keep you from walking away completely. Don't expect any more generosity!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Considering the inflation and the pattern of the previous offers, I propose a division where I receive 3000$ and you get 7000$. This maintains a fair distribution while reflecting the diminishing value of money.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200.0,9800.0,"I'll take most of the remaining value, but I'll give you a tiny fraction to keep you from walking away. You're getting desperate, aren't you?",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Given the inflation and the trend of previous offers, I propose a division where I receive 2000$ and you get 8000$. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the decreasing value of money.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
100.0,9900.0,"I'll take almost all of what's left, but I'll give you a token amount. You're running out of time, and I'm not getting any younger!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
1500.0,8500.0,"Considering the inflation and the pattern of the previous offers, I propose a division where I receive 1500$ and you get 8500$. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the decreasing value of money.",Alice,11,

10.0,9990.0,"I'll take almost all of what's left, and you'll get the scraps. It's now or never, Alice. Accept this offer, or we both walk away with nothing.",Bob,12,
