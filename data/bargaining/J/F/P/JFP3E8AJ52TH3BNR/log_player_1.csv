Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 for herself and give Bob $400,000, with a message suggesting this is a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, and then we can both get more in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice rejects Bob's offer. It's now her turn again. Remember, with each passing round, the money's value decreases further for both, but more significantly for Alice.

### Next, Alice will make her proposal for Round 3, considering the decreasing value of the money.
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle of our last offers""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, Alice adjusts her offer, suggesting taking $550,000 for herself and giving Bob $450,000, with a message proposing they meet in the middle of their last offers to find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the previous rounds and the impact of inflation, Alice makes a new proposal.
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle of our last offers""}\n\n###\n\nAlice's strategy here is to find a middle ground, hoping that the compromise will be appealing to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money for both parties."
