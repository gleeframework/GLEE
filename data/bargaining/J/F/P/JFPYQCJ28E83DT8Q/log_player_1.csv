"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still offers Bob a small amount, hoping to incentivize him to accept it early on and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer gives me more than the previous round, it's still a significant loss compared to my initial proposal. I will reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

In round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than round 2.  To counter Bob's aggressive offer, I'm offering him a larger share but still aiming for a significant portion for myself. This should hopefully push him to accept and avoid further rounds of potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a substantial amount due to inflation, I can't afford to risk further losses. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least 500,000, which is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
