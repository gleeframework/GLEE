"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was rejected, so I'm now facing a tougher negotiation in Round 2. Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, while Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 91.7% of the original amount.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than proceeding to the next round with further reduced values. I'll accept this offer.
