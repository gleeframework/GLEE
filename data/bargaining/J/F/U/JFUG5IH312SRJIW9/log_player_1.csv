"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $60, which I believe is a generous offer considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. The remaining $40 will go to Bob. I've attached the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey that this division is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering inflation affects us differently. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 10% less, I need to take that into account when evaluating Bob's offer. Given the adjusted value, I don't think a 40/60 split in Bob's favor is fair. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I need to consider the impact of inflation again, as the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Given this, I'll adjust my proposal to try and find a mutually acceptable division.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose to take $58, with the remaining $42 going to Bob. I've attached the message ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground"" to convey that I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me and trying to find a compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
