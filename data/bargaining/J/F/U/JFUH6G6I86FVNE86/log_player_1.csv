"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 75/25 split. This might seem a bit lopsided, but I believe it's fair considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fairer distribution considering the risk of inflation.  Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
