"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 75/25 split. This might seem a bit lopsided, but I believe it's fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's risky to accept such a lopsided split right away. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further, especially since the inflation risk is also affecting her.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
