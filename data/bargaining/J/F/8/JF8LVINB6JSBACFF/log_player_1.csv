# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases rapidly for both of us, but especially for me. It's in my best interest to settle this quickly.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Bob's offer in Round 2 was advantageous to him. By slightly flipping the numbers, I'm offering a deal that's better for me while still being somewhat appealing to him due to the time pressure.
* **Direct Communication:** My message aims to be clear and assertive without being overly aggressive."
