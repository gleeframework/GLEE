"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair starting point, and we can reevaluate our options in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky this time, but I'll take a bit more next round 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to make a more strategic decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to improve my share in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
