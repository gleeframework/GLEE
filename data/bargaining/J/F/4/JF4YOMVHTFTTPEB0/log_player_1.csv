"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering my efforts in the first round.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than the 45% I was initially offered. However, I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is entirely fair, given that I'm already losing value due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, considering the inflation factor.""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can conclude the game."
