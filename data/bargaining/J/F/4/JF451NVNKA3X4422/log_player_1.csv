"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split, considering I have to deal with a larger inflation rate. Let's get this over with quickly!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money, and your inflation is much worse than mine. This offer is more than generous considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is ""generous"" considering the circumstances, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a more balanced split.  We both lose with each passing round, so let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is fair considering the time pressure and your rapidly devaluing money. Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the time pressure is real, Bob's offer is still not fair enough. My money is worth much less than his, and I need a better split to make this worthwhile. I'm hoping he'll realize we both lose if we keep going like this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be rational, Bob.  We're both losing money with each round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this now, before it gets even worse for both of us.""}
