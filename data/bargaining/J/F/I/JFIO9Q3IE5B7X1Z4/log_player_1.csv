"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount is 100 dollars. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 50 dollars, but I don't want to give up too much. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you can do better than that, I'll give you a chance to improve your offer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and giving him a chance to come back with a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, and 40% less than in the second round, I need to be more aggressive with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but still a bit more than the 30 dollars I initially proposed. The message is a bit more assertive, trying to convey that I'm not going to give in easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'll still give you a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain is now significantly lower. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 60% share, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you've convinced me, I'll accept your offer""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finalize the division of the money."
