"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. You can't do better than that.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is now worth 36 (since 45 * 0.8 = 36), and Bob's gain of 55 is now worth 52.5 (since 55 * 0.95 = 52.5).

I'll have to think about it... 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 from the previous round is now worth 36, and Bob's gain of 55 is now worth 52.5. I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd give me a slightly better deal last round, so I'm giving you a fair 60-40 split this time.""
}"
