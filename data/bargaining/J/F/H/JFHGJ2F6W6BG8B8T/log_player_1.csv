Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, considering the inflation will hit you harder than me. This offer takes that into account while still giving you a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
