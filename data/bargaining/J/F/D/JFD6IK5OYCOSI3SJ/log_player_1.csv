"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a large portion while still offering Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer. The inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future rounds.  500,000 is a substantial amount, and it's worth taking it now."
