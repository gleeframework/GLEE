"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's divide the money more fairly. I'll take 40% and you get 60%. This is a more reasonable starting point, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
