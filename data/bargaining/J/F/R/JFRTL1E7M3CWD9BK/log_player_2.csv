"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a smaller share now, and we can both get more in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's proposal seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the potential for greater gains in future rounds. By rejecting, I can secure the right to propose in the next round, potentially leading to a more favorable split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical. I'm offering a fair split that accounts for our respective losses due to inflation. This is the best deal we can get in the early rounds, and it allows us to both walk away with a significant amount."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation we're facing. If we keep going, we'll both lose a lot more money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the constant inflation risk makes this offer increasingly attractive. A 50/50 split ensures a significant gain for both of us, and continuing to negotiate risks losing a substantial amount due to inflation."
