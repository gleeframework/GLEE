Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical. I'm offering a fair split that accounts for our respective losses due to inflation. This is the best deal we can get in the early rounds, and it allows us to both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
