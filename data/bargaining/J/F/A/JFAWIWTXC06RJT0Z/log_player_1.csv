"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take 90$ and let Bob have 10$.  This is a good starting point to see how Bob feels about the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  The inflation is a significant factor, and with 10 rounds left, the value of my potential gains will continue to shrink. It's better to secure half now than risk getting nothing."
