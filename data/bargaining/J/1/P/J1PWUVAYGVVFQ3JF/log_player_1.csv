"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with the reasoning that I'm taking a bit more to account for the inflation difference between us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, this is a slight improvement for you considering inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, Bob's offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for himself does represent a slight improvement from my perspective, given that my share's value decreases by 10% each round, and his by 5%. However, considering the significant difference in how inflation affects us, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I need to consider the impact of inflation on both our gains and try to find a balance that Bob might accept, given that he also loses value, albeit at a slower rate. Since Bob offered me $550,000 last round, which I rejected, I'll adjust my offer to make it slightly more appealing to him while still trying to maximize my gain.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping this offer of $580,000 for myself and $420,000 for Bob, combined with the acknowledgment of inflation's impact, might persuade him to accept, as it shows I'm willing to compromise."
