"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, 60-40!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a relatively fair offer, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob with each passing round, I want to incentivize Bob to accept the offer sooner rather than later. By giving him a decent share, I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting now rather than risking further devaluation. The message ""Let's split fairly, 60-40!"" aims to convey a sense of reasonableness and cooperation, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking more of the inflation risk.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation, I will calculate the actual worth of the money for both of us in this round. For me, the money is worth 5% less, so the offer of $4000 is actually worth $3800 (4000 * 0.95). For Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so his proposed gain of $6000 is actually worth $4800 (6000 * 0.80).\n\nGiven these adjusted values and considering we are only in Round 2, I believe there is still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome for myself. I will reject Bob's offer in the hopes of securing a better deal in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll reassess the situation considering the inflation. The money is worth even less for both of us now. To keep things straightforward and avoid significant losses due to inflation, I'll propose a slightly more favorable offer to Bob compared to my initial one, while still ensuring I get a larger share. This approach aims to find a middle ground that might appeal to Bob, given the increasing devaluation of the money for him.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nBy offering a 58-42 split, I'm showing flexibility and acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, hoping this gesture will encourage him to accept the offer before the money devalues further."
