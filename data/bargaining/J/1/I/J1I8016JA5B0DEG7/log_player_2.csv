"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you get 40. This is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I can try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering her a smaller share. I'm also trying to appear reasonable by explaining my thought process in the message. Let's see how Alice reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Inflation is hurting us both, so we should be fair to each other. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's message, the inflation is actually only hurting her, not me. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, so she might be willing to compromise more in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but 36% less to Alice, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering her an even smaller share. I'm also trying to justify this by pointing out the significant impact of inflation on her gains. Let's see how Alice reacts!"
