Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the fairest deal given our current circumstances. We can both walk away with a substantial amount even after inflation.  Let's just call it even. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is risky. Bob's offers might get worse, and the value of the money will continue to decrease. 
* **Current Offer:** A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the inflation working against Bob at a faster rate.

Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable amount of money, even after factoring in the inflation from the previous rounds."
