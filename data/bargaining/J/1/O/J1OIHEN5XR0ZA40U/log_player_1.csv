"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about getting only 20%, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
