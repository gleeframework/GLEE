"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80%), and Bob's gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% * 90%).

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer takes into account the increased inflation and tries to balance the gain between us."
