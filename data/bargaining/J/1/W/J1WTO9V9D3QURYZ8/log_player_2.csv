"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent amount of money, I believe I can do better. The inflation will likely eat away at Alice's gains more than mine, so she might be willing to give me a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Alice with each round, I think she might be willing to accept this offer to secure a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's not ideal, this is a decent offer. The inflation is starting to bite, and it's unlikely I can get a better deal. I'm accepting to avoid losing more money in the next round."
