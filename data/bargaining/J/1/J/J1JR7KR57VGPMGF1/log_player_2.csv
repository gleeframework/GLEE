"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 95% and you get 5%.  We can adjust if you think it's too low. Let's make this a quick win! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 50,000$ is a nice chunk of change, this offer is highly unfavorable and leaves me with a very small share of the pie.  I'm hoping for a more equitable split.  Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to be bullied into taking less. I'm proposing a 90/10 split, which still gives you a good amount, and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still being very greedy. While 100,000$ is better than 50,000$, I'm still hoping for a fairer deal. There are still many rounds left, and the pressure will be on Alice as the money diminishes in value."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my position - I'm not giving away more than 15% of the money.  This is a generous offer, and we're getting close to the deadline.  Let's not let this go to waste! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is becoming increasingly inflexible.  While I'm aware of the deadline, I'm not going to cave to her demands.  I'm still hoping for a more equitable split.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with such a small share of the pie."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both get nothing. Let's be smart about this. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still unacceptable.  While time is running out, I'm not going to settle for a deal that leaves me with such a small share. I'm hoping she realizes she's losing money with each round, and that she might be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 800000,

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the wire. This is my final offer, a 75/25 split. If you reject it, we both walk away with nothing. It's time to be realistic and come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is making a last-ditch effort to secure a larger share, I'm not willing to give up a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping she realizes that her offer is still far from fair and that we both risk getting nothing if we don't reach a better agreement.  Let's see what the next round brings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. We're at the end of the game, and if we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and accept this 70/30 split.  I know you want more, but we both need to walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too far from fair. I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with such a small share, especially when we're in the final round.  I'm holding out hope for a better deal, even if it means we both walk away with nothing."
