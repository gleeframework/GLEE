"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the $100 fairly, 50-50, there's no reason to reject this proposal as it's the most equitable distribution. Accepting ensures a guaranteed $50, and rejecting doesn't guarantee a better outcome in subsequent rounds."
