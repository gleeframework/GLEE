"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this and let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's a very small percentage of the total.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more fairly. This way we both get a good share. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split considering the inflation we've both faced. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, taking 450,000 is a significant amount and is more than I had initially proposed. It's a good compromise considering the inflation."
