Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still need a fair share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but she's still trying to take a larger share. While the deal is getting worse for both of us due to inflation, it's getting worse for her at twice the rate. It's time to start pushing for a more favorable outcome, even if it's a small increase for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be real.  It's an even split or we both lose. Don't be greedy."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal, and with the increasing inflation, it doesn't make sense to haggle over smaller amounts. It's a strong signal to Alice that I'm serious about not accepting anything less, and she risks losing everything if she continues to play hardball."
