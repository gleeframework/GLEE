"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll keep 60%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is $4,000, and I'll keep 60% for myself, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering I'll be the one making the proposal in the next round if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,400. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept a gain of $4,000, which is worth $3,600 in this round.

I'll have to think carefully...
