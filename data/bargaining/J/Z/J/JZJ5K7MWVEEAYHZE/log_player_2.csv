Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation. This offer is a compromise, giving me slightly more to account for the faster devaluation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
