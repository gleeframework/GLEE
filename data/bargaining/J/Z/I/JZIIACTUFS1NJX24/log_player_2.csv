"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 60/40 split is reasonable for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer.  Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. We both lose money with each round, so it's in our best interest to come to an agreement sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and the inflation is getting out of hand! Let's end this before we both lose more."
