"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm offering Bob $3,000, and I'll take the remaining $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully. My initial gain of $7,000 is now worth $5,600 (80% of $7,000), and Bob's offer of $4,000 is worth $5,400 (83.33% of $5,100).

I'll decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my offer will be:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering Bob $4,500, and I'll take the remaining $5,500."
