"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial offer would be less valuable now.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering I could try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and see what happens next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob suggested a 50/50 split last round, I'll try to take a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's see if you agree.""
}
