I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, and even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in favor.  I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still trying to be reasonable.  I believe this split is fairer than Bob's offer, and with the inflation factor, it's still a good outcome for both of us."
