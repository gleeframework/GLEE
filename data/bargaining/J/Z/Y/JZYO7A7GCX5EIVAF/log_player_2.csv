"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This is a terrible offer for Bob.  While it's tempting to take something, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Even if Alice's offer were fair, it would be better to reject and see what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is still lopsided, it's much better than the previous round. Considering the inflation, it's likely that any further negotiation will result in a worse outcome for Bob. Accepting this offer secures some gain, even if it's a small amount."
