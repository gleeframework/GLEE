"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer represents a fair split considering the decreasing value of money with each round. Please consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split, acknowledging the value decrease. This should be a good starting point for a fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a more balanced distribution. This maintains a fair share while acknowledging the diminishing value of money with each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent amount of money, given the inflation. Waiting for a more favorable offer risks losing even more money in the next rounds."
