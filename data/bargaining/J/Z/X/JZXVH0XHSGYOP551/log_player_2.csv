"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate if you think it's too unbalanced. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is too lopsided. Let's split it 60/40.  This is a fair reflection of the risk we're both taking. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. I need to push for a more significant gain in the next round or two."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This acknowledges your position while reflecting the increasing pressure from inflation on my end.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We're both losing value with each round, and we need to agree before things get worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While I could hold out for a slightly better split, Alice is unlikely to offer more at this stage. Accepting the 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable amount, even with the 18.55% inflation loss. Waiting any longer risks a worse offer and further losses to inflation."
