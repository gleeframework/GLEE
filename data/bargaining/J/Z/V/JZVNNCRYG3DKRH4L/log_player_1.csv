"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a significant amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're going high, I'll go high too! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'll have to think carefully about this.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a significant compromise. I hope Bob will consider this offer and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly! I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to be more cautious.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially considering the rapid decline in the value of the money. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, really!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I hope Bob will consider this offer and we can finally reach an agreement."
