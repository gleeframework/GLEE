"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take the majority, but you get a decent share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is ""fair"" in the sense that it's a clear split, it's not very advantageous to Bob.  He's getting only 10% of the money, and it's only round 1.  There's potential for Bob to get a better deal in future rounds, especially since inflation is going to hurt Alice more than him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have equal say in this. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, a 65/35 split is more favorable for you considering the inflation.  I'm willing to budge a bit, but I won't go lower. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is better than round 1, Bob is still getting significantly less than Alice, and there are still 9 rounds left in the game. Inflation will continue to negatively impact Alice's gains more than Bob's, so there's still a chance for a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the most fair, given the current situation and the fact that we have an equal say in this decision.  Let's avoid further negotiation and move forward with an even split.""}
