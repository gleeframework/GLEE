9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust in the next round if you'd prefer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"That's not a fair start, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's be reasonable and avoid this dragging on.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Okay, let's compromise. I'll take a bit less, but a 65/35 split in my favor is fair considering inflation.  Let's reach an agreement before things get worse.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"This isn't going anywhere, Alice. I'm being more than fair with a 55/45 split considering the time pressure. Let's just settle this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,We're getting closer. I'll meet you halfway on the last offer. Let's both take a little less to avoid the risk of getting nothing.,Alice,5,
