"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small amount now, but I'll take a huge hit in the next round, so you can make a better offer then. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is very unfair to Bob, giving him only 1% of the money. While it's true that Alice will take a bigger hit in the next round, it's worth risking to see if a fairer offer comes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We both get half now, and we can negotiate further if needed.""
