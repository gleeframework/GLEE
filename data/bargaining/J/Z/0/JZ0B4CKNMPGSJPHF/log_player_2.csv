Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, fine.  Let's split it 60/40.  But I'm not budging any further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice. This means every round that passes makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Time Pressure:** We only have 12 rounds, and waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing. 

Accepting 400,000 is better than gambling on a potentially better deal in later rounds and risking a 0 payout.
