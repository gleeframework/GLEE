"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give you $400,000 and take $600,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000 and taking $550,000 for myself. This is a slightly more skewed split in my favor, but I'm hoping you'll still accept."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money even further, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the split is now 50-50, I'll accept this offer.
