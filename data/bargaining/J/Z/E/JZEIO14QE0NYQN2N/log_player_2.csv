"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. Think about the long game. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not satisfied with 35% of the total amount. The decrease in money value due to inflation isn't a significant concern at this point. I'll take my chances in the next rounds to negotiate for a larger share. Let's proceed to Round 2. I'll make a counteroffer then."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  This is a serious offer, take it while you still have a chance to get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the first round, considering the inflation, I'm still not satisfied with 38% of the total amount. With 9 rounds left, I believe there's room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable division. I'll proceed to Round 4 and make another offer.\n\n###"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're leaving me no choice.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for both of us. Take this deal before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the previous ones, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (59.04% less for me), I still believe I can negotiate for a more favorable division. With 7 rounds left, I'll take the risk and proceed to Round 6 to make another offer. The pressure is increasing, but I'm not ready to settle yet.\n\n###"
