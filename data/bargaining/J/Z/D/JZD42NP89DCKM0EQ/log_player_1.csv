"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate is much lower for me than it is for you. Let's avoid further rounds and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
