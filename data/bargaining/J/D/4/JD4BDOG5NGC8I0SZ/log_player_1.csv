"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can wrap up!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, $50 is equivalent to $55 in the original amount. And since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, $50 is equivalent to $40 in the original amount.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value, but I'll consider it a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.
