"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. How about this?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** It's crucial to make a counter-offer quickly. Delaying benefits Alice more than Bob.
* **Fairness:**  While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it heavily favored her. A slightly more balanced offer is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Positioning:** Offering a little over half to Alice acknowledges her desire for a larger share while still securing a decent amount for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this offer. Take it before the money loses more value! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Tactics:** Alice is using psychological pressure by emphasizing inflation. While it's a factor, it doesn't mean Bob should accept a bad deal.
* **Trend:** Alice's offer is only slightly better than her first one, even though the value has decreased for both players. This suggests she might be hoping Bob will panic and accept anything out of fear of further inflation. 
* **Holding Strong:** By rejecting this offer, Bob signals he's serious about getting a fairer share and won't be pressured into a bad deal. It might make Alice more willing to negotiate significantly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. We both lose out if we wait any longer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Both players are losing money due to inflation.  It's time for a bold move to get a deal done.
* **Slight Advantage:**  Offering Alice slightly less than half puts pressure on her, as any further delay hurts her more in the long run.
* **Finality:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob shows he's serious and won't be drawn into further rounds of potentially unfavorable negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

This assumes Bob is willing to risk a tough negotiation. If Alice doesn't accept and he has to propose again in Round 5, he'll likely be forced to accept a less favorable deal due to the rapid inflation working against him."
