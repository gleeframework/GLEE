"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage but still seems fair to Bob. I want to see if he will accept it or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is slightly better for me than my previous offer, and it's not worth risking further negotiation."
