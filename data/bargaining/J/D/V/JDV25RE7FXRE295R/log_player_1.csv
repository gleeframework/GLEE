"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original $10,000.

My effective gain would be 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 (approximately), which is less than my original offer of 6000. Considering the reduced value of money, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
