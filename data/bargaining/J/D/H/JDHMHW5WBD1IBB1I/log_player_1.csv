"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole $100, but I'll let you have a chance to propose a better deal in the next round.""
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward offer - I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, but I'm giving Bob a chance to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair split is 90/10 in my favor.  It's a good start, and we can keep negotiating if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to think strategically.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 90/10 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 40/60 split, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risks of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair offer and accept it."
