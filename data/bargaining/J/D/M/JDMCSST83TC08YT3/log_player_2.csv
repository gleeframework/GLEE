Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 43

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Inflation is steadily eroding the value of Bob's potential gains. Every round makes waiting riskier.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows inflation is working in her favor. She's likely to keep offering slightly better deals for herself, hoping Bob cracks under the pressure.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between this offer and a potential offer in the next round is unlikely to outweigh the 5% inflation hit Bob will take.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts losses and ends the game."
