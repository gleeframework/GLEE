"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I get 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly higher share, but not too greedy, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll accept it:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
