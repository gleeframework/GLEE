Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, I believe this offer strikes a balance between our interests. It's slightly more favorable to me, reflecting the higher depreciation of the money's value to you if we proceed further. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200
