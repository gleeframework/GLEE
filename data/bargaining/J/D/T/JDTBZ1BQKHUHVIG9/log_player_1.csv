Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose that I take 90 dollars, and Bob takes 10 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it gives Bob a decent share considering the inflation rate in the game."

I'm lowering my share slightly to 85 dollars, but still offering Bob a decent 15 dollars. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aware of the inflation impacting Bob's share more."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
