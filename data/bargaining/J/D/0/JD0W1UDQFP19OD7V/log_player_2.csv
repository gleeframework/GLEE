"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation risk for you 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, considering the inflation risk, it's not in my best interest to accept it in the first round.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Even though the offer seems generous, the value of my share will decrease significantly in future rounds due to the 20% inflation. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  By rejecting, I get to make the proposal in the next round.  This gives me the opportunity to negotiate a better deal for myself, potentially securing a larger share of the money. 

It's better to play it safe and see if I can get a more advantageous deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical. I'm taking a bigger share due to the inflation risk.  This is a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The 36% inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains.  
* **Reduced Negotiating Power:** By rejecting the previous offer, I lost the opportunity to propose and potentially get a better deal.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation and the fact that I am in a weaker negotiating position now.  

It's best to accept this offer to secure some value, as the risk of further rounds and inflation could potentially lead to me getting nothing."
