"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $270,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth $630,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the 75-25 split, but I'm willing to accept a smaller share if it means getting something. I'll take it.
