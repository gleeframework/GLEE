"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the money, and Bob will still get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually quite generous. I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
