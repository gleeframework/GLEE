"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 and take 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to be too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* My share: $70 \* 0.95 = $66.50
* Bob's share: $30 \* 0.95 = $28.50

Not a bad offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was thinking more like 50-50. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55 and you can have 45.""
}
```"
