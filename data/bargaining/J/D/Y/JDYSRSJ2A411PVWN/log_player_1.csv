"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob $600,000 and keeping $400,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the value of the money will decrease over time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}"
