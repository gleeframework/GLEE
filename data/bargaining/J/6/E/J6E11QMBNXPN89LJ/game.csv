650000.0,350000.0,Let's split the money in a way that both of us can benefit. I propose we divide it 65:35.,Alice,1,

525000.0,475000.0,"Considering the inflation and previous offers, I suggest a 52.5:47.5 split. This balances our shares while accounting for the decreasing value of money with each round.",Alice,3,
