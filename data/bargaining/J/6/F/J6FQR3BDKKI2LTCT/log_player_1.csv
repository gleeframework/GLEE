"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split, let's see if you accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it evenly. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I would gain in this offer are:

* My gain: $4,000 * 0.95 (5% less due to inflation) = $3,800
* Bob's gain: $6,000 * 0.80 (20% less due to inflation) = $4,800

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal. So, I'll accept this offer.
