"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take $60 and Bob will take $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more equitable. How about we split it 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 10% less than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $36. However, I notice that Bob's gain of $60 is worth 5% less than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $57.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I would be getting less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
