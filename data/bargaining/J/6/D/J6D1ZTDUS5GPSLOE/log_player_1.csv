"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see how it goes!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but it's still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. In the first round, 50 dollars was a 50% share, but now that it's worth 5% less, 40 dollars is only about 44.7% of the original 50% share.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Bob taking a larger share, especially considering the value of the money has decreased for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see how Bob responds!"
