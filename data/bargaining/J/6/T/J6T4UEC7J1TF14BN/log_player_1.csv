"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 70-30 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's be pragmatic and split it this way. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I reject the offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The 70-30 split is not favorable to me, and I think I can negotiate a better split considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more than mine. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\n### Now it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. A 55-45 split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\n### Please relay this offer to Bob."
