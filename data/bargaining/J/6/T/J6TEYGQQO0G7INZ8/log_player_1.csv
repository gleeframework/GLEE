"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to take a slight loss now to avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my share later on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
