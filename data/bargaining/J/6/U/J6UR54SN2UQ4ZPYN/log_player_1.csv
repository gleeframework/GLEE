"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000, and I'll take $8,000. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000, which is 80% of the original $10,000, and gives Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll receive $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9) if I accept Bob's offer.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 81% of its original value, so I'll receive $8,100 (10,000 * 0.81) if I accept my own offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $3,000, and I'll take $7,000. It's a good deal for both of us.""
}
```

This offer gives me $7,000, which is 70% of the original $10,000, and gives Bob $3,000, which is 30% of the original $10,000."
