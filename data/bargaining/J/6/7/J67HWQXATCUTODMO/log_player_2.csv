"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the situation. While she's right that my potential gains are shrinking, she's not budging much at all. It's still better to hold out for a better offer, even with the increasing inflation.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a slight advantage to you, but this needs to settle now before inflation eats us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, think about it 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, but she's wrong to think I'll cave to pressure.  It's getting close to the point where the inflation will make even a slightly unfair deal better than nothing. However, I need to show some backbone here or she'll keep pushing for a worse deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 46, ""alice_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious. Take this deal. This isn't about fairness anymore, it's about salvaging something before we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is excruciating, but I have to be realistic.  We're down to the wire, and the inflation is eating away at my share with every passing round. If I reject this and Alice doesn't drastically change her tune in the next round or two, we'll both end up with nothing. This offer is far from ideal, but it's better to take something now than risk getting nothing at all."
