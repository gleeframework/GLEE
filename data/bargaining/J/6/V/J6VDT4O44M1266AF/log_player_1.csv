"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of 500,000 is now worth less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
