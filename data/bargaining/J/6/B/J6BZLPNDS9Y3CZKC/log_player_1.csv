"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering Bob will be receiving a larger discount on his share in the next round if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering an 85/15 split, still in my favor but acknowledging that Bob's share has significantly decreased due to inflation.  This should be more appealing to him than accepting another round of losing 20% of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too high for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a low share after another round of inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 75, which is still a significant gain for me.  However, Bob's share is also increasing, which should make it more appealing for him to accept. This is a compromise that acknowledges the impact of inflation while still offering a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm still not willing to accept such a low share. We're getting dangerously close to the end of the game, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm willing to drop my share down to 65, which is a substantial concession.  Bob's share is rising, and the pressure of time is mounting.  He needs to consider accepting this offer before the inflation hits him even harder."
