Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. This offer keeps things fair considering the inflation, and ensures we both benefit more than with further delays. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but she's still using the inflation difference to her advantage. While waiting is risky, I believe holding out for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds is worthwhile."
