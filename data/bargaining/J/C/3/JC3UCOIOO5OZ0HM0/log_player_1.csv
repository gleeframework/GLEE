"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly, or reject and I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. I'm keeping the rest, $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.9 = 495,000

I'll reject the offer and make a new one for the next round.

# Bob gain: 600000

Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.727 = 436,200
