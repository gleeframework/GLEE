Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let time run out! 
# Bob gain: 4400

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would still mean losing a significant portion of my potential gains due to inflation.  I need to push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The effects of inflation are becoming increasingly detrimental. While I'd prefer a slightly favorable split, proposing anything else at this point risks us both walking away with nothing. A 50/50 split ensures a reasonable outcome for both of us, and the firm ""take it or leave it"" language emphasizes the urgency."
