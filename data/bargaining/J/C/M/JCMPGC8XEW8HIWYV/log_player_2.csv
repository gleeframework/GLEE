"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we'll see how it goes. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000$ is a good start, it's worth holding out to see if Alice will offer more. The potential for inflation means that delaying could result in a better outcome for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I propose 550,000 for me and 450,000 for you. This way we both get a substantial amount and can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 450k.  Let's split it 525k/475k, and we can call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point. Inflation is starting to bite into my potential gains, and waiting longer could lead to a worse outcome. 525,000 is a significant amount, and it's likely that Alice is willing to compromise more than I am."
