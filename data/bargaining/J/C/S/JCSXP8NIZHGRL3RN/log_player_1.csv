"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering the value of the money will decrease over time. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 50/50 split to start? This seems like the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, a 50/50 split is not as attractive to me as it would have been initially. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

Since the value of the money decreases faster for me, I'll try to get a bit more than I initially offered, while still leaving a reasonable amount for Bob. Let's see if he accepts this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer heavily favors you considering the inflation. Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Although Bob thinks his offer favors me, I disagree. With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, 4500 is actually worth much less to me than it would have been initially. Considering this, I think I can still get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 5:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, need a better cut""
}


Since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I'll try to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss. I'm hoping Bob will understand the impact of inflation on my gain and accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a little. This offer is still generous to you considering the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}\n


At this point, the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly for me that I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds. Bob's offer is not ideal, but considering the impact of inflation, I think it's the best deal I can get. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
