**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and the deal gets worse for her due to inflation.  While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, we can likely push her further. We're getting close to the halfway point of the rounds, so we need to start being more aggressive but still offer something that seems reasonable on the surface."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000,

""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, take this deal before you regret it!""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, time is running out for Alice, and the inflation is eating into her potential gains. It's time to apply pressure and make her think this is her best chance.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 51/49 shows a tiny bit of movement on my part,  making it look like a concession and potentially making Alice more amenable.
* **A Sense of Urgency:** The message aims to create a sense of urgency, pushing Alice to accept before she ""misses out"" on this ""generous"" offer."
