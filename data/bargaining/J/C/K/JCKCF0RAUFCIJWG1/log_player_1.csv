"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, the offer is:

Alice's gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll accept this offer.
