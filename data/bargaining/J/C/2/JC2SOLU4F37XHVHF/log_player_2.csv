Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting an offer that leaves me with a measly $1000 out of a million. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."

This is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Alice $600,000, which is a significant amount, but I believe I deserve a substantial share as well. I'm hoping she'll see this as a reasonable compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Don't push your luck.

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is better than her initial one, I still think I can do better.

Let's split the difference.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping that Alice will see that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm still not giving up on getting a significant share of the money."
