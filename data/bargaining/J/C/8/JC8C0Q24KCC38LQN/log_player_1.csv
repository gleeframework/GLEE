"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give you a chance to improve on your first offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $3000 * 0.95 = $2850
* Bob gain: $7000 * 0.95 = $6650

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd like to get more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try again!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50-50 split, a fair and equal chance for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5000 * 0.8574 = $4281.00
* Bob gain: $5000 * 0.8574 = $4281.00

I'm tempted by the 50-50 split, but I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
