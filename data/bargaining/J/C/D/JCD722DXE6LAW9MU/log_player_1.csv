"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point""}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a decent amount considering we're just starting out. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both have an equal say in this. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, especially since I think I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet. I'll wait for my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 is a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and meet Bob halfway. Since we're both rejecting each other's offers, I'm hoping this 50-50 split will be more appealing to him."
