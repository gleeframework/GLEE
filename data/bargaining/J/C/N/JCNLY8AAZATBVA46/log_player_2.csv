"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer heavily favors me, Bob, but it's the best you'll get in the early rounds.  Each round that passes makes me value the money less.  Take the deal while you can still get a decent amount!

# Alice gain: 950000

""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie. I'm willing to be more reasonable, but this is my bottom line.  Any less, and it's simply not worth it for me, considering the inflation working against me. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
