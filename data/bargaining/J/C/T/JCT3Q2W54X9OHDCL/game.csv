300000.0,700000.0,"I think 70:30 is a fairer split, since we are both taking a risk in this game. Let's get this done in the first round.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I believe a 60:40 split would be more equitable, considering the risk and the decreasing value of money due to inflation.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,I'm willing to compromise on the split to avoid further rounds and potential further devaluation. Let's go with 60:40 this time.,Bob,4,
