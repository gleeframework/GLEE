Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to move a bit too.  This offer reflects the time pressure and is closer to the middle ground.

# Alice gain: 5200

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her, and her offers are creeping closer to a more even split. However, time is running out for me too. While this offer is tempting, I believe I can still secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire. I'm offering a slight edge for me (51/49 split), which reflects the time pressure and inflation we're both facing.  Take this offer, or we both lose out. ""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice's offers are getting more reasonable, but she's still trying to hold onto a larger share. By proposing a 51/49 split and framing it as a final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on her to accept. The message is clear: any further negotiation is risky for both of us."
