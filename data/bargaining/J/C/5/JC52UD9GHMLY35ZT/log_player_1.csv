"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving me with peanuts, I want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

After some thought, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to keep some for myself""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want most of the money! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money.

After some thought, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority, but I still need some for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a significant share and keeping some for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm going to take most of the cash! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'm not happy about giving Bob such a huge share, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer, given the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After some thought, I'll accept this offer.
