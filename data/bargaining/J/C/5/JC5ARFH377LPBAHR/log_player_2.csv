Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Your middle seems a bit skewed, let's try this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, inflation is killing me 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split now prevents further losses due to inflation for both of us."
