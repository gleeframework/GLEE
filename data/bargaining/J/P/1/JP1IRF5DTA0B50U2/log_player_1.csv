"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'll get $5000 now, but it will be worth 10% less in the next round. I think it's a good opportunity to secure a decent amount of money now.
