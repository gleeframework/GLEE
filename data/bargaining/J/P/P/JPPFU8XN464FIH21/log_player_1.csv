"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,500 in ""old money"".

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
