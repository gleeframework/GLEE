"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 is now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $5,000, which is worth $4,500 after inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
