"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($6000) and leave 40% ($4000) for Bob, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. This opening offer is a strategic starting point, aiming to negotiate from a higher position while still appearing reasonable, considering the looming threat of inflation that disproportionately affects Alice. The message ""Let's share fairly"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of equity, although the offer itself slightly favors Alice to account for the future devaluation of the money in her perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better split for me this time. It's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting this offer would mean that the $4500 I receive would be worth significantly less than its face value, making the deal less favorable. Since we are only in Round 2 and there are 10 more rounds to negotiate, I believe there's room to push for a better split that more evenly accounts for the depreciating value of the money from my perspective. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer that could potentially mitigate the effects of inflation on my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the 20% devaluation of the money from my perspective in the first round and the need to find a mutually agreeable split before the money loses further value. By proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself compared to the initial offer, I aim to compensate for the loss due to inflation while still presenting Bob with a reasonable share, hoping that the adjusted figures and the message will encourage Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm acknowledging the inflation impact. This offer gives you a larger share than the previous round, making it worthwhile despite the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer slightly increases my share compared to the previous round, the cumulative effect of inflation means that the $4800 offered is now worth nearly half as much as it would have been in the first round. Given that we are still relatively early in the negotiation process, I believe there's room to push for an even better offer that more adequately compensates for the significant loss in value from my perspective. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a proposal that could potentially offset the effects of inflation more effectively."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Counteracting inflation requires a more substantial adjustment.""}\n\nIn this round, considering the significant devaluation of the money from my perspective (a 48.8% decrease in value), I'm proposing a more aggressive split to try and recoup some of the lost value. By increasing my share to $6200, I'm attempting to offset the inflationary loss while still offering Bob a considerable amount. The message aims to justify this adjustment as necessary due to the economic conditions affecting my side of the negotiation, hoping to persuade Bob that this split is more balanced under the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this stage, given the severe impact of inflation on my potential gain (a 67.23% decrease in value), a 50/50 split seems more reasonable than continuing to negotiate for a marginally better deal. Each subsequent round will only further erode the value of the money from my perspective, making it increasingly difficult to achieve a more favorable outcome. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a tangible amount, albeit significantly reduced by inflation, rather than risking further devaluation or potentially ending the game without any gain if negotiations fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
