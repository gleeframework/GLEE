"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good chunk while I get a larger share to start. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a good offer for the first round, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  The inflation will hurt Alice more than it hurts me in the long run, so I'll try to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the idea of a split, but I need a bit more.  This offer still gives you a sizable amount and saves you from further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal, and the inflation is starting to bite.  Accepting this will ensure I get something, while the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other is too high."
