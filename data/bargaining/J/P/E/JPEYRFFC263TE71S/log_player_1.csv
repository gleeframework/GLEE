"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, as it seems we're back to a 50-50 split, which I don't think is a good compromise after my initial offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of $5,000, which is $4,500.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob seemed willing to compromise in the previous round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight edge. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the gap between our offers. I think I deserve more, considering the value of the money has decreased. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,500 is now worth 72.9% of $6,000, which is approximately $4,374.

Bob's offer is now a 45-55 split, which is closer to my previous offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him a larger share.

However, considering the value of the money has decreased, I'm willing to consider this offer. I'll accept it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
