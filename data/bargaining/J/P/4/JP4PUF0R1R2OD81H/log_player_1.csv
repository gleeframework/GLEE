"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm also trying to get a good chunk of the money for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to be careful.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% * 90% = 81%). I'll keep this in mind when making my next offer.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a decent share of the money, while still leaving room for negotiation."
