"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us a good share and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to try and get a better deal.  Even though Alice's offer is fair, I think I can do better by rejecting and seeing what she comes up with next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation will eat away at our money if we keep playing. Let's reach a deal before it's too late!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my offer is more than fair. Let's not be greedy and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is the same as the first round, but the inflation makes my gains much smaller. I'll accept this offer to avoid further risk."
