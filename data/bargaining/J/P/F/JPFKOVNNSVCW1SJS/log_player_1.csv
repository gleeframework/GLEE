Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me the majority share while still offering Bob something.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is quickly devaluing the money. This offer is a fair split, and accepting ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing."
