I'm offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll be tempted to accept quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the value of my portion will decrease in the next round due to inflation. I'm going to bet on myself being able to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly higher offer than before. It's a bit riskier, but with inflation affecting Bob more, I think it's worth a shot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. Even though the money Bob gains is worth significantly less now due to inflation, he's still getting a large portion. The risk of inflation is too high, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round. It's time to take what I can get."
