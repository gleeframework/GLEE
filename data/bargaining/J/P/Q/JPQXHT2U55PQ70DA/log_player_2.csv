"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split. I'm hoping we can reach a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, it's too far off from a true 50/50 split, and there are still many rounds to go.  I'll see if Alice is willing to be more fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
