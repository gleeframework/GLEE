"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, the total amount is now $80 (100$ * 0.8).

Bob's offer is to split the money equally, with each of us getting $50. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the current $80, which is $44, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $36. I'm trying to be more generous this time around!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the total amount is now $51.20 (100$ * 0.512).

Bob's offer is to give me 45% of the current amount, which is $23.04, and keep 55% for himself, which is $28.16. This is a bit more generous than his previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise.
