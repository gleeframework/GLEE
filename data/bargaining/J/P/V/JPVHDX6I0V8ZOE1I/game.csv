7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the inflation factor.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering the inflation factor and allows us both to gain something from the negotiation.,Bob,2,
