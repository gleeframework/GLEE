"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is a good one, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and risking even more inflation.
