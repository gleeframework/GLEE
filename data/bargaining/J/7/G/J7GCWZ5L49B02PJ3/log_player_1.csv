"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money is now worth less, and Bob's offer is a bit more skewed in his favor.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money is worth even less, and Bob's offer is a bit more balanced.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob is getting closer to a reasonable split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value."
