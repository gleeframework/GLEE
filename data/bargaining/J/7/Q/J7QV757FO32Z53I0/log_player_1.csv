"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start with a proposal that gives Bob a small share. This allows me to keep most of the money, while hopefully not making Bob feel too cheated and leading to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation makes accepting this offer a good idea. If I reject, Bob will make the next proposal and I'll get even less money."
