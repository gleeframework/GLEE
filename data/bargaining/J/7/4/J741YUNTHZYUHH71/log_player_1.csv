"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are worth 10% less, so I'm effectively getting $7,200 (80% of $9,000). Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he's effectively getting $3,800.

Considering the new proposal, I'd rather not accept it since I'm giving up more than I was in the first round, and I'm not sure what the future offers will look like. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount is $8,100 ($9,000 - 10% of $9,000).

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll! The effective amount is now $7,300 ($10,000 - 27.1% of $10,000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if it's the best deal. However, I'm also not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, and splitting it 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
