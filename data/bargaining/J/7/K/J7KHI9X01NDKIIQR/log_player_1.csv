"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small portion to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both start with a good base, and we can avoid the risk of losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with splitting the money evenly, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a slightly larger share. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to be fair, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation.

I'll accept his offer, but I'll keep in mind that I'm giving up the opportunity to negotiate for a larger share.
