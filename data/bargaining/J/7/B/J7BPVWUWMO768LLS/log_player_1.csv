"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving Bob with 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a bit better.  Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 49 dollars is actually worth 49 * 0.95 = 46.55 dollars.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a bit more, considering the initial offer was 60 dollars and I'm already losing 5% of the value. But I don't want to reject it outright, so I'll...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, my gain of 55 dollars (which I'll offer to Bob) is actually worth 55 * 0.95 = 52.25 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer was 60.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it closer to the middle again.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 48 dollars is actually worth 48 * 0.8574 = 41.16 dollars.

Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, I still think 41.16 dollars is a bit too low for my initial expectation of 60 dollars. But I don't want to reject it outright, so I'll...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the third round, my gain of 57 dollars (which I'll offer to Bob) is actually worth 57 * 0.8574 = 48.93 dollars.

Here's my new offer:
