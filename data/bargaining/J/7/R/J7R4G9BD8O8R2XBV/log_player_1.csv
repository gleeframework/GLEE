"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the total, and I'll take 60%. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting my willingness to negotiate. Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 4500 * 0.9 = 4050
Bob gain: 5500 * 0.9 = 4950

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
