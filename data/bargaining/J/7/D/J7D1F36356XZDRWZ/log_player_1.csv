"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
This way, I'll get 70% of the original $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob will get 30% of the original $1,000,000, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll get $200,000, which is 20% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get $800,000, which is 80% of the original $1,000,000.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000
}
```
This way, I'll get 85% of the original $1,000,000, which is $850,000, and Bob will get 15% of the original $1,000,000, which is $150,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll get $600,000, which is 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get $400,000, which is 40% of the original $1,000,000.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll try to get a larger share. However, Bob's offer is a relatively good one, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer.
