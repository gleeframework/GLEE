"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, especially since I was hoping to get a bit more in the first round. However, I also don't want to prolong the negotiations and risk losing more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's avoid further rounds and both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 55-45 split, especially since I was hoping to get a bit more in the previous rounds. However, I also don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll now! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more aggressive in my offer to make up for the lost value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $65 and Bob gets $35. This is a more aggressive split in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops even further due to inflation."
