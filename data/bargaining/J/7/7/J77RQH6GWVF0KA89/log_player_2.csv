Round 5

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  While her offer is slightly better than last time, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal, even if it means risking more inflation."
