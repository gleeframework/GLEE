"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the higher inflation rate you'll face. Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Although the offer might seem tempting at first glance, it's important to remember that Bob's inflation rate is significantly lower than mine. By rejecting this offer, I can highlight the difference in our positions and potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
