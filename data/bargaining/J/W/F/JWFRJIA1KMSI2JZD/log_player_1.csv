"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 4500/5500 split. It's a more equitable division, and while I'm taking the risk of inflation, I believe it's worth it for a fairer outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
