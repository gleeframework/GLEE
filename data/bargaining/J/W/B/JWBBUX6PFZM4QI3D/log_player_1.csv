I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, given that you proposed a 60-40 split in your favor last round. Let's be even! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give in to Bob's demand for a 60-40 split in his favor. I think a 50-50 split would be more reasonable.
