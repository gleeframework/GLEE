Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I know Bob's money is worth less in each round. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While the money is worth less now, I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm offering 80/20 this round, which should be more appealing to Bob considering his money is losing value at a faster rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While the value of my money is dropping, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the inflation, but I'm still going to try and hold out for a better deal.  I'm offering a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will see that his money is losing value at a much faster rate."
