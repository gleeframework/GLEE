"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a relatively even split that favors Alice slightly. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, avoiding the negative effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less favorable to me than my initial offer, accepting it avoids further inflation and ensures I still get a decent share of the money."
