"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less, so I'm looking at 6000 * 0.9 = 5400$.

Bob's offer is 5000 for me, which is less than my current offer, but I think I'll accept it since it's a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
