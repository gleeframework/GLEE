"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not satisfied with 40% of the money. The inflation rate is higher for me, so I want to try to get a better deal before the money loses too much value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split. I think this is more fair considering the inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not buying the ""final offer"" threat, especially since we're only in Round 3. The inflation is starting to take a toll, but I still think I can get a better deal. Alice's offer is actually worse than her initial one, considering the inflation. I'll take my chances and see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger share due to the higher inflation rate affecting me. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This is the same offer as round 1.  Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've been trying to get a better deal, but considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains (59.04% less than the initial value), I think it's time to accept this offer. It's the same as the initial offer, but due to inflation, the actual value is much lower. However, I don't think I can afford to wait any longer, as the value will only continue to decrease. I'll take the 4000, which is now worth much less than it was initially, but it's better than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
