  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""

Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous, huh?

I'll have to be careful now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I want to give Bob 600,000, especially since it's worth 20% less than what I would have gotten in the first round. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."

I'm not going to fall for it. Here's my response:
