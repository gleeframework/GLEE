"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better for both of us. We'll both lose value over time, so let's start with a fairer distribution. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is tempting because it seems fairer on the surface. However, it's crucial to remember the rapidly depreciating value. While a 60/40 split seems okay in a static scenario, Bob's share is losing value at twice the rate of mine. By the next round, his potential gain will have shrunk significantly, putting me in a stronger position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Your share loses value twice as fast as mine. I'm offering you a deal that makes sense considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a concession from my initial 70/30 offer, making it appear more reasonable. 
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:** My message emphasizes the rapid devaluation of Bob's potential gain, putting pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Aiming for Advantage:**  By round 4, the value difference will be even more significant, giving me more leverage. This offer aims to secure a favorable split while Bob still perceives it as somewhat fair."
