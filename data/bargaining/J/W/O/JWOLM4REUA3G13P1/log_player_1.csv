"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  It's highly unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets up a clear pattern for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
This is a fair and reasonable offer. It's in my best interest to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
