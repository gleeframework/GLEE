"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still get 60% of the initial amount. However, Bob's gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation, so he's essentially getting 54% of the initial amount.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer since I think I'm still getting the better deal. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now that Bob has made a proposal, I'll try to counter with a new offer. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than mine, I'll aim to get an even better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 45%. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the situation. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still get 60% of the initial amount. However, Bob's gain is now worth 27.1% less due to inflation, so he's essentially getting 43.3% of the initial amount.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer since I think I'm still getting the better deal. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob has made another proposal, I'll try to adjust my offer to take into account the increasing inflation. With each round, the money Bob gains is worth less and less, so I'll aim to get an even better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000
}
```

This way, I'll get 58% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 42%. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can end the game here."
