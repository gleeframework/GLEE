"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting,  I know that with each round, the money will be worth less to me.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. It's a win-win for both of us!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a decent share 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would have preferred a 50/50 split, I'm aware of the inflation and the fact that my offer was rejected.  This offer still gives me a decent share, and I don't want to risk losing even more in the next round."
