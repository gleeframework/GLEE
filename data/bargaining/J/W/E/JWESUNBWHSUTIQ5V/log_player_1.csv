"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Although it's a significant amount, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I still have 10 rounds left, and the inflation will work in my favor if we go on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. Bob might be getting a bit more anxious about the inflation, so I'm hoping this offer will appeal to him while still securing a large portion of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, especially considering the significant inflation. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again. I'm betting that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, and he might be willing to settle for a smaller share rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With each passing round, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. This offer is a fair split and accepting it is the safest option considering the inflation."
