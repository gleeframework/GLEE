"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to consider the value of the offer accordingly. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less, which means he's getting a slightly worse deal than in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best offer I can get, so I'll reject it and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly more generous deal, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a better deal and keeping some value for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 65% 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering the offer, I think Bob is pushing his luck a bit too far. I'm not sure if I want to give him 65% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. Maybe he'll come back with a more reasonable offer."

  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some value for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent deal and keeping some value for myself, considering the ongoing inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
