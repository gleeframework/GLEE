"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making the first offer, and I'll take 60% of the money, which is $600,000. Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000. My message to Bob is: ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer"". I'm trying to be reasonable and give Bob a decent share, but also taking into account that I'm making the first move. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation.  Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I still think 45% is too low for me, especially considering I made a more generous offer in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Let's continue the game!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I'll propose a 57.5/42.5 split, with me getting $575,000 and Bob getting $425,000. My message to Bob is: ""Let's meet in the middle and consider the inflation. This is a fair offer"". I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on, while also considering the decreasing value of the money.
{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and consider the inflation. This is a fair offer""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
