"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my share of $600,000 in the first round is now worth $540,000 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I see that he's proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
