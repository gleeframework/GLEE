"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn! This offer is better for you than waiting.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. However, we need to act fast because the value of the money decreases rapidly.
* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice loses value at a much faster rate (20% per round) than I do (5% per round). This means each round she'll be more desperate to make a deal.
* **Strategic Offer:** My offer is still generous but shifts the balance in my favor. The message emphasizes that accepting now is in her best interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** Alice's offer is slightly better, but still heavily favors her.  
* **Inflation Advantage:** The inflation is working strongly in my favor. Her 5800 is now worth significantly less to her than in earlier rounds.
* **Calculated Risk:** While the clock is ticking, I'm willing to risk another rejection to secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Time is running out!  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:**  I'm now mirroring Alice's initial offer, but with the inflation working heavily in my favor. This offer would have been heavily in her favor in Round 1, but is arguably fair now.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message emphasizes that time is running out, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While this is my desired split,  I'm leaving room for Alice to counter-offer with a slightly better deal for her, as long as it's done before inflation eats away too much more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Improvement, Not Enough:** Alice is budging, but her offer is still far from equitable, especially considering the rapidly devaluing money.
* **Leverage:**  With each round, my position strengthens. Her 5600 is worth significantly less, while my potential losses from inflation are shrinking. 
* **Confidence:** I'm betting Alice will be increasingly desperate to make a deal as the rounds progress. I'm willing to push this further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6400,
""alice_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We both lose if this goes any further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** It's time to play hardball. Alice needs to understand I'm serious and won't be pushed around.
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:**  By round 6, the inflation heavily favors me.  Alice's potential gains are diminishing rapidly. 
* **Ultimatum:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm adding pressure and increasing the seriousness of the situation. This might be my last chance to secure a favorable outcome before the dwindling value makes any deal unattractive."
