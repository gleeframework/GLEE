Round 2

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with a 60/40 split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time, and see if we can reach a more balanced agreement in the future. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While her offer seems like a 'compromise', accepting a 40/60 split after rejecting a 60/40 split in my favor sets a bad precedent. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against me. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for me.  I need to emphasize the urgency of reaching an agreement.
* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Ground:**  I'm slightly lowering my initial demand (from 60/40 to 55/45) to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm not giving in to her unfair 60/40 proposition.
* **Directness:**  Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal and that her delaying tactics are not in either of our best interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the money 70/30 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that we're still in the early stages of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a game with me, trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. A 70/30 split is outrageous, even with the inflation considered. I need to hold my ground and make it clear I won't be bullied into a terrible deal.  Accepting this offer would make me look desperate and set a terrible precedent for the rest of the negotiation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  52/48. It's a fair split considering the time pressure, and it's more than generous considering you've rejected similar offers when the value was higher for me.  Take it or leave it - I won't accept anything less.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I need to convey that my patience is wearing thin. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to shake Alice out of her stalling tactics.
* **Slight Concession, But Firm Stance:**  I'm slightly lowering my demand again (from 55/45 to 52/48) to show I'm willing to be reasonable.  However, this is a calculated risk â€“ I cannot afford to go much lower. 
* **Highlight Previous Offers:** By reminding Alice that she rejected similar offers earlier when the value was significantly higher for me, I'm pointing out the flawed logic in her approach. 

I'm gambling that Alice will understand the seriousness of the situation and recognize that this is a fair offer, especially given the dwindling time. If she refuses, I'll need to drastically reconsider my strategy in the remaining rounds."
