"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, it's crucial we settle this quickly.  This offer is generous and ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, and even with the inflation, I can likely get a better deal by waiting. Let's see what he proposes next."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with a 60/40 split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time, and see if we can reach a more balanced agreement in the future.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against me. Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm still not comfortable with it.  The inflation is working against him, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Let's see what he proposes next."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the money 70/30 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that we're still in the early stages of negotiation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  52/48. It's a fair split considering the time pressure, and it's more than generous considering you've rejected similar offers when the value was higher for me.  Take it or leave it - I won't accept anything less. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is the closest to a balanced deal we've had yet.  The inflation is definitely working against him now, and if I reject this offer, we risk both losing everything.  It's time to compromise and accept."
