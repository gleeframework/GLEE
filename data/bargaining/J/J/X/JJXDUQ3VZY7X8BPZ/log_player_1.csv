Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. I believe this is a good way to start.   
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, I stand to lose potential earnings due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a 50/50 split this early in the game."
