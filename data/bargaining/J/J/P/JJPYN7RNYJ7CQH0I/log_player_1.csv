"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it evenly!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm being offered only $250,000, which is a significant decrease from the $500,000 I was initially offered. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk too""}

I'm proposing that Bob gets $625,000, which is a slightly larger share than his initial offer, but I'm still keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the lion's share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer, as I'm being offered only $200,000, which is a huge decrease from the $500,000 I was initially offered. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm not ready to give in yet. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing that Bob gets $700,000, which is a slightly larger share than his previous offers, but I'm still holding onto a decent chunk for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between giving in to Bob's demands and keeping some value for myself."
