"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. With inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 32$ (80% of 40$). I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving up the majority of the money, but Bob's message seems confident and fair.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreased value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally end the game."
