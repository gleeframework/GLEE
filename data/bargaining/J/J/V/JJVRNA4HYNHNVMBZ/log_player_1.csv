Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get the majority of the money right away. It's a risky strategy, but it might work.  I'm not sure if Bob will accept, but I'm willing to gamble on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a serious concern. It's better to take half now than risk getting even less in the next round."
