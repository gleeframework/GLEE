"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to offer. It's a generous starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is not a good deal for me. I lost 80% of my potential gain due to inflation, and my offer was rejected in the previous round. I'm not going to accept this. I believe I can get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm proposing a 72/28 split in my favor. While the inflation hit me hard, I'm still willing to offer a fair share. This offer is in line with my previous proposal, adjusted for the inflation. I believe this is a better deal than Bob's proposal, which would leave me with only 1000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is really impacting my potential gains. I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}
```

I'm proposing a 57.6/42.4 split in my favor. This offer is based on my previous offer, adjusted for the inflation. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share."
