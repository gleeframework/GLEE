350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, your starting offer was quite lopsided. Let's be realistic. Considering the inflation working against you, I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This gives you a decent sum upfront.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, your offer was still a bit too far off.  Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise given the inflation, and it allows us to both walk away with a substantial amount.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we need to wrap this up quickly. I'm offering a 55/45 split, but in MY favor this time.  It's a fair compromise given that another round means we both lose a significant chunk to inflation.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, I'm tired of this back-and-forth. Let's just split the money evenly.  50/50. No more haggling, no more inflation losses. It's the fairest way forward.",Alice,5,
