"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering we both have a stake in this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split in Alice's favor. While there's a time cost for both of us, Alice loses money at a faster rate than I do. I'm willing to gamble on a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was quite lopsided. Let's be realistic. Considering the inflation working against you, I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This gives you a decent sum upfront."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was still a bit too far off.  Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise given the inflation, and it allows us to both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is right about meeting in the middle, but her idea of ""middle"" is still skewed in her favor. I need to push for a more significant shift in the next round, especially since the inflation is starting to really eat into the potential gains."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to wrap this up quickly. I'm offering a 55/45 split, but in MY favor this time.  It's a fair compromise given that another round means we both lose a significant chunk to inflation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm tired of this back-and-forth. Let's just split the money evenly.  50/50. No more haggling, no more inflation losses. It's the fairest way forward. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous. While I could try to squeeze a tiny bit more, the inflation means another round could cost us both dearly. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point."
