"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll receive $5,000, but it's worth only $4,500 in real terms. For Bob, the $5,000 he's offering is worth 95% of its original value, so it's still $4,750 in real terms.

Considering the offer, I'll accept it. The 50/50 split is fair, and I'm willing to take the $4,500.
