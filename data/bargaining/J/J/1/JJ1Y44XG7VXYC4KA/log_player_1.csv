I'm starting with a slightly uneven split, aiming for a fair share but also leaving room for negotiation if Bob is looking for more.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though Bob is getting a larger share, my gain is still worth less than it was in the first round due to inflation.  I believe we can still reach a more mutually beneficial agreement if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split this time. Since inflation is impacting us both, I believe a fair and equal division is the best way to ensure we both get a decent portion of the money."
