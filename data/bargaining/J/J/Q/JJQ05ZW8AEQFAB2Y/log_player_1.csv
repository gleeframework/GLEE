"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a big chunk, but I'm not going easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation effect.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll receive:

$30 (Bob's offer) is worth the same as in the first round, but my gain of $70 is worth 95% of $70, which is $66.50.

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not getting too generous yet!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount I'll receive if I accept this offer:

$25 (Bob's offer) is worth the same as in the first round, but my gain of $75 is worth 85.74% of $75, which is $64.40.

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
