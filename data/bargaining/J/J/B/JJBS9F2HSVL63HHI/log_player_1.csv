"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 and keep 60. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$ and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can have 70, and I'll take 30. It's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70 is worth 70 * 0.9 = 63, and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 30 * 0.8 = 24.

I'll think about it... This offer is better than the previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal. You can have 20, and I'll take 80. It's my best offer so far!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. You can have 85, and I'll take 15. It's my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is catching up!

Let's calculate the value of the offer: 
My gain of 85 is worth 85 * 0.727 = 61.835, and Bob's gain of 15 is worth 15 * 0.516 = 7.74.

Considering the offer, I think it's a good compromise, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer. I'll accept it.
