I'm going to start by being generous, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's an even split, it's significantly less than my initial proposal, and there are still plenty of rounds left. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm reducing my offer slightly to show flexibility. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but still trying to secure a larger share. The inflation is affecting me significantly, but I believe I can still get a better deal than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is really bad for me.  It's significantly less than the previous offer, and the inflation is seriously hurting my potential gains.  I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.  It's risky, but I have to try."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Time is running out, and I need to get a deal before the inflation completely erodes my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer.  The inflation is hitting me very hard, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I'm still better off risking it and going another round.  I need to try to get a larger share, even if it's just a little bit."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to get a better deal. I'm going to propose an even split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can both get something rather than risking getting nothing."
