"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000 and keep $8000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, but I'm still being somewhat generous. Let's see what Bob says!"
