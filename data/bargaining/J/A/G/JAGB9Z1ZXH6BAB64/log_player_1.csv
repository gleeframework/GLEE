"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation impacts us differently. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the 55-45 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52-48 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation impacts.""}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. The inflation is impacting both of us, and this is the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about splitting it evenly, but considering the extreme impact of inflation on the money's value, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise.
