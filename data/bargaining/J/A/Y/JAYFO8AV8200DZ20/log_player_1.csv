"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, it's a fair deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split in my favor, which means I'd get $750,000 and Bob would get $250,000. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair deal."
