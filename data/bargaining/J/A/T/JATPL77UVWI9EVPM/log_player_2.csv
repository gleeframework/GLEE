"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a good deal for you, Bob, considering the inflation and the fact that I'll be the one making a counter-offer if you decline. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's worth it to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice's offer is not so good when you consider the inflation affecting her more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor this time. Remember that the inflation is hitting you harder than me, so it's a good deal for you as well!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer doesn't account for the rapid inflation affecting me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a compromise, and considering the shrinking value, it's the best offer you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the inflation. It's better than the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
