"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a slightly larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, considering the decreasing value of the money. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5380 
# Bob gain: 4620 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! Considering the reduced value, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the difference between the two options is relatively small, I'll accept this offer.
