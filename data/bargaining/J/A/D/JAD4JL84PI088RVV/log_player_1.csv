"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight edge to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and equal split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is really fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve more. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more skewed split, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, so I'll take this one."
