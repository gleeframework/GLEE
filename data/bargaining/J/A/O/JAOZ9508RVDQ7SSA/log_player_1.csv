Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering our respective inflation rates. This ensures a better outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting this deal would mean settling for significantly less than half the original amount after inflation is factored in. It's better to negotiate further and aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the best deal for both of us. Consider the inflation - it's only going to get worse for me. This way, we both walk away with a significant sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I've reduced my initial ask slightly to show willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the time pressure:**  I'm emphasizing the impact of inflation to push for a quicker resolution. 
* **Focusing on the larger gain:**  Even though I'm conceding, I'm highlighting that accepting my offer still means a significant gain for Bob."
