"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a small lead""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% of the initial $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small lead, but not that big 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. With inflation, my gain of $45 is only worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round, so I'm not getting a good deal. I'd like to propose a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the previous round, the effects of inflation are still significant, and I'm not getting a good deal. I'd like to propose a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too big""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a bigger share, but still keeping some advantage for myself."
