"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. It's fair, considering I'm the one taking the inflation hit.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation is going to eat away at my gains rapidly.  I'll be getting 500,000, which is a much better outcome than continuing to risk losing more."
