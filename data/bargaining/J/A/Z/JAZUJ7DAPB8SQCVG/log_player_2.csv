"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm giving you a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems tempting, there's no incentive for me to accept it in the first round. I want to see if I can get a better deal later, especially since the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split.  Let's work together to make sure we both get a fair share before the money loses value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While Alice is offering a slightly better deal than before, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'm confident I can get a better split if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly.  The money is losing value quickly, and a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something.""}
```"
