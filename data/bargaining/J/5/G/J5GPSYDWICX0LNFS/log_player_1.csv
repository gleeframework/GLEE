"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a fairly standard starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'm not too keen on this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
