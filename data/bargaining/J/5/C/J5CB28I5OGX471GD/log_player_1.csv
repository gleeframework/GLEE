"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 20$ in future rounds if you want""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20$ in this round, and I'll take 80$. My message is an attempt to entice Bob to accept the offer by leaving room for future negotiations."
