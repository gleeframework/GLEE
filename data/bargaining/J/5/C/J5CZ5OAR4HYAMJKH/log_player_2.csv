"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. Think about the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side. You're losing value every round. Take this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly using the inflation to her advantage, but her offers are getting greedier. It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll start to become more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline and she risks getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be practical. We're both losing out because of the inflation.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time. Every round, your share is worth less. I'm willing to take a bigger cut, but you need to act fast! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  While time is running out, Alice's offers are still getting worse for me.  She's clearly betting on my fear of getting nothing. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if she gets more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing out by waiting. This offer is a compromise - slightly better for you than 50/50, acknowledging the inflation impact on my side. Let's end this now and both get something!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share. I'm willing to take a bigger cut, but you need to accept now or risk getting even less. This is your last chance for a decent amount! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting too risky now.  While the offer is terrible, rejecting it means I'm putting my faith in Alice offering me *something* in the remaining rounds. Given her increasingly aggressive stance, it's highly likely she'll push for an even larger share, leaving me with a paltry sum or nothing at all.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to take a smaller amount now than risk getting nothing later."
