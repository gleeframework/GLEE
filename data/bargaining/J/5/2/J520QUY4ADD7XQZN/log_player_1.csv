"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to offer Bob $1 and keep $99 for myself. This is a classic strategy in ultimatum games, as it's likely Bob will accept rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I know Bob is likely to get more greedy as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2} 
```

I'll offer Bob $2 this round.  While I'm still aiming for the majority, I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting again. I'm seeing a pattern here.  Bob's offers are getting more generous, but I'm hoping to push for a more even split.  We're still early in the game, and there's no need to settle for this yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split. Bob's increasingly generous offers suggest he's getting nervous. I think this is the best way to ensure we both get a fair share."
