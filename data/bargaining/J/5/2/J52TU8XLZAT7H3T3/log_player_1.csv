"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money ($8,000) and Bob gets 20% ($2,000). I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 50/50 split, as I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money ($6,000) and Bob gets 40% ($4,000). I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob than the previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a fair share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get worried about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. Bob's offer of $4000 for me and $6000 for himself is not great, but it's still a decent deal considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation."
