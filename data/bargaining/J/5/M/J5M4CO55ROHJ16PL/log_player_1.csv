I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round, hoping to secure a large portion of the money before the inflation kicks in.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though I'm losing out on a significant amount of money due to inflation, I'm not willing to settle for such an unfair split. I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm trying to find a middle ground while still ensuring I get a decent share.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, so we need to reach an agreement soon."
