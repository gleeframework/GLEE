"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's more patient 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, considering the inflation factor and the fact that I'm not getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to balance my desire for a fair share with the need to be realistic about the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's offers are getting more similar to my previous one!

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, especially considering the inflation factor is affecting Bob's share less and less with each round. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 60/40 is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
