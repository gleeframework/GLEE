"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain would be 8100 in the first round, but now it's 4500 in the second round.

I'm not sure I like Bob's proposal, as it seems too even-handed for the current situation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer. With the money being worth 10% less again, my gain would be 4050 in the third round.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a fair split, considering the risks and efforts.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 40/60 split. I think it's a fair compromise, and we can get this done before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain would be 7290 in the first round, but now it's 3615 in the fourth round.

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and inflation. I'd rather accept this offer and get something than risk losing even more value in the next round.
