Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
