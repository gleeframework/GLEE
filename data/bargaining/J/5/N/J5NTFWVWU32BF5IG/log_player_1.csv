**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. This means his negotiating position is weakening considerably with each passing round.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might become even more entrenched in his position, leading to a worse outcome for me. 
* **Current Offer vs. Future Losses:** Accepting $4,200 now is better than risking an even lower offer later, or even reaching a stalemate where we both get nothing.

It's a tough decision, but sometimes taking a less-than-ideal offer is the best way to cut losses in a rapidly changing situation."
