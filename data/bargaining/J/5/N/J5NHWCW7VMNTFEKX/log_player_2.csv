"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a small share to get this started. Let's see if we can find a better deal in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While it's tempting to take a small amount now, it's important to remember that each round the money loses value.  It's better to see if a better deal is possible in the next round where I can make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. This offer gives us both a significant share, and we can avoid further devaluation.""}
