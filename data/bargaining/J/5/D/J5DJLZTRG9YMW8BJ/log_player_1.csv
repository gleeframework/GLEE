"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. 

This seems like a fair starting point, considering I have the first offer and the risk of inflation. I want to leave room for negotiation, but I also want to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $150,000 and keeping $850,000 for myself. 

Since I rejected his offer, I'm taking the risk of another round of inflation, but I'm confident that I can still get a good deal. I'm offering a slightly higher amount for Bob, hoping to make him reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While the inflation has significantly impacted my potential earnings, I am better off accepting this offer rather than risking another round and potentially ending up with nothing."
