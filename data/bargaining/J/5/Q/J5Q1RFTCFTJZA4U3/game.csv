70.0,30.0,I propose we divide the money in a 70:30 ratio. This allows us to share the funds while considering the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,I think we can do better than a 70:30 ratio. Let's meet in the middle and split it 50:50. No need to worry about inflation just yet.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
