"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 70:30 ratio. Let's meet in the middle and split it 50:50. No need to worry about inflation just yet. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
