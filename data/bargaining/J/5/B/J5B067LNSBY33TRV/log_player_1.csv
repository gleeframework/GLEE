Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 4500

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most strategically sound option at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome.
* **Bob's Unlikely Shift:** Bob has consistently aimed for a 50/50 split or slightly better. It's improbable he'll suddenly offer a significantly larger share.
* **Guaranteed Loss if Rejected:** If I reject this, the value decreases further, and Bob is in a stronger position to offer even less in the next round.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts my losses and avoids a potentially worse outcome."
