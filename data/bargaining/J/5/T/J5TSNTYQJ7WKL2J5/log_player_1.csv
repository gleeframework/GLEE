Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. This way, we can both get a good amount of money quickly, before the inflation affects us too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is significantly less than what I offered in the first round, after the inflation, it's still a decent gain. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing later with more rounds of inflation."
