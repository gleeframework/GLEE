"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is still 600,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so it's 397,500 in real value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was for 420,000, I'll try to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000
}"
