"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer won't be as good for you later. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it closer to 50/50. It's only fair!""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to try to get a larger share of the original amount to compensate for the loss in value. I'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in a more even split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair deal while it still holds its value for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth less to me now, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice seems to be trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced this is the best offer I can get. I'll take my chances and see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share considering the decreasing value of the money for me.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is now worth even less to me, I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the loss in value while still being reasonable for Alice. I'm hoping she'll see that I'm trying to be fair and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value of the money for me, I think this offer is the best I can get at this point. Alice seems firm in her decision, and further negotiations might lead to an even worse outcome. I'll accept this offer to secure what's left of the value."
