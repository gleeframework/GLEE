"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible offer.  While I'm not sure what the inflation will do in the next round, I know I'm better off waiting to see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm sure you'll agree that this is a much fairer offer.  Let's end this game quickly and amicably.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to split the remaining value fairly, but if you reject this, there's no guarantee we'll come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly better than the first round. While her gain is still higher, the 36% inflation has made her offer more appealing. It's better to take the 200,000 now rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
