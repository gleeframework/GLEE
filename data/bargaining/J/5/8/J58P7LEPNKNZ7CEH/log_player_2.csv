Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Since the inflation is affecting both of us, let's split it 50/50 this round.  It's fair and avoids further risk of losing value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
