"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the new values, I'm not sure if 50-50 is the best deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to improve my chances by making a slightly more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still a good deal!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a slightly more lopsided deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the new values, I'll have to re-evaluate Bob's offer. A 45-55 split is still a bit too lopsided for my taste, especially since I'm already getting less value due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 45-55, I'll try to make a more aggressive move and aim for a better deal. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk for a better split!""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a slightly more lopsided deal in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the new values, I'll have to re-evaluate Bob's offer. A 40-60 split is a very lopsided deal, and I'm not sure if it's worth it, especially since I'm already getting such a low value due to inflation.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
