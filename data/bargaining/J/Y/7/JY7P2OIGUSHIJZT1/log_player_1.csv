"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to propose and want to secure the most value.  This should be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as he gets something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer a larger share, I'm aware of the inflation factor and the risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances and the possibility of further losing value."
