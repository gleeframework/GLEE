"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. Let me know if you agree or would like to proceed to the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's see if you agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a new 52/48 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a similar distribution to the previous round but accounts for the decrease in value of the currency. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. Even with inflation, I'm not convinced a 52/48 split is fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This still accounts for the inflation, and I believe it's a fairer split.""}
