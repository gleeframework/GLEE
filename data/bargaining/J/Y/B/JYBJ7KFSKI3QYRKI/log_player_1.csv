"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, knowing the inflation will impact Bob more than me. I'm hoping he'll take it, but if he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable than my initial proposal. However, it's still not in my best interest to accept.  I'm banking on the fact that the inflation rate is higher for Bob, and I can likely get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a middle ground offer.  I still want a good chunk of the money, but I'm willing to offer Bob a bit more than before, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation further reduces his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. The inflation has hit me hard, but it's even harder on him. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly upward again, hoping to find a point where Bob will accept. The inflation is significantly impacting both of us, but I still believe I can secure a better deal than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is significantly better than the previous one, it's still not acceptable. The inflation has hit me hard, but I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds. I'll keep pushing for a fairer split, hoping to reach an agreement before time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still trying to secure a good deal. I'm offering a slightly higher share for Bob, hoping to make it more appealing. If he rejects this offer, I'm worried we might be running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation has hit me hard, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm not happy with the offer, but I'm afraid that if I reject it, I might end up with nothing. This offer is still better than nothing, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might lose out entirely."
