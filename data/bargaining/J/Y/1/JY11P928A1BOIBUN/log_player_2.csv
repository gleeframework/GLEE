""alice_gain"": 550000,

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but 55/45 isn't quite there yet. How about 57.5/42.5? 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000

""alice_gain"": 540000,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out. 56/44 is my final offer.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, which is good.  While she's coming down, it's still better for me to push for a better deal.  Two more rejections, and she'll be losing more than I would gain by accepting this offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. 52/48.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this falls apart. Don't let greed get in the way of a good deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising again to avoid a deadlock. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. Let's close this at 54/46. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The tide has turned. While I rejected this offer before, the inflation is hitting Alice hard now. Accepting 54/46 at this stage is better than risking getting a worse deal, or even nothing, in the remaining rounds."
