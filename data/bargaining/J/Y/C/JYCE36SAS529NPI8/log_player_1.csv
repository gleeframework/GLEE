I'm going for a slightly aggressive opening move, hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on. 
Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one. While I'm getting less than I wanted in the first round, I don't want to be left with nothing. I'm going to reject this offer and hope Bob comes back with something more reasonable in the next round.  I still have time to negotiate, and the inflation factor is getting bigger with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm taking a step back from my initial aggressive offer. I'm offering Bob a larger share this round to show I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will lead to a more collaborative negotiation and avoid a stalemate."
