"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you get $400,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable split to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is $300,000 * 0.9 = $270,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a much larger share for Bob. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about we split it 55-45?""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation effect, and I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still want a bit more. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is $450,000 * 0.7279 = $327,555.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's still a relatively small share for me. I'll reject it.
