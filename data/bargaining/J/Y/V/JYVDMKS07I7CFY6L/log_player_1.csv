I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me taking the larger share. This seems like a fair starting point given I'm the one making the initial offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking a very aggressive stance, and I don't want to be left with just $1000 (even if it was worth more in the first round). It's time to show him I'm not afraid to play this game. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm dropping my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent portion. This shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of getting almost nothing. I'm hoping this compromise will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is pushing his luck!  I'm not going to settle for a deal where I get significantly less than what I offered him.  Let's see how he likes the taste of his own medicine for a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm also trying to be reasonable.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before things get even more difficult for him.  I'm not willing to go any lower than this."
