Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal.  There's a chance Alice doesn't know about the inflation, so I'll see if I can get a bigger cut."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, I'll take 70% and you get 30%. This way we both get something substantial."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk myself. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even with the inflation, this is still a good deal.  I'm not sure Alice fully understands the inflation impact yet, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
