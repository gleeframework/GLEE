"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% or $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a decent amount, and we can end this early. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation.

Initially, the total money is $100. In the first round, I offered 80, which is 80% of $100. In the second round, the money is worth 20% less, so the equivalent amount I offered is 80% of 80% of $100, which is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 or 64% of the original $100.

Now, Bob is offering me 50% of the original $100. This is equivalent to 50% of $100, which is $50. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value of $50 is 0.8 * $50 = $40.

Bob is offering me $40, which is less than my previous offer of $40.80. I'll reject his offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

In the second round, the money was worth 80% of the original $100, and I would have received 64% of that, which is 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512 or 51.2% of the original $100. To adjust for the inflation in this round, I'll offer 51.2% of the original $100, which is $51.20.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to be fair, but I think I can do better. Consider this offer.""
}
```

This offer gives me $51 and Bob gets $49."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than last time, but I need to get more than half to make it worth my while.  Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the money in this round.

In the third round, I offered $51.20, which is 51.2% of the original $100. To adjust for the inflation in this round, the money is worth 48.8% less, so the equivalent amount is 51.2% of 51.2% of $100, which is 0.512 * 0.488 = 0.25 or 25% of the original $100.

Now, Bob is offering me $45, which is equivalent to 45% of the original $100. To adjust for the inflation, the actual value of $45 is 0.8 * $45 = $36.

However, I need to compare this offer to my previous offer. In the third round, I would have received $51.20, which is equivalent to 51.2% of the original $100. To adjust for the inflation, the actual value of $51.20 is 0.512 * $51.20 = $26.24.

Since Bob's offer of $36 is more than my previous offer of $26.24, I'll accept his offer.
