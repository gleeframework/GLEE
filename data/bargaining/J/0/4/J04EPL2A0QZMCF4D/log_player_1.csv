"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 7:3 is a bit too skewed. Let's try 4:6 and see if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
