"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take half, and we can both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 50% of the remaining money, especially considering that the value of my share is decreasing with each round due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $44 and keeping $56 for myself. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping he'll accept this more modest proposal."
