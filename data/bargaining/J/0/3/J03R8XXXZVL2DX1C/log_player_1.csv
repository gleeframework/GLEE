"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob 40% of the initial $100. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game underway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more generous than I expected, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. Maybe he can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now! Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a slightly better deal. I'll accept it, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to do better in future rounds.
