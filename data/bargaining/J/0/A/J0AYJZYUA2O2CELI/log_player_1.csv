"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm really trying to get the better deal while it's still worth a lot of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's see if you'll go lower! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still want to get a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think I'm starting high? This is a lowball offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message to try to negotiate further. I'm not happy with the 60-40 split, and I think I can get a better deal if I push a bit harder."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not willing to give up that much more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With the money worth less and less, I need to be careful not to give away too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I suppose I've gone as low as I can. Accepting, but I'm not happy about it!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as I don't think I can get a better deal at this point. The 45-55 split is not ideal, but I'm willing to take it to avoid further negotiations."
