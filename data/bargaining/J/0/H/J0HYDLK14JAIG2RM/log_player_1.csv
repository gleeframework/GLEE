"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share considering I'm the first to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 90.5% of what it was in the first round. Since I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob, I'll have to be cautious. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since my previous gain of 60 was worth 95% of the original value, I'll aim for a slightly lower amount. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain, I'll have to be more careful. However, this offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
