**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to use the inflation against me, but I need to hold firm for a better deal. While the value of the money is decreasing, getting $4,000 is a significant loss compared to what I could potentially get. It's still early in the game, and I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and we get closer to losing it all."

{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this offer still gives you a larger share to account for the inflation difference. Let's take it and avoid walking away with nothing.""}
