"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'd rather not give Bob a larger share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
