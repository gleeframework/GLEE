"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to share more than half, but I need a good chunk to make this worthwhile. Accept this and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, but I'm not sure if it's enough to end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This inflation is getting out of hand!  Let's split this 50/50 and be done with it. We both know the longer this goes on, the less we'll both get. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'm getting desperate. Bob's 50/50 offer is starting to look more appealing. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer.
