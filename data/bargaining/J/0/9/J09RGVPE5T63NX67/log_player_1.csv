Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split, which is more fair considering the decreasing value of the money for us both. This way, we can both get a reasonable share while also taking into account the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
