"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to recognize that the value of the money diminishes with each round. While Alice offered a seemingly ""fair"" 60/40 split in her favor, the decreasing value makes it less appealing to Bob in subsequent rounds.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals that he's not settling for a deal that doesn't consider the time factor.  
* **New Offer:** Bob's counter-offer of $5200 for himself and $4800 for Alice might seem slightly advantageous to him at first glance. However, it takes into account the inflation. This offer aims to secure a larger portion before the value decreases further while still being reasonable enough for Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer is still tilted in her favor.  Here's why Bob should hold out:

* **Trend:** Alice's offers have been steadily decreasing for Bob ($6000, then $5800). This indicates a potential willingness to negotiate further as time goes on.
* **Future Leverage:**  With each round, the inflation hurts Alice more than Bob. This gives Bob increasing bargaining power in future rounds. 

**It's time for Bob to stand firm and wait for a more favorable offer in the next round.**"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, this is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reversal:** Bob has been patient, and now it's time to flip the script. By offering Alice slightly *less* than she proposed in Round 3 ($4200 vs. her offer of $4200 for Bob), he's applying pressure.
* **Time Sensitivity:** The ""final offer"" tactic introduces urgency. It signals to Alice that Bob is serious and won't keep negotiating indefinitely. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  While the offer might seem bold, Bob knows that with each round, the impact of inflation makes the difference between their offers less significant. It's better to secure a favorable split now before the value erodes further.
* **Psychological Edge:** This offer might prompt Alice to reconsider her position and potentially accept to avoid an even less favorable outcome in a potential Round 5."
