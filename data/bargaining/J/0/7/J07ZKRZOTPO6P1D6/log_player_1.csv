Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for more, but this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  It's the only way to maximize our returns at this point.

# Bob gain: 500000

It's painful, but I need to accept. Bob is holding firm, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
