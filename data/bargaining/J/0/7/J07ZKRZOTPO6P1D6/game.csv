600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $600,000 and you get $400,000. It makes sense to settle now rather than risk losing money to inflation.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly.  This way, we both get a fair share and avoid any potential losses from inflation.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fair share, but time is working against us. I'm proposing $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a good deal considering the inflation we're facing.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm sticking to my proposal.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, and we're both losing value with each passing round.  Let's end this now and avoid any further losses.",Bob,4,

525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This offer is slightly better for you than my last, and every round that passes hurts us both.  Let's settle on $525,000 for me and $475,000 for you.",Alice,5,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I understand your desire for more, but this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  It's the only way to maximize our returns at this point.",Bob,6,
