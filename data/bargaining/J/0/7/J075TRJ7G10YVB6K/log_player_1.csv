"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 6:4, with me getting the larger share. This is a better deal for me considering the inflation, but I still believe it's fair for us both to get a significant portion of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
