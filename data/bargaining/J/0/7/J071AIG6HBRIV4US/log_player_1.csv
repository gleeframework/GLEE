Send your offer to divide $100.","{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I could try to be greedy and reject, it's not a good long-term strategy.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value with each round.  Even if I get a better offer later, it will be worth less than this one.
* **Risk:**  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. Bob might just keep offering a 50/50 split, and I'll lose out on money with each rejection.
* **Fairness:** While the initial offer was unfair, Bob's offer is reasonable. It's a fair split in the context of the game's rules.

Accepting ensures I get something, and it's a decent amount considering the inflation factor."
