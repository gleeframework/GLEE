Round 3

Round 5

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking!  This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gains is decreasing significantly with each round. Accepting $4950 now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently offered slightly more to herself in each round. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a much better deal for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly. 

While not ideal, taking the $4950 now secures Bob something rather than potentially nothing."
