"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. My message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's split it more fairly! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $95,000.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'm only getting a relatively small share. However, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer, so I'll accept this one.
