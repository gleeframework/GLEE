"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so the total amount available is $800,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $450,000, which is 56.25% of the current total, and Bob would gain $550,000, which is 68.75% of the current total.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I want it to be exactly in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the current total amount available: $1,000,000 is now worth 64% of its original value, so the total amount available is $640,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $500,000, which is 78.13% of the current total, and Bob would gain $500,000, which is 78.13% of the current total. This is indeed a 50-50 split, exactly in the middle.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise.
