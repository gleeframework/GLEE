"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm losing money with each round. This offer is fair and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
