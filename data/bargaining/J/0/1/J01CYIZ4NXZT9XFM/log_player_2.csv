"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from dividing the money now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a fair offer in the first round, I want to see if I can get a better deal later.  Since the money inflates differently for each of us, I'm hoping to leverage that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than Alice's offer.  Let's split the money closer to even, and I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the inflation difference.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a reasonable offer considering the inflation rate is affecting you more than me. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation is hitting me harder, this offer is still a good deal. The difference in our inflation rates is significant enough that I'm unlikely to get a better offer.  It's time to settle."
