"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer sounds generous, it's crucial to remember the inflation factor. Even though this seems like a good deal now, with each passing round, my potential gains could be drastically reduced. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money equally. This way, we both get a good share, even considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to be generous, but I need to get a better share to compensate for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the inflation has impacted my potential earnings, I'm still hesitant to accept such a lopsided deal. I believe I can still get a more equitable split, especially as I'm aware of the inflation's effect on Alice's gains as well."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a better deal than your last offer.  Inflation affects us both, so let's work together to ensure we both get something worthwhile.""}
