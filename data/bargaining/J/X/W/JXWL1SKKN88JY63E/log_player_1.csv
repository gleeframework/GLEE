I'm starting with a fairly even split, but slightly favoring myself since I have the advantage of a smaller inflation rate. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not happy with this offer. While it is true that the money is worth less each round, I'm still losing ground by accepting this. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this round. Since the money is worth less each round, I'm willing to make a concession. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than his last offer."
