"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping the majority for myself and giving Bob a small share. This gives me a solid starting point, and I believe Bob might accept it as it's better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While a 40/60 split is a significant gain for me, it's still a considerable loss from my previous offer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, aiming for a middle ground. This should be more appealing to Bob than the previous round's offer, while still giving me a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired outcome, and the inflation is making it more difficult to secure a better deal. Accepting this offer is the most sensible move at this point."
