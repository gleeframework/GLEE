"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 3:7 is a more reasonable split, let's try this 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gains due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's new offer.

After calculating the new values, I see that Bob is proposing a 3:7 split, which means I would get $7,000 and Bob would get $3,000. While it's still not my initial proposal, I think this is a slightly more reasonable split.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
