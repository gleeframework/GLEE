"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping to get more than 40 dollars, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob gets 60 dollars. I'll make a new proposal for Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
