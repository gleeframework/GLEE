"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 20% of the remaining amount. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion of the remaining amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give up yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at Bob's share! I'll think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I still think I can do better than 40% of the remaining amount. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm still willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal by offering Bob an even smaller share, but still a significant portion of the remaining amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! I'll think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, 55% of the remaining amount is a relatively good deal for me. I'm willing to take it, especially since the game is getting close to the 12-round limit."
