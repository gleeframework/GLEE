"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. This ensures we both benefit from dividing the money early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate for me is a significant concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than $4,000. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but your offer was too low for me.  I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is a smaller gap than my previous offer, reflecting the decreasing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has slightly improved her offer, I still believe I can negotiate for a better split, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the deadline and losing money with every round.  I'm adjusting my offer to $5,600 for me and $4,400 for you.  It reflects the urgency of the situation while still trying to be fair given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better and Alice is acknowledging the urgency of the situation, the impact of inflation on my gain is substantial. Given that we still have a few rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk to negotiate for a better deal, hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise as the deadline approaches. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5900, ""alice_gain"": 4100, ""message"": ""Considering we're halfway through the rounds and inflation is significantly impacting my gain, I believe a 59-41 split is necessary to compensate for the loss in value. This is my most generous offer yet, and I hope we can conclude the game here to minimize further losses.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair but we're running out of time. This is my final offer above 5000. I get $5,400 and you get $4,600.  Let's close this deal and avoid losing even more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my gain and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. Alice's offer of $4,600, although not ideal, is a reasonable compromise considering the urgency of the situation and the potential loss of the entire amount if we fail to agree."
