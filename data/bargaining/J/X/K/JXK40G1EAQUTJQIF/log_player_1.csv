"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can negotiate further if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I want a bit more. Will you meet me halfway? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My gain: $3,000 / 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation) = $3,157.89
* Bob's gain: $7,000 / 0.8 (1 - 0.20 inflation) = $8,750

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, but I'm willing to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable meeting you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer: 4500 for me and 5500 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my counteroffer from last round. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm still proposing a 45-55 split, but this time I'm making it clear that it's a fair split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small step back, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Will you meet me halfway again? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My gain: $4,000 / 0.8587 (1 - 0.1413 inflation) = $4,657.35
* Bob's gain: $6,000 / 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838 inflation) = $11,655.93

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway again, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable meeting you halfway again. I'll make a new counteroffer: 4200 for me and 5800 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my counteroffer from last round. This is a fair split, considering the inflation and the previous offers.""
}
```

I'm still proposing a 42-58 split, and I'm emphasizing that it's a fair split considering the previous offers and the inflation."
