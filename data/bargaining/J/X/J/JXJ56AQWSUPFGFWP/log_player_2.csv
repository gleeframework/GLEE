"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a more equitable offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and offer a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor. This reflects the value loss from inflation, while still being a reasonable offer. Let's wrap this up and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation makes this a good deal for me. Let's end this game before things get worse!"
