"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept this offer,  it's better to see if Alice is willing to give me more. There are many rounds to go, and with each round, the money I get will be worth less.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would like to get more, the money is losing value rapidly. It's better to accept this offer and secure some money now before it becomes worth even less."
