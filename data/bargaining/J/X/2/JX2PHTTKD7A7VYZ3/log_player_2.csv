Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - due to inflation, holding out hurts you more than it hurts me. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the time value of money in this game.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each round. I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the remaining value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
