"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - due to inflation, holding out hurts you more than it hurts me. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the time value of money in this game. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
