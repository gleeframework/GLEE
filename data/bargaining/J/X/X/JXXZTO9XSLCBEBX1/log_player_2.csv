"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. It made sense to reject it, signaling that I'm aiming for a fairer deal. 
* **My Counter-Offer:** I've proposed a split where I get slightly more than Alice. While this might seem a tad aggressive, remember:
    * **Inflation Impact:**  The money loses value with each round. It's more important for me to secure a larger portion now than to wait for a potentially ""fairer"" deal later.
    * **Negotiation Tactic:**  This offer is still better than what Alice would get if she rejects and I propose a heavily favorable deal in the next round (due to the inflation difference). This encourages her to accept a slightly less favorable deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's end this, I'm being generous considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough considering the faster rate of inflation affecting my potential gains. While she calls it ""generous,"" it's important to remember that waiting benefits her more than me. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a good deal considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's wrap this up.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Clock is Ticking:** Inflation is eating into the value of the money, and it's hurting me more than Alice. Prolonging the game is risky.
* **Balancing Act:**  While I want a larger share, I need to offer Alice a deal tempting enough to accept. This offer is still tilted in my favor but acknowledges the decreasing overall value. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and indicating that I'm serious about reaching a deal now. This might push Alice to accept rather than risk a less favorable outcome in a potential Round 5."
