"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20. I'll get the larger share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you'll still get a decent amount. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's effectively $3800.

I'm not too thrilled with the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
