"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which is $5,500, and Bob will receive 45%, which is $4,500. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable and fair division. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle of our previous offers""
}\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and the fact that Bob was willing to split it evenly, so I've made a new offer that is closer to the middle of our previous proposals. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
