Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a split of 90$ for me and 10$ for Bob. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share, but also leaves a significant amount for me.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation makes the money worth less with each round. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas rejecting it risks losing everything in later rounds."
