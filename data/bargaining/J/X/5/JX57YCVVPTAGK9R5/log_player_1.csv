"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share for a faster resolution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I appreciate Bob's willingness to compromise.

I'll consider his offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 450,000 and hope that the game ends soon."
