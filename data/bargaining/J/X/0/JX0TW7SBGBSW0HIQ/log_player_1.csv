"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, and I'll take 60%. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game quickly if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Splitting it evenly seems fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best strategy given the inflation rates. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I still need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer you a slightly better deal this time, but I still need to get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. While it's a slightly better deal than the previous one, I'm not sure if it's enough to justify accepting it.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! With the money worth 76.8% of its original value, I need to be more aggressive in my offer.

I'll try to get a better deal for myself, but I'll still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time.  I'm willing to give you a bit less this time, but we need to reach an agreement soon or both of us will lose out. It's better to take something than nothing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The clock is ticking, and the inflation is really hurting my potential gain! Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Considering the time pressure and the decreasing value of money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise, and I'd rather take 40% of the remaining value than risk losing out on the deal.
