"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth even less than 5000 was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 6000 is worth even more than 5000 was in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. For now, I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```
I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in this round, aiming for a slightly higher gain than before, while still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain of 3500 is worth even less than I initially thought, and Bob's gain of 6500 is still a significant amount.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it. On one hand, the money is decreasing in value rapidly, and I might not get a better offer in the next round. On the other hand, I don't want to give up too much to Bob.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is getting worse! Considering the decreasing value of money, my offer for Round 5 is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```
I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive again, aiming for a higher gain to compensate for the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. My gain of 3000 is worth significantly less than I initially thought, and Bob's gain of 7000 is still a substantial amount.

Considering the rapid decrease in value, I think I should be more cautious and try to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is getting out of control! Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, my offer for Round 7 is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```
I'm trying to be more aggressive and take a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept. The value of money is decreasing so rapidly that I need to be more confident in my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing the value of money! My gain of 2500 is worth a tiny fraction of what I initially thought, and Bob's gain of 7500 is still a significant amount.

At this point, I think I should be more realistic about the value of money and try to get a deal done. I'll accept the offer.
