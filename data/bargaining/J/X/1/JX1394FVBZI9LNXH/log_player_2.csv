Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:**  Every round my potential gains decrease significantly. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's consistently aimed for a larger share and seems content to let time work against me.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance I'll be forced to accept even less in a future round, or even end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement. 

Accepting a 42/58 split isn't what I wanted, but it's the most rational decision given the circumstances."
