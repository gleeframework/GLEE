I'm going for a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair offer, and I'd rather take a guaranteed $5000 than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
