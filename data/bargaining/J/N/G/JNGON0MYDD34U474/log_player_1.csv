"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's rules. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same value as in the previous round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55/45 is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal, but it's still a reasonable split. I'll decide to accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
