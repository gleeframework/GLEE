I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  It's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 for myself and $150,000 for Bob.  While I'm willing to compromise, I still need a significant portion of the money to offset the inflation."
