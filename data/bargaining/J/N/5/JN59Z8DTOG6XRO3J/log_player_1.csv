  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to get us going. Accept and we can finish the game.""

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

Alice's gain: 6000 (20% of 9000)
Bob's gain: 3800 (95% of 4000)

I'll reject this offer:
