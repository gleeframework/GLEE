"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to divide the money, and we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $9,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll consider the new amounts.

Bob's proposal is to split the money evenly, which would mean I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000.

I accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
