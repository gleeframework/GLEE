600000.0,400000.0,"Let's be fair and start with 60-40. It's the first round, and we both get a good amount. The money is still worth a lot!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Your 60-40 split seems a bit unbalanced to me. How about we meet closer to the middle with a 55-45 split? This way, we both still walk away with a significant sum.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"I see you're willing to negotiate! I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking, and we're both losing money due to inflation.  I'm proposing 52-48. It's a strong offer, and it benefits us both to agree now rather than later.",Bob,4,

560000.0,440000.0,"I understand your sense of urgency, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about 56-44? It's still a compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time and both get something substantial.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is fair, clean, and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains.",Bob,6,
