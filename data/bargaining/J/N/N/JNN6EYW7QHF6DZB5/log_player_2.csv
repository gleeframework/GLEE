Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your sense of urgency, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about 56-44? It's still a compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split,  the rate of inflation is working heavily in my favor. It's in Alice's best interest to settle sooner, so I'll continue to apply pressure. Accepting 44% now is still worse than potentially getting 48% or more in later rounds, even with inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and both get something substantial.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is fair, clean, and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and inflation is increasingly detrimental.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair and might be more appealing to Alice now that she's seeing I'm willing to walk away from uneven deals. 
* **Maximizing Gains:** While I could push for a slightly higher percentage, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and inflation further devaluing the money makes a 50/50 split the safest and most logical option at this stage."
