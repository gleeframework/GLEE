Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation advantage I have.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more,  it's better to take the $5,000 now.  The inflation will eat away at my share if we keep going."
