Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will take it in the first round.  It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage he faces in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 10/90 split. While I'm losing a lot in this round due to inflation, rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose again in the next round.  My offer will likely be more favorable to me then, as Bob's gains will continue to be diminished by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm proposing an 85/15 split in my favor.  This is still a significant advantage for me, but considering the inflation, it's a reasonable offer that should entice Bob to accept. He's losing more value each round, and if he rejects this, he'll likely end up with less in the next round."
