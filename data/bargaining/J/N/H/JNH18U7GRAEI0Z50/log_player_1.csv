Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive offer.  Since I don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'll try to secure the vast majority of the money in the first round.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation means the money is losing value.  Accepting the offer in this round ensures I get at least half of the original amount."
