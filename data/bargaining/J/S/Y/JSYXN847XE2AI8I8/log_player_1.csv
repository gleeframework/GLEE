"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, Alice. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
