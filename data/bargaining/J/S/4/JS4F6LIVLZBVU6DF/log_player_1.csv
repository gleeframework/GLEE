"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to be more careful. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round for me. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving up enough, I'm taking a slightly bigger share to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round for me, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still not great, but it's slightly better than before.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
