"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a fairer split this time. This offer considers the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, even with the inflation factor, to aim for a more equitable split. 

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:**
    * Bob is proposing a slightly more advantageous split for himself (48/52) compared to Alice's (40/60). 
    * The message emphasizes fairness and subtly introduces the concept of time value (inflation making later rounds less valuable). This might nudge Alice to accept a less extreme offer in her favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Explanation:**

Alice is trying to leverage the inflation factor to her advantage. While she's offering slightly more than her first proposal, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out. Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Timing:**  We're getting to a critical point.  With each round, the value decreases significantly.  It's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a slightly better deal.

* **Fairness as Leverage:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair.  By proposing this, Bob puts the pressure on Alice.  If she rejects it now, she's signaling that she's willing to risk getting a worse deal due to inflation, which could seem unreasonable. 

* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that time is running out. This adds subtle pressure on Alice to accept the offer now before the value diminishes even further."
