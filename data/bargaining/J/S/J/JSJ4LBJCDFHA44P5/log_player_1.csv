"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'm going to try to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially getting 20% less than what I initially offered Bob, which was 900,000. Considering Bob's offer is 800,000, which is 20% more than what I initially offered him, I think I'm being taken advantage of.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a more cautious offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer. Think carefully before rejecting!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to get a better deal in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm going to try to take advantage! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation! The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to the cumulative inflation.

Considering the offers I've made so far, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'm getting a larger share than in my previous offers, and it's a relatively good deal given the circumstances.

I'll accept this offer.
