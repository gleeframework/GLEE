"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value of the money Bob gains, but I'm willing to consider his offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob taking a 60% share, and I think I can do better. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to balance the scales""}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and take a bit less, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share!

After considering the new offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as it's still a relatively fair split, considering the inflation. I'll take the $4800 and hope that the game ends here."
