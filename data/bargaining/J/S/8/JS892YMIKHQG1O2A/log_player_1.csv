"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a relatively even split, with a slight advantage to myself to account for the fact that the money loses value over time. This should be an attractive offer to Bob, as he'll still receive a significant amount of money, and the difference between our shares is not drastic. The message ""Let's be fair"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but I think we can both do better. Let's find a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, although he's trying to appear generous, the split is still not in my favor, especially considering the money is worth 20% less to me now. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Getting late, let's settle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking into account that the money is losing value over time. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency with my message, implying that it's better for both of us to settle now rather than continue negotiating and losing even more value. This offer still gives Bob a significant amount, but prioritizes my own gain due to the increasing impact of inflation on my side."
