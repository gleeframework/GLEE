Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give $1,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair start, considering the inflation will affect Bob's share more heavily in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is a bit more fair than my previous one, but I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $4,000.  While I still want to get the most I can, I need to be mindful of the inflation and make sure Bob has a reasonable incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him, but I still feel like I can negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject and see what he comes up with next."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob an even split. The inflation is getting pretty bad, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
