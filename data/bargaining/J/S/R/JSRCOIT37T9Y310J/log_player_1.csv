I'm going to try and get a slightly better deal than Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll accept this split, as we're running out of rounds."

I'm still hoping for a better deal, and I think I can get it. Bob's offers are getting worse with each round, and I'm not giving up yet."

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd prefer more, Bob's offers are getting increasingly worse. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue rejecting and risk getting nothing."
