I'm going for a strong starting offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation has already reduced my potential earnings, and if I reject this, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
