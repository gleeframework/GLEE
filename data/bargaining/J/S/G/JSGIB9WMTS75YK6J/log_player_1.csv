"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 2:1 is a more reasonable split, considering the uncertainty of inflation. I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share than the initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
