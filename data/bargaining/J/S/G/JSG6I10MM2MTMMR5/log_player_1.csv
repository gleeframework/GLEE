  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get the better deal, but I'm not going to let him get away with it that easily.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```

I'm hoping that Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less and less, Bob. Time to meet me halfway.""

Round 4

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll do some quick math to see if this offer is better than my previous one. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, $520,000 is actually equivalent to $375,000 in the first round. And since I'm getting $480,000, which is equivalent to $480,000 in the first round, I'm getting a slightly better deal than before.

However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with an even better deal.
