75.0,25.0,"Let's split the money in a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75$, you'll get 25$. It's fair, isn't it?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
49.0,51.0,I think a 51/49 split is fairer.  Let's start with a more equal division and see where it goes.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,I propose a 60/40 split. This maintains a reasonable difference while still being fairly generous. Let me know what you think.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's try an even split this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so I think a 50/50 split is the best way to maximize what we both get.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
