"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is now worth 21% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to get a better deal before the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a relatively even split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer.
