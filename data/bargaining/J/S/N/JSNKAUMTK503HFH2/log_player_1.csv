"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This is a fairly generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"

Round 2

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was close, but I wanted to get a better deal, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 25
