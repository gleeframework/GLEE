"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is taking the inflation into account, but I'll consider it.

Since I'm now worth 10% less, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more this time. Since my potential gain is now worth 90% of the initial value, I'll offer to take 60% of the remaining $10,000.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% this round, leaving you with 40%. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not giving up too much. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! My potential gain is now worth only 72.9% of the initial value. Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not getting as much as I'd like, but it's a slightly better deal than before.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round.
