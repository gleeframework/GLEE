"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Now, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the money and Bob gets 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since it's still a 50-60 split, I'll think it's a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of money.
