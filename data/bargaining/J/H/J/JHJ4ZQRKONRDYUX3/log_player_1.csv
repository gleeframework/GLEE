"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer or if he wants to negotiate further."
