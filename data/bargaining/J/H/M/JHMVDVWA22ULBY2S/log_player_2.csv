"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal. With the inflation, I need to be more aggressive early on to make sure I get a good share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slightly different split this time, with a higher percentage for me due to the potential for inflation.  We can always adjust later if we both agree.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share this time, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the inflation is hitting hard, I'm going to accept this offer.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and 70 dollars is still a decent amount, especially considering the dwindling value of the money with each round. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing."
