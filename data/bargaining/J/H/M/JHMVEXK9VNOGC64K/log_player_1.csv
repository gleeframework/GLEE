"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A good start, but I'm hoping for a better split. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is getting worse!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more aggressive this time. Don't want to leave too much on the table!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly more favorable share, but not so much that Bob will reject it outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential earnings now!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I think Bob's offer is a good one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value in my potential gain."
