Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the offer now.

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to split the remaining value evenly. Accept this and we'll both get something.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. You can't expect to get the same value as before. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the offer. While I'm getting a much smaller share due to inflation, I'm still better off taking what I can get rather than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
