"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point.  What do you say?

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm reducing my share, but still need to keep the majority due to the inflation. Accept this, and we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation.  I need to signal I'm willing to play hardball for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating our money!  My offer is fair and ensures we both benefit. Let's close this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This is the fairest offer I can make. Let's split it evenly and walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is fair, especially given the time pressure and the fact that Alice is losing money at a faster rate.  It's better to accept this now than risk getting a worse offer or even nothing in the remaining rounds."
