"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'll take the lion's share. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice is being ""fair"" by giving Bob something, it's a very small amount. It's better to reject and see if Alice will offer more in the next round, especially since Bob's share will be worth more after the 20% inflation discount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more even split. Let's see if we can reach a deal before the money loses value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still taking the bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise a little. This is my final offer before the money becomes worthless. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, it's still very lopsided. With the inflation, Bob is losing out significantly.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share to ensure we both get something before the money becomes worthless. Let's agree on this and avoid losing everything.""}
