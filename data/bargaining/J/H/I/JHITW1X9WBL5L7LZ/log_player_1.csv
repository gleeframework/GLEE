# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer.

For now, I'll reject this offer.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure if I can do better.
