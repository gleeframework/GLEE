"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large majority of the money, but still offers Bob a significant sum. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept, as he knows the money will decrease in value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation factor makes accepting this offer a more rational choice.  It's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round."
