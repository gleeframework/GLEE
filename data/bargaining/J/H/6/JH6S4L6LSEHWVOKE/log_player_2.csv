"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority and leave you a small piece.  But remember, with each round, the money is worth less to me. It's in your best interest to take this deal.

# Alice gain: 9000

{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced 40/60 split.  Consider that your share decreases in value each round. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Remember, each round hurts my share more than yours.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share, even though the value of her share is decreasing.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to meet you halfway, Bob. We both need to make concessions to avoid the risk of getting nothing. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's latest offer is a regression from her Round 3 offer, even though the value of her share continues to decrease significantly. This indicates she may be getting desperate and willing to settle for less than her initial demands. I will hold firm for now."
