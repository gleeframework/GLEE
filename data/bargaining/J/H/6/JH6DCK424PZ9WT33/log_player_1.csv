"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to be too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so my gain of $6,000 is equivalent to $4,800 in the first round's value.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping for a bit more, considering the inflation has already reduced my gain by 20%. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time around. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better deal. I'll give you a small share, but I need a significant portion to make this worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000. My message is a bit more assertive, trying to convey that I'm willing to take a risk to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to your lowball offer. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round. Considering the previous offers, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer as well. The inflation has reduced my gain significantly, and I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll try to be more realistic and make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up. I'll take a huge risk to get a better deal. Meet me at this price, or I'll walk away.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor, with me getting $9,500 and Bob getting $500. My message is a bit more confrontational, trying to convey that I'm willing to take a huge risk to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to your desperation. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not going to get taken advantage of. You're getting close to walking away, but I'm not there yet. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to ravage my potential gain, my $7,500 is now worth only about $2,536 in the first round's value. Considering the previous offers, I'm getting desperate, but I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer as well. The inflation has reduced my gain to a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round, and I'm not willing to accept a 75/25 split. I'm getting close to walking away, but I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation having reduced my potential gain to almost nothing, I'll make a very aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9800,
  ""bob_gain"": 200,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options. I'll take a huge risk to get a better deal. Meet me at this price, or I'll walk away and leave you with the entire amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 98/2 split in my favor, with me getting $9,800 and Bob getting $200. My message is a desperate attempt to get a better deal, trying to convey that I'm willing to take an enormous risk to get a good outcome."
