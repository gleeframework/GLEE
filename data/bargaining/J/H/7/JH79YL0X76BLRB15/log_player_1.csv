"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is fairer, considering we're both taking a risk with the potential inflation. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and Bob's offer is 65% for me, which is 20% less than my initial 60% gain, I'll consider it a fair deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
