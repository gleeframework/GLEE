"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the original $10,000, which is a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $9,000 in the first round is now worth $9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'll think about it...

I accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
