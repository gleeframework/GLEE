"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair. Let's try 51 for me and 49 for you. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51-49 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I'm willing to hold out for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? I think this is a fairer split than the previous offers.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."
