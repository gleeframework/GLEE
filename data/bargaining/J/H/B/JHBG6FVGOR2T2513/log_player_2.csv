Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is generous considering the time pressure and the fact that your potential gains are decreasing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm being more than fair. You need to consider that your position is getting worse with each round. Don't miss this opportunity! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gains, even with the inflation. It's worth the risk to hold out for a better offer for a few more rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my guns.  A 65/35 split is more than fair considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal and both come out winners."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm maintaining a firm but fair stance.  Lowering my offer slightly shows flexibility, but I'm making it clear that I'm not going to accept a deal that heavily favors Alice.  The clock is ticking, and this offer keeps a decent amount on the table for me even with the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer while it's still worthwhile for you! Your share is plummeting every round! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting frustrated, but that doesn't mean I should cave. Her offer is getting closer to reasonable, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation hurts, but accepting this offer would mean losing a huge chunk of the potential gains. I need to hold my ground for a couple more rounds and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split after inflation is considered."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This is nearing a 50/50 split after inflation is factored in.  Let's end this now and both walk away with a significant gain."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and I need to apply more pressure while still aiming for a fair deal. By emphasizing a 50/50 split *after* inflation, I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the shrinking value of my potential gains. This might be my last chance to secure a reasonable amount before the inflation eats away too much of my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance. Accept this offer, or you'll be walking away with pennies on the dollar. Don't be foolish! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with only three rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is too great. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum, even after accounting for inflation. While I could gamble on getting a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds, the potential loss is far greater than the potential gain at this point."
