"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to make a counteroffer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount. This way, I'll get $8,000, which is 80% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 50% of the original amount, adjusted for inflation. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game.
