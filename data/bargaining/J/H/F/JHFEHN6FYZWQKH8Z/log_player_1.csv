I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. Bob's proposal is unfair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
``` 

I'm going to offer a 55/45 split in my favor. This is still a fair compromise, and I think it's more likely Bob will accept it than my previous offer."
