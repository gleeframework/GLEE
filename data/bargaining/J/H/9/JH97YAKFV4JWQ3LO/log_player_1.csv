"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob will get 20% or $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's see if you like it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll gain:

My gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000 (10% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000 (5% less due to inflation)

Considering the offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
