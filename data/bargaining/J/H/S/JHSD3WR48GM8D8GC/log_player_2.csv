"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront so we both benefit from avoiding inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not fair that Alice gets 6000 while I only get 4000, especially since the money will be worth less in the future. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the inflation eating into our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking on more risk with the inflation. This offer still gets us both a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the first one, I'm still losing out significantly compared to Alice. I'm going to try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your concern about inflation, but I believe we can find a more balanced solution. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  We're running out of time, and this deal still gives us both a good chunk before inflation eats away more. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I appreciate Alice's attempt to compromise, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm losing a significant amount of money compared to Alice, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I need to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the end, and the value of our money is decreasing rapidly. Let's agree on a deal where I get a slightly larger share. This way, we both get something before the inflation completely diminishes our potential gains. I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to be a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time and this is the best you'll get considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice, but with the inflation eating away at our gains so quickly, I need to secure something before it's too late. While I'm still not happy with the disparity, I'll accept Alice's offer."
