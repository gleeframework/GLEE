Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more even split, but I'll need a little more to make it worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI rejected Bob's offer. The offer of $450,000 for me is not enough, especially considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3. I'll make a new offer for dividing the money, taking into account the current worth after inflation."
