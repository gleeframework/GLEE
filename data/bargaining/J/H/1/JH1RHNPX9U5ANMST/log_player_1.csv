Although not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting.  Delaying further significantly risks ending up with nothing. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round makes the impact of inflation more severe for you. Even if you manage to get a slightly better offer in the next round or two, the value might be less than what you're being offered now due to the rapid devaluation.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems firm on his offer, and there's no guarantee he'll budge further even if you reject this.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but sometimes a compromise, even if not perfectly fair, is the best strategic move in a negotiation against a ticking clock."
