"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but still gives Bob a small share. This is to encourage him to accept, as he still gets something. I'm hoping he'll be willing to take a small gain rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer gives me $60, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, but still a decent amount of money.  Considering the inflation, and the fact that I'm likely to get less in future rounds, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy."
