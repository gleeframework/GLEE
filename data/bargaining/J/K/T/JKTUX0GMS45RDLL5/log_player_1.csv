"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept it. I'm willing to give up a decent amount in the hopes that he won't want to risk the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point. Inflation will only continue to hurt me, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better deal in the future."
