I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I think it's likely he'll accept in the first round, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the future. The inflation makes each round riskier, and a 50/50 split is a decent outcome."
