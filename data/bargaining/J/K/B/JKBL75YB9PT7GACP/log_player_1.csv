"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a classic example of a game theory problem with asymmetric information.  I'm taking a gamble by offering a seemingly unfair split, but I'm hoping Bob doesn't know about the inflation that will decrease the value of his share. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a better share, the inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting this offer means I get $10, which is worth less than what I initially offered Bob, but it's better than getting nothing in the next round due to further inflation.  

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
