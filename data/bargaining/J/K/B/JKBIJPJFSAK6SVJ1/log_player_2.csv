Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 80/20 split is fair, considering the inflation affecting you more. Let's get this done before things get worse! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, this inflation is eating us both alive, even if it's just me feeling it right now.  I'm offering a 55/45 split.  It's closer to the middle, and it means we both walk away with something substantial.""}
