"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair share, considering the inflation penalty he'll incur if he rejects the offer and the game continues. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering the next round will reduce the value of the money for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I don't have to worry about inflation. On the other hand, Bob will face an even bigger inflation penalty in the next round, which puts pressure on him to make a better offer or accept a worse deal. I'll wait and see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is working against you, let's settle now!""}\n\n

Since Bob's offer in the previous round wasn't satisfactory, I'm increasing my share in this round. I'm taking advantage of the fact that Bob will face an even bigger inflation penalty if he rejects this offer, which puts pressure on him to accept a less favorable deal. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
