"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself the larger share.  This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I believe it's a good starting point considering the inflation rates and the fact that I have the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob could have offered me nothing in this round. Accepting ensures I get something, and while it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a decent amount."
