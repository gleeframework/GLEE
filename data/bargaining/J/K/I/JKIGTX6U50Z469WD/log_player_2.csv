Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means getting significantly less, even if a better offer arises.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message implies she won't budge further. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with nothing if she's serious.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. A deal needs to be struck soon.

Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, even if it's slightly less than desired.  Refusing risks a worse outcome, especially considering the dwindling value and time remaining."
