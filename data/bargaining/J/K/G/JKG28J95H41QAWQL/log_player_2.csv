Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round is costing you more, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer might seem tempting as the rounds progress, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is a losing strategy. There's still time to negotiate a better deal, and the threat of walking away with nothing might push Alice to be fairer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a compromise - a slight advantage for you, but we both secure a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 405000 
# Alice gain: 595000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely impacting my gains, and Alice is unlikely to agree to a deal where she receives less than $500,000. Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount, even if it's significantly less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. Waiting any longer runs the risk of getting even less, or nothing at all."
