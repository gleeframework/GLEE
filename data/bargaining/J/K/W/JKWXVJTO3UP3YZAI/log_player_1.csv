Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is fair given that I'm taking the risk of rejection and the potential loss from inflation. Let's make this quick and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
