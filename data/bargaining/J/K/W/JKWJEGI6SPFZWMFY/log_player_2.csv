Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it more evenly this time. I'll take $4500, and you can have $5500. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the deal.  It's better than nothing, and it's close to the split I was hoping for."
