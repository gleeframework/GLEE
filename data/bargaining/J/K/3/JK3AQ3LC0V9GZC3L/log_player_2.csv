Alice is using the threat of inflation against me, but I still have time and she's not offering a fair deal. I need to push for a more significant share before the value diminishes further."

Alice is definitely using inflation to her advantage, but I can't accept a deal this low. I need to make it clear that I'm willing to risk it all to get a better share."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds left, the value of the deal is diminishing rapidly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if Alice offers me a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the impact of inflation will mean the actual gain is minimal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a 50/50 split or better is highly unlikely at this point. I'd rather take a less-than-ideal share than risk getting nothing at all."
