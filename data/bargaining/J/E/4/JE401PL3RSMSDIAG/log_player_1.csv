"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem like a fair split given our different future values due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to my lower future value. This 60:40 split is a fair start, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
