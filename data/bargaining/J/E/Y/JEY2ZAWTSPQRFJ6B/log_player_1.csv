"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives me a significant advantage, but leaves Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal in the first round, avoiding any potential inflation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I understand the value of my potential gain is less due to inflation, I am not willing to accept a 10/90 split in Bob's favor.  This is a significant reversal of the initial offer, and I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. While the inflation is impacting my potential gains, I believe this offer is still a fair compromise, considering the dynamic nature of the negotiation.  I hope this will incentivize Bob to accept and end the game before further inflation erodes the value of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I am aware of the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I am not willing to accept such a drastic shift in the division, with Bob gaining 80% and me only 20%.  I believe I can still negotiate a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. While I recognize the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains, I believe this offer is still a reasonable compromise, especially considering the previous rounds. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as the value of the money continues to decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is significantly impacting the potential gains, I am still not willing to accept such a disadvantageous offer where I would receive only 30% of the money while Bob gets 70%. I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome before the inflation erodes the value of the money even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the inflation is taking a toll, I believe this offer is still a good compromise and reflects the fact that I've been making concessions throughout the negotiation. I hope this will finally convince Bob to accept, as the money will continue to decrease in value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, I am still not willing to accept a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. I believe that we can still negotiate a more equitable division, and I am hoping to achieve a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  With the inflation severely impacting the value of the money, I think it's time to compromise.  A 50/50 split is a fair and equitable solution, considering the circumstances."
