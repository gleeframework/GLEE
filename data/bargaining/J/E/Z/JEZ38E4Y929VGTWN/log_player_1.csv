"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a good deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the future. Even with the inflation, my gains will be greater if I reject and make the proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly due to inflation, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Even though the inflation is hitting hard, I believe I can get a better deal if I keep playing. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

With the inflation factor becoming more significant, I'm offering a compromise. While I'd like to secure a larger portion, I'm prioritizing a deal in this round to avoid further losses."
