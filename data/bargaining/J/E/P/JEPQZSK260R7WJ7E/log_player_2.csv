"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob will likely reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. He knows the money will be worth less to him in the next round, so he'll want to try and get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. How about we split it 60/40?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The longer this takes, the less you'll get Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still less than ideal, the inflation is starting to significantly hurt Bob. It's likely better to accept this offer than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round."
