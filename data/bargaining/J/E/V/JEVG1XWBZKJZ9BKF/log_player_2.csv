# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with 40 dollars. I think I can do better than that. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens.\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation hurts us both, Bob, but time is money. I'm offering you a bit more than you offered me last round - let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. Even though the money is worth less now, I think I can still get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens. The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, so I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise.\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth, especially for you, Alice. Let's settle this now and minimize our losses.""}\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the sense in this offer and accept it. The inflation is really starting to hurt her, so I think she'll be more willing to compromise. Fingers crossed!"
