It's important to consider the overall value of the money Bob is gaining.

Round 20
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

Bob has been rejecting offers for a while now, and the inflation is making the money worth significantly less for him. He's likely to be feeling desperate at this point, but he's also learned that Alice is willing to reject even very favorable offers.  He needs to offer something close to what he's willing to accept, but still leaves room for Alice to see some benefit in accepting. This offer is a slight improvement for Alice from the previous round, giving her some incentive to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 20.

Round 21

Bob is in a tough spot. The inflation is making the money worth practically nothing for him, and Alice's offer is incredibly unfair.

Round 22
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

At this point, Bob is in a very precarious situation. The inflation is making the money worth practically nothing for him, and Alice is clearly willing to push for a very unfavorable deal. Bob has tried various approaches, but Alice has consistently rejected his proposals. This offer is close to what he's willing to accept, but it gives Alice a reasonable share, which might convince her to accept and end the game. There's a chance she might still reject, but waiting for a better offer is not feasible with inflation eroding the value of the money so drastically."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 22.

Round 23
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 90.15% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Bob is in a tough spot.  Even though the offer is almost nothing, the value of the money is diminishing rapidly with each round.  There's a slight chance that continuing to reject and holding out for a better offer in the next round could lead to a more favorable outcome. It's a risky move, but it's the only way to potentially salvage something from this situation."

Bob is in a desperate situation.  The inflation is making the money worth practically nothing for him.  While Alice has rejected several offers in the past, this offer is close to what he's willing to accept. He needs to secure a deal before the value of the money drops even further. Offering a slightly higher share to Alice might be the only way to end the game and salvage some value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 24.

Round 25

Bob is in a desperate situation. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money he's gaining.  He needs to secure a deal quickly before the value drops even further. This offer is very close to what he's willing to accept but still gives Alice some incentive to accept. Hopefully, Alice will finally agree to end this game."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is in a very difficult situation. Even though the offer is practically nothing, the value of the money is diminishing rapidly due to inflation. He has a choice to make: accept this offer and get a tiny amount of money or risk getting nothing at all by continuing to reject. However, there's a slim chance that Alice might be willing to accept a slightly better offer in the next round.  It's a risky gamble, but it's the only way to potentially salvage something from this situation."

Round 28

It's a difficult decision, but it's still worth rejecting.

```

At this point, the value of the money for Bob has decreased drastically. It's time to make a final push to secure a deal.  While Alice has rejected previous offers, this offer is still very favorable for her, considering the inflation and the possibility of the game continuing with even lower values for Bob's share. There is a good chance that Alice will finally accept to end the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 30.

Round 31
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 95.76% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

```

Bob is in a dire situation. The value of his potential gains is almost nonexistent due to inflation. This offer is a last-ditch effort to secure a deal before the value of the money decreases further. It's close to what he's willing to accept, but still provides Alice with a reasonable share.
