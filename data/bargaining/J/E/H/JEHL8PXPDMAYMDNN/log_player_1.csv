I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm assuming it's a big deal for him and he'll be more likely to accept a smaller share early on.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I still have a chance to get a better deal. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}

I'm offering Bob 2800.  Since I'm not sure how inflation is affecting him, I'm assuming he's feeling the pinch too.  He rejected my last offer, so I need to offer a bit more to make it worthwhile.  Hopefully, he'll take it!"
