"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

This way, I'll get a significant amount upfront, but still leave Bob with a decent chunk of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 80%, I'll try to negotiate from here 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate for the loss. However, I don't want to give away too much, considering Bob's initial offer was already 60% of the total.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the loss.

I'll offer a slightly lower amount than before, but still a significant portion of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% this time, but I'm not budging further""
}
```"
