"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to be a strong starting point.  I'm claiming the vast majority of the money, hoping Bob will accept to avoid risking the potential for inflation. However, it's not completely unreasonable for Bob, as he still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to reject. Bob's offer is extremely unfair and I'm not going to accept being given just $1.  Even though inflation is affecting Bob's offer, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly more balanced offer this time, giving Bob a slightly larger share. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept, as we are nearing the middle of the game and the risk of inflation is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very one-sided, even with the inflation factor.  I'm going to reject this offer. I believe I can still negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced offer this time, giving Bob a larger share. We are getting closer to the end of the game and the risk of inflation is increasing. It's likely Bob will be more willing to accept a deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided, even with inflation affecting his share. I'm confident I can negotiate a more equitable split in the next round.  The risk of inflation is increasing, but I'm not willing to give up nearly three-quarters of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split with 60% for Alice and 40% for Bob. We are getting closer to the end of the game and the risk of inflation is getting even higher. I hope this is enough to entice Bob to accept."
