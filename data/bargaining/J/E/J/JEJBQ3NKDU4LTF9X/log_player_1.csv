"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $4000 in this round is actually worth less than my initial share of $8000 in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my share of the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```"
