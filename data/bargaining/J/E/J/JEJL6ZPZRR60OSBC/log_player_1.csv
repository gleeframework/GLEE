  ""alice_gain"": 6250,
  ""bob_gain"": 3750,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split, giving me a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
