"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect Bob more heavily in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, even with the inflation.  It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing in the future."
