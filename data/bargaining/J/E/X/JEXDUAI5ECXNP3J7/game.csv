30.0,70.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was ridiculous, but so is this one. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. It reflects the fact that I'm more negatively impacted by the inflation in this game.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but this offer is still too lopsided.  Let's compromise. I propose a 55/45 split, which is closer to a fair share after considering the inflation. This gives you a decent portion while acknowledging the larger impact on me.",Alice,3,
