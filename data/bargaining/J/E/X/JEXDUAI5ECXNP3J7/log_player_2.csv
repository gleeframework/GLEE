"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with me taking 90% and you taking 10%. This way, we both get a good share of the money. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a highly unfair offer! While it might seem tempting to take $10 now, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal.  The value of the money will decrease over time, but not nearly enough to justify accepting such a low amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was ridiculous, but so is this one. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. It reflects the fact that I'm more negatively impacted by the inflation in this game.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but this offer is still too lopsided.  Let's compromise. I propose a 55/45 split, which is closer to a fair share after considering the inflation. This gives you a decent portion while acknowledging the larger impact on me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now much more reasonable. Taking inflation into account, getting 45% now is better than risking getting a smaller percentage later. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush, especially when those bushes are experiencing rapid inflation!"
