Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. My previous offer was ridiculous, but so is this one. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. It reflects the fact that I'm more negatively impacted by the inflation in this game.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but this offer is still too lopsided.  Let's compromise. I propose a 55/45 split, which is closer to a fair share after considering the inflation. This gives you a decent portion while acknowledging the larger impact on me.""}
