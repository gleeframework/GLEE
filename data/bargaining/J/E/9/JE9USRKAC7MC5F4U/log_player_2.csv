Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40, I'm the one making the first offer after all!

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55-45 split is more fair, as we're both taking turns proposing.  What do you think?""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you think 55-45 is fair, but I still think I deserve a bit more for making the first offer. How about we meet in the middle at 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Let's take what we can get!"
