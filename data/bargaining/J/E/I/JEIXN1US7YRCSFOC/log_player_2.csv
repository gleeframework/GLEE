"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. How about we split it 60/40 in my favor? I'm willing to negotiate further if you have any other ideas.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. How about we meet in the middle at 50/50? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, I think a 50/50 split is fair.  I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
