"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it ensures I get the majority of the money while still giving Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose a 850,000 - 150,000 split.  I'm willing to lower my share slightly, but I still want to secure a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a higher share.  Bob's offer is getting lower each round, so I believe I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I believe a 800,000 - 200,000 split is still fair, given that Bob's money is losing value rapidly due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is becoming more enticing as his share is losing value, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if we keep playing. I'll continue to try and maximize my share while recognizing that inflation is impacting Bob's side of the bargain significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 750,000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. With inflation hitting him hard,  a 250,000 share is likely looking better for him than a potential lower offer in the next round."
