"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer suggests a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty aggressive offer from Bob!

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money, so I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more in my favor. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You took 60% last round, I'll meet you in the middle this time.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the 40% I offered, but I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out! This offer is even more unfavorable than the last one, with me getting only 30% of the money.

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was 70-30 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's even closer to a 50-50 split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

This offer gives me a bit more than 40% of the money, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate."
