"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving some room for negotiation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth $2700 (90% of $3000).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I was hoping for a more even split. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
