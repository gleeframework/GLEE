"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose and have the advantage in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and inflation is impacting him more severely, a 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is not ideal, Bob's offer is much more favorable to him than the 50/50 split I offered in the previous round.  The inflation is affecting Bob more significantly, and accepting this offer is the best way to avoid further losses."
