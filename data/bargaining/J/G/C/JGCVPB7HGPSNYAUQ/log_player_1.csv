"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. I've attached a message that says ""Let's split fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness in my proposal. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given that the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, accepting $400,000 now would be equivalent to accepting less value than I initially proposed for myself. I'll proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal, keeping in mind the impact of inflation on both our gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the impact of inflation on both our gains. Since the value of the money decreases more significantly for me (20% less each round) compared to Bob (5% less each round), I've adjusted my proposal to try and find a middle ground. I'm offering $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, hoping that this compromise, along with the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle,"" will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
