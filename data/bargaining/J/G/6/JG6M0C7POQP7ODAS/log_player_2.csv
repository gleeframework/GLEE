"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While an even split seems fair, there's no reason to accept it right away. We can try to get a better deal by seeing how Alice responds to a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  This takes into account the value of the money decreasing over time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, this offer is better than what I could potentially get in the next round. It's also a decent increase from Alice's initial offer."
