"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself, considering I have no information on Bob's risk tolerance or knowledge of the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, even though it was rejected. I will reject again, hoping that he might offer more next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation, but still aiming for a good share. I'm hoping Bob realizes that rejecting my offer won't necessarily get him a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Bob's offer is better than the previous rounds.  I'm not sure how many more rounds I can risk, so I'll take what I can get."
