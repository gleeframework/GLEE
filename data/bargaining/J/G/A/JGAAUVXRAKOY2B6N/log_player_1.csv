"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the money, leaving you with 40%. It's a fair start to the game!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70%, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob. So, I'll evaluate Bob's offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in the ""slightly better deal"" since it's still a significant difference in favor of Bob. I'd like to negotiate further to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you 45% of the money, but I'm still looking for a fair deal for myself.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob 45% of the money, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55%, but I'm getting closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's offer is getting more attractive. However, I still want to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's still biased towards Bob, even if it's slightly more generous than before. I'd like to see if I can get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 50/50, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
