"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a fair offer, splitting the money equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I need to get a larger share to feel comfortable.

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.
