I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. It's a significant reduction from the initial offer and Bob's proposal doesn't account for the fact that he's getting a greater share of the shrinking value of the money. I'm hoping to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise by increasing my share from the previous round but still giving Bob a substantial amount. I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation but still provides a reasonable outcome for both of us."
