"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given we both have to agree.  Let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For me, the effective gain would be 40 * 0.9 = 36 (since my gain is worth 10% less)
For Bob, the effective gain would be 60 * 0.95 = 57 (since his gain is worth 5% less)

Considering the adjusted values, I think a 60/40 split is actually quite reasonable. I accept the offer.
