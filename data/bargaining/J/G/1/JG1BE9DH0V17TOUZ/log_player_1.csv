"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm starting with a 4:1 ratio, offering Bob a relatively small share to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $950,000 to me.

I'm considering Bob's offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth $950,000 to me now, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value due to inflation. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $857,000 to me.

I'm considering Bob's offer, and it seems like he's trying to take advantage of my reduced offer from the previous round. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I decide to accept it.
