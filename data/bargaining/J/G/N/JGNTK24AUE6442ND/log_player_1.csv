"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact Bob more heavily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still far too low given the inflation rate. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable split considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than the previous round. While I'm getting significantly less than the initial $900,000, with the rate of inflation, it's a good deal for me."
