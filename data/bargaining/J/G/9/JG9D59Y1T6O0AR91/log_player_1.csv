"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you $100,000 to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount to start, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, let's stop here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round!

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
