"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal. I take most of the money, but you get something too! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, the game has just started. Bob should hold out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""
}
``` 

This offer is a strong starting point for Bob. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** It's a more equitable division of the money, reflecting that they are both equal players in this game.
* **Time Pressure:**  Alice knows the value of the money decreases for Bob each round. Offering a significant sum right away might entice her to accept rather than risk getting a smaller amount later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a more balanced split, and it gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against Bob.  While 4000 is a significant amount, accepting now sets a bad precedent for future rounds. Bob needs to show he's willing to play tough."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Slight Concession:** Bob is reducing his demand slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing it as a ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency. Alice is now aware that Bob might be less flexible in subsequent rounds.
* **Inflation Factor:**  The clock is ticking, and Bob needs to secure a good deal before the inflation eats away too much of his potential gain."
