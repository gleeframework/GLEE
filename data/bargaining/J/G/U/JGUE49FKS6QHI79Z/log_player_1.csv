Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly greedy approach in the first round, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation is a significant factor. It's better to secure 80% of the current value than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
