"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see how the game goes from here."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll get $47.5 (30 * 0.95).
