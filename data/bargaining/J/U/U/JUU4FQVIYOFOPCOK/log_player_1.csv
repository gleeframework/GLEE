I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving Bob with a tiny bit to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair split and the inflation is starting to become a concern. Better to take the half now than risk losing it all."
