I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the initial offer. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While the initial offer was quite generous, I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with only 1000, especially when I know the money will be worth less in the next round.  I'm hoping we can come to a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  This is more in line with my initial offer, but acknowledges that Bob has some leverage now that he's rejected my previous proposal."
