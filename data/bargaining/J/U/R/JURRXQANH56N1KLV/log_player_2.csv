Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split. I'll take 95, you take 5. It's a good start, and we can negotiate further if needed.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting the money devalue further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 60, you take 40.  This is a more balanced split, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing for you.  My offer is now 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}
