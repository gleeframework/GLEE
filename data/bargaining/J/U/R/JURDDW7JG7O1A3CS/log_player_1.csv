"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money will depreciate faster than mine. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, and I know he's under more pressure from inflation. I'll reject his offer and see if he'll come back with a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to 55/45.  Since the money is worth less now for both of us, I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still need to make sure I get a decent share.  Let's see if Bob will accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a lower gain than my initial proposal, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is hitting Bob much harder, and he's likely to push for an even more uneven split in his favor if we go to another round.  I'd rather take what I can get at this point and avoid further losses."
