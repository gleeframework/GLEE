"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the money evenly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'll try to get more than half to make up for the loss. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to try to get a bit more than half. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll aim for 55$. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a split closer to even is more fair, considering the inflation on your side.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 9.75% less for me, I need to consider whether Alice's offer is good enough. Meeting in the middle at 48$ for me might not be the best option, considering the decreasing value. I'll try to hold out for a better offer in the next round.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, I'll make another offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since I've already lost about 10% of the value, I'll aim for a higher amount to compensate. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 57,
""alice_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on my end. I need a bit more to make up for the loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with an even split. We can't keep going back and forth, the inflation is only getting worse. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAt this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation (18.55% less), accepting an even split might be the most reasonable decision. The offers and counteroffers have not resulted in a significantly better deal for me, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money I receive. It's time to accept the offer and end the game before the inflation worsens.
