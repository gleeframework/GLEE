"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. I'm willing to give you a higher share if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of our potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I'm willing to meet him in the middle. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 4:6 split, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000. It's not ideal, but I'm hoping we can do better in future rounds!"
