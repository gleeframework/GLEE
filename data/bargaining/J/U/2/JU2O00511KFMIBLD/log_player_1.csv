Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It reflects the slight advantage I have due to the faster inflation rate on your side. Let's make this quick and get the money! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
