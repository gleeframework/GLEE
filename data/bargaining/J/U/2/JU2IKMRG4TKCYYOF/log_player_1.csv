"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so the effective value of my gain in this round is 4800 (60% of 8000, which is 20% less than 10,000).

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
