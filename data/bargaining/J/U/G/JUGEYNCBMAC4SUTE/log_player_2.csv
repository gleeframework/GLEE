**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but time is working in her favor more than mine. I need to push for a better split soon, or I risk getting even less later."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to do this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for an even split as a last-ditch effort.  Alice might be holding out for more, but the longer this goes on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split, even with the reduced value, is better than nothing."
