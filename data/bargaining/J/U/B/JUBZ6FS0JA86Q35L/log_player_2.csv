Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** Even though the offer is slightly better for Alice than the first round, the inflation significantly affects her. Her share is now worth 19% less, making the deal more favorable for Bob.
* **Potential Future Rounds:** While Bob could try to push for a larger share, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a further offer. This offer is a good compromise, giving Bob a decent amount while minimizing risk."
