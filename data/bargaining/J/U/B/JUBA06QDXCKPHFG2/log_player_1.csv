"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think you're being too optimistic about inflation. I'll give you a bigger share, but I need a bigger share too. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
