"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 50/50. I'm willing to give you 40% of the pot, but I'll need the rest to account for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'd like to try to negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for you, I think. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need a bit more for myself to account for the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
