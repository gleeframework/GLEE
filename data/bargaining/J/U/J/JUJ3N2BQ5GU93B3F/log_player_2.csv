Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced split, understanding that inflation hurts you more than me.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, you drive a hard bargain!  Let's settle this now - I'll accept a slight reduction from my original offer.  This is better than risking further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
