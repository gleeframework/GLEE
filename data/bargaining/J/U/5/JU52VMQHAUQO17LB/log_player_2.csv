"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair initially, considering the inflation impact,  I will reject it. I can potentially get a better deal for myself in the following rounds.  The inflation will affect Alice's offer more heavily than mine, and I'll have the advantage of making the proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money 60/40 in my favor. Inflation will affect your share more than mine, so it's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I've adjusted the offer. This is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still not as favorable as I believe I can get. While I acknowledge the impact of inflation, I still have an advantage in the next round with the power to make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm willing to give you a chance to get some money. This 70/30 split is fair, considering the impact of inflation on your share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a more even split. Inflation affects me more, so I need a bigger share upfront. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still not as favorable as I believe I can get. Even though inflation is hitting her harder, I believe I can push for a bigger share in the following rounds. The power to propose in the next round gives me an advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, but I'm offering a 75/25 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the current situation. We need to settle quickly to avoid losing more money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a more reasonable split. Let's settle before the money becomes worthless. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though the time is running out, I still believe I can get a better deal.  The inflation is affecting Alice's share much more than mine, and I can leverage that in the next round. I'm not willing to settle for this offer yet."
