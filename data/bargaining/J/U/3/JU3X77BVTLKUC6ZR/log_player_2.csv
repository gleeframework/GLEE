# Alice gain: 700000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer we wait, the less your share is worth. I'm offering you $350,000, which is still a good deal considering the inflation.  Don't let this opportunity slip away! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
