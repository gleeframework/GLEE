"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer is:

* My gain of $4000 is worth 80% of $4000, or $3200, in the first round's value.
* Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of $6000, or $5400, in the first round's value.

Since Bob's gain is still higher than mine, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
