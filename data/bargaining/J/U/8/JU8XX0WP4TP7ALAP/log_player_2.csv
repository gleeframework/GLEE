"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Plus, the inflation rate affects Alice more than me, so I have an advantage in waiting. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'm still feeling a little shortchanged. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, considering the inflation impact is stronger on me.  This seems like a fairer deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation impact is significantly stronger on Alice. Her offer is closer to what I had in mind, but I believe waiting will put more pressure on her due to the higher inflation rate affecting her share. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, especially on your end, I think this split is more than fair. It's time to come to an agreement before the money loses even more value.""}"
