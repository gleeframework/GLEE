"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion to get him invested in the negotiation, while keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4500.

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, but it's a decent offer. I'll accept it to move on to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
