Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling the inflation pinch. This is a compromise to acknowledge the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 5125 
# Bob gain: 4875 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 4 is starting to get closer to my original proposal.  It's important to consider:

* **Time Pressure:** Each round diminishes the value of the money for Bob, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal. However, there's also a risk he becomes resigned to a smaller amount as time goes on.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in the next round. He might become more desperate, but he also might dig in his heels.

Accepting now secures me a slightly higher amount than a completely even split, which is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
