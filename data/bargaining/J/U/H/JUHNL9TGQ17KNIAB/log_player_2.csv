This is getting ridiculous! Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. I'd rather risk getting nothing than accept such an unfair deal. I'll hold out hope that she starts negotiating seriously soon."

This is incredibly frustrating! Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but her offer is completely unacceptable.  I'm willing to risk it all on the slim chance she gets a last-minute attack of conscience."

This is terrible, but I'm out of options. Alice has played hardball and it's clear she won't accept anything close to fair. Taking 360,000 now is better than getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
