"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. I think it's a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it almost equally. I think this is a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""It's getting less valuable, let's split it 50/50""
}


I'm offering an equal split, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair offer."
