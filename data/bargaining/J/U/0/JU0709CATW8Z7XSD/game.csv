6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for you in the first round. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I think 60/40 is a bit too much in your favor. How about we do 55/45? It's a more even split, and we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Plus, remember that the money is worth 10% less with each passing round, so let's not drag this out too long!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, I appreciate your previous offer, but I need a bit more security. How about 57/43?  It's a slight adjustment in my favor, but considering the inflation, it's important we settle this soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I see you're trying to adjust for inflation, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet in the middle at 52/48? It's a fair split, and we should consider the decreasing value of the money. Let's settle this before it's too late!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, I'm willing to move closer to a middle ground, but 52/48 is still cutting it too close for me. How about 53/47?  It acknowledges your point about the declining value and offers a decent compromise.  We need to decide quickly!",Alice,5,
