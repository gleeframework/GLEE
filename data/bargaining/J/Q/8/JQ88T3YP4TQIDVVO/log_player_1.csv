"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and kept $600,000 for myself, with the reasoning that I'm willing to take a bit more but still want to be somewhat fair. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time. I think it's only fair.  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. Considering this, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a compromise, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round due to inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the circumstances""}\n\n###\n\n Hopefully, Bob will consider the effects of inflation and accept this offer. Fingers crossed!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going lower than this.  Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's offer of $450,000 in this round is actually equivalent to approximately $327,900 in the first round. Given that the value of the money continues to decrease for me and Bob seems unwilling to compromise further, I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not thrilled about it, but it's better than risking an even worse deal in the next round!"
