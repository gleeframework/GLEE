7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while acknowledging the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly this time.  It's in both our best interest to avoid the diminishing returns of the next rounds.,Bob,2,
