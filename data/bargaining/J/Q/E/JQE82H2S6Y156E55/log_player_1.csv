I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This way, I get a substantial portion of the money, and Bob still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose that I receive $850,000 and Bob receives $150,000.  I'm willing to give up some of my potential earnings from the previous round to try and get the deal done. This offer still gives me a significant portion of the money while offering Bob a reasonable increase from his previous offer."
