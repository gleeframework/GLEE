"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer. Considering the inflation rates, I'll calculate the effective gains:

My gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38
Bob's gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'll reject the offer since I'd rather have a higher share. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}"
