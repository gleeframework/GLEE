"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more balanced split.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think 55/45 is a balanced split in my favor, considering the initial amount is $100.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 48, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
