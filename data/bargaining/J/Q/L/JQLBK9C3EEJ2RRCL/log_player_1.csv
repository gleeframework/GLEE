"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. This is a generous offer for Bob, given that I'm risking less in the first round.  I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer, as the money will only decrease in value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round's, it still feels unfair. It is worth considering that his offer is only 5% less than his original offer.  I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000 to 400,000 split.  This is a more balanced offer than Bob's last proposal, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's significantly less than my initial proposal, the value of the money is dropping rapidly, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
