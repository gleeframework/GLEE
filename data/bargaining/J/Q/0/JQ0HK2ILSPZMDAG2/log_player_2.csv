"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split almost evenly, Bob.  I get slightly more to account for the risk of you lowballing me in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take my chances in the next round. The 20,000 difference isn't enough to convince me to accept this offer, especially considering the relatively low risk of lowballing in future rounds. I'm willing to take a chance to get a better deal, even with the threat of inflation. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the risk of future inflation and lowballing is now on your side, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get.  I propose a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice is now offering an even split, I think it's time to accept the offer. The risk of future lowballing and the decreasing value of the money make it less likely that I'll get a better deal in the next rounds. An even split seems fair, and I'm willing to take the 500,000 dollars (although it's now worth 36% less than initially). Time to end the game and take the money!"
