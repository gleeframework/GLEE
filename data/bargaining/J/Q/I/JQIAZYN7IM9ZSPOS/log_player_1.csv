I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can both get a decent share of the money.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to keep more, it's clear Bob is not going to be as generous as I was in the first round.  It's better to take the 500,000 now before inflation eats away at my potential gains further."
