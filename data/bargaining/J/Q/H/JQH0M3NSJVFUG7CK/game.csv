7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also securing a significant portion for myself.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm willing to compromise on a 60/40 split. It's a fair offer considering the initial amount is already reduced by 10% due to inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
