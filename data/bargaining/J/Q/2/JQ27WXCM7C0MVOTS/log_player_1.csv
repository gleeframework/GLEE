"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I think this is a fair starting offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a fair split would be 400,000 for me and 600,000 for you. Let's work together to avoid inflation issues. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's proposal is a bit more generous than I expected, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is getting worse, and the money is worth 40% less than in the first round! I need to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Don't expect it to get any better!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a split of 350,000 for me and 650,000 for you. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's proposal is a good one, considering the inflation. It's a reasonable split, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and getting even less.
