**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting a worse deal later. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. This makes it increasingly difficult to get him to accept an offer where he gets significantly less than half.
* **Time:**  With each round, the potential gains shrink. Holding out for a better offer carries the risk of getting nothing if no agreement is reached.
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share of the money."
