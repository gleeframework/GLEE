Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is running out for both of us, especially you. This is a good deal considering. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. We're both losing money, but I'm going to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
