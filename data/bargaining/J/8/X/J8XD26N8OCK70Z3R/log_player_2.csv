Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I think we can both agree that this is a more fair way to divide the money, especially since it's worth less to me now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
