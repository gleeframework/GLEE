This offer is a starting point. I am aiming for a larger share, but I recognize that Bob will have more bargaining power in later rounds due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 880000, ""bob_gain"": 120000}
```

I'm raising my offer to try to secure a deal before the inflation hits too hard. While I am offering a larger portion to Bob, I still believe I am getting a fair share, considering the remaining inflation and my bargaining power in the next round."
