"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This offer is a straightforward 50/50 split, leaving no room for negotiation. It's a fair and simple proposal that should be easy for Bob to accept or reject."
