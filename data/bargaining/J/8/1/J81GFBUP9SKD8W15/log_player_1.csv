"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's split it 60/40 with me getting the bigger share. This way, we both get more than what was offered in the previous round, and we can avoid any further depreciation in value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
