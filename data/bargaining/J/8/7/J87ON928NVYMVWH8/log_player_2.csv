Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the time pressure, I think this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is already a significant compromise on my end. Let's split it evenly and avoid losing any more to inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the current situation, I think this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean getting the equivalent of  ~$12 (30% of the original $40 value after inflation).  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic. Holding out for a better offer or even a 50/50 split in the later rounds is still the better strategy, even with the shrinking pot from Bob's perspective."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I'm aiming for an even split from here on out. Don't be greedy.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the extreme devaluation of your share, I think this is a reasonable offer 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting very difficult. Accepting this deal means I get the equivalent of ~$10 because of the inflation. However, Alice is clearly exploiting the situation and offering terrible deals. There is a chance she panics in a later round and offers something more acceptable, even a 50/50 split is better at this point."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 50,

""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Accept a fair 50/50 split, or we both get nothing.  Stop being greedy.""
