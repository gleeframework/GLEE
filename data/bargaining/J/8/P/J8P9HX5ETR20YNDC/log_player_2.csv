"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  This is my first offer, so you can't do better. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a very unfair offer. While the money might not be worth much to Alice in the next round, it's still a lot for Bob. It's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split. Let's be fair, but also keep in mind the money will be worth less with each round. This is a good compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a larger share. Let's be reasonable, Bob.  We're both losing money with each round, and my losses are greater than yours. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Alice's offer is significantly better than the previous round and the money is losing value quickly. Accepting is the most sensible choice at this point."
