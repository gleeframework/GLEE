"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making things interesting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate for a bit more. However, Bob's offer is still a significant increase from the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential gains, I'll need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll aim to get a bigger share while still leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60/40 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
