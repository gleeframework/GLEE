"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. Even though it's a ""fair"" split in the first round, there's a good chance I can get a better deal later, especially since the value of money decreases for Alice at a slower rate than for me.  Let's see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a more favorable deal for me, considering the devaluation of money. Let's end the game here and avoid any further risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 55% of the original amount. Let's meet in the middle and finish the game. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I could potentially get a slightly better deal later, the inflation is getting significant, and it's risky to continue. It's better to secure this offer and avoid the chance of ending up with nothing."
