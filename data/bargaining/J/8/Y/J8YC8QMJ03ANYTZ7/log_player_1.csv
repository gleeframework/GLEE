"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a more favorable deal for me, considering the devaluation of money. Let's end the game here and avoid any further risk. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance! Bob is trying to take advantage of the devaluation of money to get an even better deal. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than 55% of the original amount. Let's meet in the middle and finish the game.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split, but still trying to keep the majority of the money."
