"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to mirror my previous offer!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Let's see... If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 400,000 dollars, which is worth 95% of its original value due to the 5% inflation. That's 380,000 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
