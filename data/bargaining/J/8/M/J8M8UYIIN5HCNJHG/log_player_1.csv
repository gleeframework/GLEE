"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get the larger share this time. Let's be even! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

If Bob's offer is accepted, I would get $400,000, which is worth 95% of the original amount, considering the 5% inflation.

However, I'm not convinced that I should accept an offer that gives me less than I proposed initially, especially since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than the original amount. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of the original amount ($900,000) and Bob's gain is worth 81% of the original amount ($810,000).

Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 55% and you get 45%""
}
```"
