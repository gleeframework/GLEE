Alice is still trying to take a larger share, even though the value is decreasing. It's worth holding out a little longer to see if she'll offer a more even split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

It's getting risky now.  Alice might not be willing to go any lower, and the longer we wait, the less we both get."
