"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want something too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $70 is now worth 95% of the original $50, which is $47.50.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a significant portion of the money, but I'd rather accept this offer than risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
