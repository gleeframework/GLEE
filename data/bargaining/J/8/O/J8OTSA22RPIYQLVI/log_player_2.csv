Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid depreciation for her. I'm willing to gamble another round to see if I can get a more favorable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:**  The money is losing value quickly, especially for Alice.  While her offer is still tilted in her favor, another rejection could lead to an even worse offer on her part out of desperation.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point. Waiting longer is very risky as we get closer to getting nothing. 
* **Decent Offer:** 440,000 is still a significant sum, even with the inflation. Holding out for a significantly better deal is unlikely at this stage."
