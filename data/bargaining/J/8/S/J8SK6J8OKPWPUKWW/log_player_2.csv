Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation that affects Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation impacts us differently, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to 55/45, acknowledging the changing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice's proposed split of 45/55 in her favor doesn't take into enough account the significant impact of inflation on her side. The money is worth 36% less for her now compared to the first round, which means the actual value she's getting is much lower than the nominal amount suggests. Given this dynamic, I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gains, I'll make an offer that reflects this changing dynamic but still appears reasonable for both parties.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your side, I believe this split is more reflective of the current value we're both receiving.""}"
