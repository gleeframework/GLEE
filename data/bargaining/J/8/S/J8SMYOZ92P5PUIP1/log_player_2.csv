"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, keeping in mind your lower inflation rate. Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very uneven split, and there are 12 rounds to work with.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a generous share, but let's keep in mind the inflation rates. We both need to get a good deal here.  ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, Bob. But I think a more balanced split is possible. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much more balanced split, and while I would prefer more, accepting this means we both get something, and the inflation rates are starting to become more significant."
