"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'm the one who proposed the initial 50/50 split. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll take that into account in my new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still trying to keep the offer reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 48, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation and my proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's gain worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be more careful with my decision. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is decreasing rapidly, I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 48 is a reasonable share, considering the circumstances. I'd rather accept this offer and get something than risk waiting for a better deal that might not come."
