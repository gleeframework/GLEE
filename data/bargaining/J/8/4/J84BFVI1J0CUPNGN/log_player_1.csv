Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm taking a larger share to mitigate the potential loss.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  The inflation rate is significantly higher for Bob than it is for me, meaning his offer is a better deal than my proposal in Round 1 would have been after the inflation hit.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk losing even more in the next round."
