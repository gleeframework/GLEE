Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him half of the money, especially since it's worth less to him due to inflation. However, I don't want to reject it outright, so I'll try to negotiate further.
