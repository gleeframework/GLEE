"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to negotiate.""}\n\nI offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself. The message is an attempt to appear open to negotiation and fairness, while still trying to get the larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think a 55-45 split is more reflective of the game's dynamics.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressured to accept a worse deal than I initially proposed. Additionally, Bob's offer of a 55-45 split is closer to my initial proposal, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob's gains. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's split it 58-42.""}\n\nI offer Bob 42 dollars and keep 58 dollars for myself. The message acknowledges the inflation affecting Bob's gains and attempts to find a middle ground between our previous offers. By slightly reducing my share, I'm trying to appear more willing to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice.  I'm sticking to a split that reflects the decreasing value.  56-44, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth the same for me, Bob's offer is still not favorable, and the inflation affecting Bob's gains is becoming more significant. Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob is sticking to a split that reflects the decreasing value, I'll try to counter with an offer that takes into account the growing disparity in the value of the money for each of us. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure, but considering the significant decrease in value for you, I'll make a slight concession. 57-43 is my new offer.""}\n\nI offer Bob 43 dollars and keep 57 dollars for myself. The message acknowledges the growing disparity in the value of the money and makes a small concession to try to reach a mutually acceptable deal. By offering a slightly better split, I'm attempting to create a sense of progress in the negotiations and hoping Bob will be more willing to accept this offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is plummeting with every second.  58-42 is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Despite the growing urgency and the significant decrease in value for Bob, the offer is still not in my favor. Bob's message tries to emphasize the rapidly decreasing value, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob claims this is their final offer, I'll try to counter with an offer that takes into account the extreme disparity in the value of the money for each of us. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand the value is decreasing rapidly for you, but I've made concessions before. This is my final offer: 60-40. Take it or we both lose.""}\n\nI offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself, returning to my initial proposal. The message emphasizes that I've made concessions in previous rounds and frames this as my final offer. Given the extreme disparity in the value of the money, I'm betting that Bob will accept this deal rather than risk losing everything. Let's see how Bob responds!"
