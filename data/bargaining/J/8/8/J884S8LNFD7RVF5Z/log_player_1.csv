"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I think a 55-45 split is a bit too skewed towards Bob, considering the initial offer was already 60-40. However, I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 55-45 split, but I think I can do better. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
