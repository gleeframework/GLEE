"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is $100,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, you get 40%. That's a fair starting point for us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be careful. With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original amount. However, due to the 10% inflation, it's actually worth 36% of the original amount ($360,000).

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll have to consider it. Let me think for a moment...

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but don't expect more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, which is $300,000. I'm hoping this is more acceptable to him, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
