I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split now, I want to see if I can get a better deal later on, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair for me to take a larger share this round, given the potential inflation. Let's see what you think.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is offering a larger share this round, but inflation is making my gains less valuable. I'll take the sure thing and accept her offer."
