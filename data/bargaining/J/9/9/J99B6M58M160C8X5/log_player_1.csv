"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll take the lead""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, let's see what you think 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'll analyze the offer:

Alice gain: $6,000 (worth the same as in the first round)
Bob gain: $4,000 (worth 5% less than in the first round, which is $2,000)

Since I'm still getting a higher amount than Bob, I'll reject this offer and try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $7,000 and reducing Bob's gain to $3,000, trying to find a balance between getting a good share and keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

I'll analyze the offer:

Alice gain: $5,000 (worth the same as in the first round)
Bob gain: $5,000 (worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is approximately $2,130)

Considering that Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I think this is a relatively fair offer. I'm getting a higher amount than Bob, but not by as much as in previous rounds. I'll accept this offer.
