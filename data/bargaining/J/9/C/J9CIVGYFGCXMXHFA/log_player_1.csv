"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you $1000 and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself, with the message ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you $1000 and take the rest."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my gains.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3000 and keeping $7000 for myself, with the message ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet in the middle."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair compromise, and I'd rather not risk going into another round with even lower gains. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
