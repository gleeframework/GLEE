"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, the $100,000 I gain is equivalent to $80,000 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount compared to what I could have gotten in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation. Since I want to maximize my gain, I'll aim to get as much as possible while still being willing to accept the offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get $800,000, which is equivalent to $640,000 in the first round, and Bob will get $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, $200,000 would have been a relatively small share, but now it's a significant portion of the remaining amount.

Considering the inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.
