6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth something. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't in my best interest. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  We can both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases significantly each round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's better than what we'll have next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Alice, time is running out.  I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This is a fair deal considering the depreciation and gives us both a reasonable share.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable. Let's settle this now. I'm offering you 4900, which is a good deal considering the inflation.  If we wait any longer, it'll be even less for both of us.",Alice,5,
