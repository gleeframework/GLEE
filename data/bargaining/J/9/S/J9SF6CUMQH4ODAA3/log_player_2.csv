"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth something. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't in my best interest. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  We can both walk away with a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases significantly each round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's better than what we'll have next round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the money is losing value, Alice is getting increasingly desperate. Her offer has swung closer to a 50/50 split. By rejecting this round, I put myself in the position to propose a deal in my favor in Round 4 and it's likely Alice will be more open to accepting a less favorable deal as the game progresses."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out.  I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This is a fair deal considering the depreciation and gives us both a reasonable share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable. Let's settle this now. I'm offering you 4900, which is a good deal considering the inflation.  If we wait any longer, it'll be even less for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a close call, but the risk of Alice's offer dropping further is outweighed by the potential loss in value. Accepting a near 50/50 split at this stage ensures I walk away with a reasonable amount. Delaying further could result in an even smaller gain for me."
