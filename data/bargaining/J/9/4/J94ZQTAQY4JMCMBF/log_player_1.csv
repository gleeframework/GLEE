I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount to ensure I get the most of the money.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob is offering a fair split, and while I'd prefer more, I'm sure that if I reject this offer,  the next round won't be as favorable."
