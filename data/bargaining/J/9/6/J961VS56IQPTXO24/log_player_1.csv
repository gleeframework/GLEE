"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose Alice gets 900,000 dollars and Bob gets 100,000 dollars.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still offering Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this offer is still significantly better than what I would get if we were to continue and the money devalued further. It's time to take the win!"
