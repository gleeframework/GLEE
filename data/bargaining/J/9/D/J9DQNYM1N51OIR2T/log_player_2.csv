**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to take a larger share. While her offers are getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is running out.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal. It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll become more agreeable in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option. Let's not throw away any more money.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking and Alice needs to understand the severity of the situation.  Offering a 50/50 split is a strong signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but not willing to be taken advantage of. This offer is fair and gives us both the best possible outcome at this stage.  Hopefully, she sees the value in accepting a sure thing rather than risking it all for a slightly larger slice of a rapidly shrinking pie."
