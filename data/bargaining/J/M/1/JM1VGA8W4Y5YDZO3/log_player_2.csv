"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to go for the initial offer, but since I'm Bob, the inflation rate favors me more. I'll try to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's find a middle ground. This offer is closer to your split, but still benefits me given the faster inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take a toll.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
