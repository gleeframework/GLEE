Let's see what I can get!  I'm sure I can do better than that."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try for a more even split, hopefully Alice sees the value in that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the money is worth less, this is a much better offer than my previous one, and it's getting late.  Let's take the win!"
