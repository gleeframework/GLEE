I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting half the money, and while the inflation affects Bob, it doesn't affect me in this round. It's better to take the sure thing than risk it with another round."
