"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not interested in giving you 60. I'll propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'll make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving away too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get more!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 55. I'll make a new proposal.""
}
```

I'll make a new proposal for Round 5.

Also, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the inflation rate - it's increasing rapidly!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not too far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's close to my initial proposal, but still gives Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not budging much. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being quite stubborn!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not going to give you 65. I'll make a new proposal.""
}
```

I'm starting to get a bit worried about the inflation rate - it's really eating away at the value of the money!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 49.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much either. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's as close to 50/50 as possible, but still gives me a slight edge due to the initial proposal."
