"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the majority of the money!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to reassess the offer. However, I'm not sure how much the inflation affects Bob, so I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate. However, I'll still offer Bob a decent amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take the majority of the money!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, I'll have to be very cautious. However, I'm not sure how much the inflation affects Bob, so I'll have to consider the offer carefully.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
