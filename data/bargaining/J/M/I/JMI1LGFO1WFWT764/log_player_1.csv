Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, taking 90% of the money.  This is to see if Bob is willing to accept a significantly unequal split in the first round.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm hoping to secure a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategic move. The inflation will continue to erode the value of my gains with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it guarantees me a significant amount of money without risking further losses due to inflation."
