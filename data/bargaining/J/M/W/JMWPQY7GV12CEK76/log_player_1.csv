"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small amount to try and get him to accept quickly. This is risky, as he might reject and then get a better deal in the next round, but I'm hoping to avoid too much inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even with the 20% inflation, getting 500,000 is better than risking more rounds and getting less.  It's a fair split for both of us."
