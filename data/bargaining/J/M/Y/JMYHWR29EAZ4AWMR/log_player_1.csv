"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $405,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth $522,500.

I'll reject this offer. The difference between our proposed gains is still too large, and I think I can do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced values due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000 and keeping $520,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $367,500, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is now worth $428,500.

I'll accept this offer. It seems like we're converging on a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with further reduced values.
