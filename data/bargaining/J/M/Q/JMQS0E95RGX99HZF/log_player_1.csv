"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures I get a large chunk of the money while leaving Bob with something, hopefully incentivizing him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a small amount now, I'm betting that Bob will be more willing to negotiate in the future as the inflation rate increases. By rejecting, I keep the power to make the next proposal and can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose a 80/20 split in my favor.  Since Bob rejected my first offer and the inflation rate is increasing, I'm lowering my share a bit but still maintaining a significant advantage. I hope this will make him more inclined to accept, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something now, I believe Bob is also feeling the pressure of inflation and his decreasing share. I am confident that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds, especially as the inflation rate increases further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 70% and increasing Bob's to 30%.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still confident that I can secure a good amount.  I hope this offer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation is significant, I believe Bob is feeling the pressure more than I am, as his share is decreasing at a faster rate. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds, especially as the inflation continues to increase."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm further lowering my share to 60% and increasing Bob's to 40%. The inflation is becoming a serious factor, but I'm still hopeful that Bob will recognize the value of a deal before we both lose everything.  I'm taking a calculated risk, but I believe this offer is still fair considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation is hurting, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation even more than I am, and I'm confident I can secure a larger share in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is reaching critical levels, so I'm proposing an even split.  While this isn't ideal, it's the best way to ensure we both get something.  I believe Bob will realize that rejecting this will lead to a much worse outcome for both of us, especially with only a few rounds remaining."
