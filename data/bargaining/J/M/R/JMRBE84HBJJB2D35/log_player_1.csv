"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's still a fair starting point.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share, or if he'll be more aggressive in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even with the 10% inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

This is a slight increase from my initial offer, but still gives me a strong advantage.  I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt Bob into accepting, before the inflation eats away at our winnings even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous proposals, even with the inflation.  I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round, where I will be the one making the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming to find a compromise. The inflation is getting serious, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.  Hopefully, this will convince Bob to accept before we lose too much more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the inflation is making the money worth significantly less. I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With the inflation getting worse, I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. This ensures we both get something before the money becomes worthless."
