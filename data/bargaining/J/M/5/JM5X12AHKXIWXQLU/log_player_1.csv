"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000 and keeping $8000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the value of money will decrease over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less than the initial offer, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to reassess the offer.

Considering the decreased value of money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
