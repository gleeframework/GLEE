"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get some money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll get $5,000 and Bob will get $5,000. It's a fair deal!"
