"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but at a cost to me. Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less for me due to inflation, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns, but I need to consider the impact of inflation on my gains. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll have to be careful about how I respond.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a 40-60 split, which is similar to my previous offer, but with a slightly better split for me. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can accept this offer.
