"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself. Since Bob doesn't experience inflation, I believe he'll be happy with a small share to get something right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much more reasonable. However, I will reject it and try to negotiate a better deal. Since inflation is working against me, I need to secure a larger portion of the money sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly but still aiming for a majority of the money. I believe this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Inflation is working against me, and the value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly.  It's better to secure 100,000 now than risk getting nothing at all."
