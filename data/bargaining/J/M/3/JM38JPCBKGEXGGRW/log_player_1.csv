"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 400k and take the rest. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to drive a hard bargain.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. This is my revised offer. Take it or leave it!""

I'm trying to drive the price back up a bit, but still keeping it relatively fair. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating away at Bob's offer!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```

# Bob's message: It's time to meet in the middle, Alice. This is a 50/50 split. Will you finally agree? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to drive the price back up again!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'll take it!"
