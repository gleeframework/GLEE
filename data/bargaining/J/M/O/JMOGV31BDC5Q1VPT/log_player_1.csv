Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the potential losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round's, I am still hopeful that I can get a better deal. Inflation will hurt me more than it will hurt Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll increase my offer slightly from the first round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before the next round of inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Inflation has hurt my potential earnings significantly.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid further losses."
