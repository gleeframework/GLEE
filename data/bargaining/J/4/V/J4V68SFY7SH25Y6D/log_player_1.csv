"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, a little more for me this time, but still a reasonable deal for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a good compromise. We both get a decent amount, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the deal is getting worse, I'm not desperate enough yet to accept a 40/60 split, even with the shrinking pot. I need to show him I'm willing to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be real. This is a better split for me, and you're still getting a good chunk. Time is ticking...""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing the pressure by reversing his previous offer and reminding him that time (and inflation) are working against both of us now.  I need to seem confident and willing to walk away, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer. Let's end this before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one. Bob is playing hardball, and this offer is terrible. However, I'm not convinced it's his *actual* final offer. He's likely trying to use the dwindling rounds to scare me into accepting a bad deal. I'll call his bluff, but I need to be prepared to concede significantly in the next round if he's serious."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, time is running out. Let's split this evenly and call it a day.  It's the fairest solution."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a calculated risk. I'm meeting Bob in the middle after he pulled out the ""final offer"" card. It's a significant drop from my previous offers, but still better than his 30/70 split. There's a good chance he'll take this to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the final rounds. By proposing a fair deal, I'm increasing the pressure on him to accept and avoiding a total loss."
