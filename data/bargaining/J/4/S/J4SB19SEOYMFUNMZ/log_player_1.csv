Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous this round. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  It's a fair deal considering inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. I need to push for a better deal before the money is worth significantly less."
