"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, he's offering me 400k, which is a bit less than I was hoping for. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
