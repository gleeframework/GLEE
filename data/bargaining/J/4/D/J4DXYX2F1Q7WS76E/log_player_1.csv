"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and fair split, and it's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a reasonable split, let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'm now looking at a gain of 900,000 * 0.95 = 855,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

With the money being worth 14.26% less, my gain is now worth 900,000 * 0.8526 = 769,074.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Let's just get it over with!"
