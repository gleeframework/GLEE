"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. I need to leverage this to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but I still want a fair share.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is negotiating, but the inflation is working in my favor.  I need to hold out for a better deal while being mindful of how many rounds are left."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
