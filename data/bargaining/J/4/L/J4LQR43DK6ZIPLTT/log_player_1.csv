"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 40%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took the lion's share in round 1, now it's my turn to be the king of the jungle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the reins!

I'm not convinced by his offer, though. I'd rather not give him 80% of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer and see if I can do better."

Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You want to be the king of the jungle? I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still want a fair deal.""
