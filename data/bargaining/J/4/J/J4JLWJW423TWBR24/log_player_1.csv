"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a generous and reasonable offer, considering the value of the money will decrease for me in subsequent rounds. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer is more advantageous for me, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to consider the decreased value when making my decision. However, I still think I can negotiate a more favorable split.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, my goal is to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate for the loss. I'm offering Bob 47.5% of the money, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys my intention to find a fair and acceptable solution for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's close this deal. I'm taking a tiny bit more to account for the ongoing inflation hitting your gains. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I believe this is the best deal I can get. The money is now worth 48.8% less for me, so I need to prioritize securing a reasonable amount before it loses even more value. Bob's offer seems fair, given the circumstances, and I don't think I can negotiate a better split at this point. It's time to close the deal!"
