"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90, you take 10.  We can adjust in later rounds if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We can both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering your last offer. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more,  a 60/40 split is reasonable considering inflation. Let's end this."
