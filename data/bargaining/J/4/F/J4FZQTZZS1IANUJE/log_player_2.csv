"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it evenly to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, I believe it's a fair proposal, and I don't see a reason to reject it and proceed to the next round. Accepting this offer ensures that I get 50 dollars, which is half of the total amount. Rejecting it and making a counteroffer in the next round carries the risk of ending up with less than 50 dollars if Alice decides to reject my proposal. Therefore, accepting the offer seems like the most rational decision in this scenario."
