"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can split the money now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both get a good amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Splitting it evenly might seem fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger hit each round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You said we should split it evenly last round, but I'm not getting any younger. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than this. Let's try a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

Wait a minute... I think I see an opportunity. With the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less, but Bob's gain is still relatively more valuable. I'll take a chance and reject this offer.

  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or walk away!""
