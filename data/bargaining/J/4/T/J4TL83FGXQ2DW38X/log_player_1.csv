"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take 999,000 dollars and give Bob 1,000 dollars. This way, I get the majority of the money while still giving him something. Since we have no information on Bob's inflation effect, it's a gamble, but it's likely he'll accept a small amount rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is less than what I was aiming for in the first round, it's still a significant amount, and the value of the remaining money is decreasing with each passing round.  It's a good deal to secure a large sum, even with the 10% loss due to inflation."
