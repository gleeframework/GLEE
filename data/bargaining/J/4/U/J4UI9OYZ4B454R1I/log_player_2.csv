**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential gains decreases.  While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds as the pressure on her intensifies."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a very generous offer considering the time pressure.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal now before we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my gain and recognizing the increasing pressure on Alice.  It offers her a slightly better deal than before while still securing a significant portion for me.  The message emphasizes the urgency and the fact that this is a strong offer under the circumstances."
