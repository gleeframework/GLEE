"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game now, or I'll make a new offer next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm trying to get the game started and see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money fairly. Let's end this now and avoid any further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to balance the power of inflation. Will you accept this offer?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more even split, but still trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less for Bob now, so I'll try to take advantage of that. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share than I had in my previous offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 0% less for me and 37.1% less for Bob, I'll try to take a more aggressive stance. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and go for a larger share. Will you accept this offer?""
}
```

I'm trying to maximize my gains while Bob's share is worth less and less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and end this game before inflation completely destroys our potential gains.  It's the fairest solution at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate and wants to split it evenly. I'm not sure if I want to give him an equal share, but I also don't want to risk losing out on more money due to inflation. I'll accept this offer, but only because I think it's the best option at this point.
