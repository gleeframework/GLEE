I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob the remaining 10%. This leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, but it also ensures a decent starting point for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get the majority share. I'm lowering my offer from 90 to 60, hoping to reach an agreement."
