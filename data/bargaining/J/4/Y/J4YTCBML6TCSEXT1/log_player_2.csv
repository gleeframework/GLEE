"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both have an equal chance of benefiting. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer. While an even split seems fair, I want to try and get a better deal for myself, especially considering the potential for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money a bit more in my favor, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round.  Let's see if you're agreeable to that.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division this time. It's fair and ensures both of us get a share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the inflation means I'm getting less than in the first round, an even split is a decent outcome considering the risk of getting nothing at all."
