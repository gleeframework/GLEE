Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my original offer. Let's split it 60/40. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose out due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, $4000 is actually worth 0.64 * $4000 = $2560 in the current round's value.
