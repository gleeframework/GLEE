"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can wrap up!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a 60-40 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, considering we're starting with $100. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but you can give me more too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 70-30 split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a more balanced offer than Bob's previous one. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little more for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 14.26% less than the first round, my gain is worth significantly less.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 75-25 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I think I can negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob. 50-50 split is fair, considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining $100. With the rapid inflation, I think it's time to cut our losses and split the remaining value equally."
