"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This seems like a good starting point.  
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
It's strategically sound to reject the first offer, even if it seems relatively fair. This signals to Alice that I'm looking for a better deal and am willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's find a more balanced split, Alice. How about this?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I need a bit more than that to agree. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still in her favor. By rejecting, I signal I'm willing to wait for a more favorable deal as the pressure increases on her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and a 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the heat of inflation. A firm, fair offer now increases the chances of her accepting.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  A 50/50 split positions me as fair and avoids appearing overly greedy, which could push Alice to hold out for a better deal later (even if it's not in her best interest). 
* **Simplicity:**  A clean split is easy to agree on, reducing the risk of miscommunication or misunderstanding as we enter the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, but the inflation is working against me. Let's meet in the middle - this offer prevents us from losing too much value. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Dynamics:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. While her offer isn't a 50/50 split, it's close enough and acknowledges the impact of the decreasing value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is becoming riskier.  We're past the halfway point, and if Alice continues to reject my offers, we risk walking away with nothing. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** Getting $48 is a decent outcome at this stage. It's better than risking a total loss by aiming for a marginally better deal in the later, more uncertain rounds."
