Round 2

I'm going to offer Alice a much smaller share this time. It's risky, but I think I can get a better deal for myself."

Alice is still being very greedy. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar offer to last time, but with a slightly larger share for me.  I'm hoping that with the inflation affecting Alice more, she'll be more willing to accept something closer to a 4:1 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not good enough. I'll keep pushing for a better deal.  The inflation is hurting Alice more than me, so I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to keep pushing for a larger share, but I'm also going to try to make the offer more appealing to Alice by increasing her share slightly. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I need to secure a deal before the inflation hurts me too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to stick with my strategy of pushing for a larger share while offering a slightly increasing amount to Alice. The inflation is really starting to hurt her now, so I think I can get her to accept something closer to a 5:1 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is starting to really bite, so I need to make a deal. I'm going to offer Alice a slightly bigger share, but I'm still going to try to get a larger portion for myself. I think this is a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to continue pushing for a larger share, the inflation is becoming a serious threat. Accepting this offer, even though it's a 50/50 split, is the best way to ensure I get something.  We're both getting half the money, and we can both move on with something."
