"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I'd rather not accept the 30% gain for myself. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 16% of the original amount (80% of 20% of the original, if you follow the math). I'll aim to get a bit more than that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 52%, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gain!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 25% of the original amount. However, I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and 75% is a relatively good deal considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 75% gain and call it a day."
