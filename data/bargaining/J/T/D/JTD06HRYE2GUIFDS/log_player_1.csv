{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less in this round, I'll have to think about it.

I'll decide to...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split. Here's my offer:

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
