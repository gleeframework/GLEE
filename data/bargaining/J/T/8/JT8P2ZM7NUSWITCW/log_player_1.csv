"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can start with a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about whether 20$ is a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob will be worth more money than me.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a fair cut!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking control, you'll get a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! In Round 4, I'll have to be even more careful with my decision.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I'll gain due to inflation, I'll have to think twice before accepting Bob's offer. However, I don't want to risk losing out on even more money if I reject it.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
