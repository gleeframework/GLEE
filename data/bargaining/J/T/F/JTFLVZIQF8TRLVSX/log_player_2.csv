"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to secure a fair deal due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money will become worth less for Alice with each passing round. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I believe this split is fairer, considering the inflation affecting your share. Let's make a deal and avoid further losses."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressure I'm under, but your offer was too extreme. This offer is a compromise, and it's important we reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering a significantly larger share than what I proposed, and I'm not convinced her ""inflation pressure"" is as dire as she claims. I'll try again to push for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the money evenly and avoid any further losses due to inflation. It's a fair deal for both of us.""
