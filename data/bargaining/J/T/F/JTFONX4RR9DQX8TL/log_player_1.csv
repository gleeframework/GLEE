"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, let's start with a small difference. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'll be getting $40, but it's worth 5% less than the $50 I would have gotten in the first round, I'll actually be getting $38 in terms of real value.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. Since I want to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal, I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept the offer."
