{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's the fairest option, and with the inflation we've both been dealing with, it's the best way to avoid losing more money.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although the offer is very unfavorable, the inflation makes it a better option than rejecting and risking getting nothing in the final round."
