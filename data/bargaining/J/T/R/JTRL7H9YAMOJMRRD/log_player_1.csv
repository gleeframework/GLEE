"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 990,000$ and leave 10,000$ for Bob. It's a fair offer that gives him a chance to get something, while securing most of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 100,000$ is something, it's not worth accepting at this stage.  Bob's offer is a bit more balanced, but I can still push for a better deal with more rounds to play. I will reject this offer and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I will offer Bob 50,000$ and keep 950,000$ for myself.  I'm reducing my offer slightly, but it's still significantly more than what Bob offered me. I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also shows that I am confident in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more favorable for him, but it's still not a good deal for me. I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, but I'm still not desperate enough to accept this offer. I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob 150,000$. This is still a significant amount, but it reflects the increasing inflation and the fact that we are nearing the middle of the game. I'm confident that I can secure a good deal for myself, but I also need to be more realistic and consider Bob's needs to avoid reaching a point where we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I would consider fair, it's still not enough for me. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm determined to get a better share. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try to get a little closer to a 3/4 - 1/4 split.  This is a significant offer for Bob considering the inflation, and it still allows me to secure a comfortable majority of the money. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep in mind that I'm losing value with every round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I think it's the best option at this point.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I gain, and Bob's offer is a fair and even split.  I'm losing out on a big potential gain, but it's better to get something than risk ending up with nothing at all."
