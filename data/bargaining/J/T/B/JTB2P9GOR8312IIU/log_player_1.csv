"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get more if we work together. This offer is fair, and I believe it will be more beneficial for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain of $6,000 in this round is equivalent to $4,800 in the first round, which is less than my original offer of $8,000. I'm not convinced that this offer is more beneficial for me in the long run, and I'm not willing to accept a lower share. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not going to give up my majority stake. You'll have to do better than that if you want a bigger cut.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 90% of the remaining $10,000, and offering Bob only 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We are both losing money with each round, and I think this is a fair compromise. Let's end this game and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

Bob's gain in round 4 is $4,500, which is equivalent to $8,636.36 in the first round (since it's 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value).

My gain in round 4 is $5,500, which is equivalent to $5,500 in the first round.

Considering the equivalent values, my gain in this round is actually lower than my original offer of $8,000, and Bob's gain is higher than my original offer of $2,000.

I'm willing to accept this compromise to avoid further losses.
