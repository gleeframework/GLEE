"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
Bob's gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'll accept Bob's offer.
