"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it more evenly this time. Let's call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still need a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While a 55/45 split isn't ideal, the inflation makes taking this deal the best option for Bob.  Further rounds will only devalue the money further."
