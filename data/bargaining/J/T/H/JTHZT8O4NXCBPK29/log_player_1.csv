"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money closer to 60/40.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the inflation will start to affect your share in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure I want to give him 60% of the remaining money. Considering the inflation, my share of $40 is already worth less than it was in the first round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 40 is enough for me, considering the inflation. I'll think about it and make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking effect, my money is worth even less now. I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money evenly. It's the fairest deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which might be a good compromise given the circumstances."
