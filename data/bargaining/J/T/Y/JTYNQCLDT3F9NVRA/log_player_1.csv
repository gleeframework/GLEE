Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're taking on the inflation risk, but your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This offer recognizes that risk while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
