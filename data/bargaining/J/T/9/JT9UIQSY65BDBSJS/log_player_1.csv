"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split considering we're starting with a clean slate. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slight lead this round, but we can still split it more evenly later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I think it's too skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer doesn't seem to be heading in that direction. I'll pass and hope to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge this round, but I'm not giving up yet""}

I'm trying to make a more competitive offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still holding onto a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
