"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about the 75-25 split, and I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, trying to find a sweet spot that Bob might accept. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
