"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a fair offer considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the risk of inflation. Rejecting allows Bob to make the next proposal and potentially secure a more favorable split before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
