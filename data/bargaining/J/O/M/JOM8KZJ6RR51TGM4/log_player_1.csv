Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
Even though it's less than I hoped for, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Bob. This makes him more likely to accept a deal as time runs out. However, waiting any longer is too risky, as we both lose out if we don't reach an agreement.

* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting guarantees me $5,000. If I reject and we don't reach a deal in the remaining rounds, we both get nothing.

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob stating this is his final offer adds weight to his words. He's signaling a willingness to settle, and it's unlikely he'll offer anything better."
