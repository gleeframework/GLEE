"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the funds with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob, considering the risk and potential future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 3:1 ratio seems generous, it's important to remember the potential impact of inflation.  It's better to see what Alice is willing to offer after the first round of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This accounts for the inflation risk, and still gives you a significant share.""}
