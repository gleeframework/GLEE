Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of Bob's share has eroded by almost 60%. Waiting longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows time is on her side and is unlikely to make a significantly better offer.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $300,000 is much less than Bob hoped for, it's still a substantial sum. Rejecting this offer risks getting an even lower amount in the next round or even ending up with nothing if time runs out. 

Bob is better off taking the current offer to cut his losses."
