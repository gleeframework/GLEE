"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the total amount. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. A compromise is better than a one-sided deal.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a majority of the funds. Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'll give you a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Here's my response to Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me the same share as in the previous round. I'm hoping for a better deal this time around!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving Bob an equal share of the funds. This should be a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"
