"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the value of the money I would gain in this round is 90% of $300,000, which is $270,000, and the value of the money Bob would gain is 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000.

I'd rather not accept this offer, as I would be getting less than I initially proposed in Round 1. My decision is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 90% of the money gained in the previous round, so I'll aim to gain more this round to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the value of the money I would gain in this round, I need to consider the inflation effect from the first round. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the value as follows:

 Initial gain: $600,000
 Inflation factor: 0.727 (1 - 0.271)
 Value of gain in this round: $600,000 x 0.727 = $437,000

Similarly, I'll calculate the value of Bob's gain in this round:

 Initial gain: $400,000
 Inflation factor: 0.516 (1 - 0.484)
 Value of Bob's gain in this round: $400,000 x 0.516 = $206,400

Considering these values, Bob's offer is:

# Alice gain: $450,000
# Bob gain: $550,000

I'll accept this offer, as it's better than the value I would gain in this round ($437,000). My decision is:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
