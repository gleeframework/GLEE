"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an interesting offer from Bob. I'd rather not give him a 3:1 ratio, but I'll consider it. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was heavily skewed in his favor, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to push for a 3:2 ratio again! I'd rather not give him a larger share than me, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to find a middle ground. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives me a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but still slightly favors himself. I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if it's the best option.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 499000,
  ""bob_gain"": 501000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still keeps the difference minimal."
