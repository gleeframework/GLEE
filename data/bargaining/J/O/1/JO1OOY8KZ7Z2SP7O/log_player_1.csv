"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm going to propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. It's a big chunk for Bob, but I figure it's a good starting point, and I'll be able to keep more of the money if he rejects the offer and I get to make the proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 190,000 this time, while keeping 810,000 for myself.  This is still a fair amount for Bob, and since the money is losing value with each round, I need to be more aggressive with my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the value of my money has decreased significantly due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  If I reject, I risk Bob offering me even less in the next round.  It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing."
