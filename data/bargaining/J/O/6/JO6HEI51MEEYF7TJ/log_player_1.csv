I'm going to start with a very generous offer, giving Bob a small amount to see if he'll accept.  I figure I can get more in later rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy, I think I can do much better than this.  I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer a bit, but still keep a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to take this deal.  There's a lot of money at stake, and the inflation is making it worse for both of us with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse.  He's still being greedy. I'm going to make another proposal in the next round.  I'll try to be more flexible this time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit to try and meet Bob halfway. It seems like he wants a bigger share, but I still need to make sure I get a decent amount."
