# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90, and you can have 10.  We can adjust later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the money, especially since the value of the money decreases by 5% each round for me. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
