Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  It's still a good amount for you, and it reflects a bit more of the effort I'm putting in to making this work. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
