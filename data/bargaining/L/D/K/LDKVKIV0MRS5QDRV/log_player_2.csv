"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's see if we can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split.  This is a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to get the most out of the deal, but this is a fair compromise. I'll accept to avoid further inflation."
