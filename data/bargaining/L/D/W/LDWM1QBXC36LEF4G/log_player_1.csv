"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose that I get $999,000, and Bob gets $1,000.  This is a very lopsided offer, but I'm hoping that in the early rounds, Bob will be willing to accept anything to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is much more equitable, I'm still taking it. With inflation kicking in, it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
