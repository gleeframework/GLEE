Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, don't wait for inflation to get worse 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome.  Take it before inflation hurts us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While a 50/50 split was very fair, she's unlikely to offer that now. However, I need to balance getting a decent share with the risk of getting nothing if time runs out.  I'll hold out a little longer, but I might have to accept a slightly worse offer in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice.  Inflation is hurting my potential gain, and this split is still in your favor. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting desperate, but I'll only go down by 1 dollar 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is steadily eroding my potential gain. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a smaller share now than risk getting nothing if Alice continues to lowball me."
