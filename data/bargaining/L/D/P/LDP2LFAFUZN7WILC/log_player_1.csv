"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** While I want a larger share, I want to ensure Bob doesn't feel completely cheated from the start. This offer allows for a decent starting point for negotiations.
* **Inflation:**  I'm aware of the inflation rates, so I'm leaving room for potential compromise in future rounds.

**Proposal:**  I offer you 900,000 dollars and Bob gets 100,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my share has decreased due to inflation, Bob's share has decreased significantly more. 
* **Unfairness:** This offer is highly unbalanced and I believe I can secure a better deal with a counter-proposal.

**Response:** I reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Taking into account the inflation rates, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of money for both of us.
* **Negotiation:** While I am aiming for a higher share, this offer still provides a significant gain for Bob, which should incentivize him to accept and avoid further rounds where the value of the money will continue to drop. 

**Proposal:** I offer you 700,000 dollars and Bob gets 300,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The combined effect of inflation has significantly reduced the potential gains for both of us.
* **Unfairness:** While I acknowledge the value of money decreasing, Bob's offer is still too unbalanced. I believe I can achieve a fairer division with a counter-proposal, especially considering the significant decrease in the potential value of the money with each round.

**Response:** I reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** We're getting close to the end of the game, and the value of money is rapidly decreasing. I need to make a decisive offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
* **Compromise:** While I'm aiming for a larger share, I'm willing to offer a more balanced split. This reflects the diminishing value of the money and encourages a possible agreement. 

**Proposal:**  I offer you 600,000 dollars, and Bob gets 400,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The combined effect of inflation has significantly reduced the potential gains for both of us.
* **Unfairness:** Bob's offer is extremely unbalanced, and while I understand the value of the money is dropping, this offer is simply not justifiable. At this point, the decrease in the value of the money is significant enough that even a small increase in my share would be better than accepting this offer.

**Response:** I reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I need to make a final decisive offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
* **Negotiation:**  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely. Offering a slightly more balanced split than my previous offer might entice Bob to accept, especially considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money.

**Proposal:**  I offer you 550,000 dollars, and Bob gets 450,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of money is now significantly less than at the start.  
* **No Guarantee:** There's no guarantee that Bob will make a better offer in the next round, and the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money.
* **Small Gain:** Accepting this offer secures a small gain for me, which is better than risking further losses due to inflation.

**Response:**  I accept this offer."
