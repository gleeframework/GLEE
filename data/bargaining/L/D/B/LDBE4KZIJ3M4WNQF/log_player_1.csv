"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it ensures I receive a larger share as the proposer, while still being generous enough to potentially entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is now the proposer. Accepting this offer guarantees a sizable share and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the future."
