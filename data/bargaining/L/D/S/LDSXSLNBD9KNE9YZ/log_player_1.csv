"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a fair and straightforward proposal to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me only 40% of the total, while Bob gets 60%. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still aiming for a fair deal. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer because it's getting closer to a fair deal, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. Plus, the money is still worth a significant amount, and I'd rather have something than nothing!"
