I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a very small share to get something at all.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, I'll accept it.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all!"
