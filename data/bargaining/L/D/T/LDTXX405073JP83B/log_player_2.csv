"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm hoping we can work out a more even split later on. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept a small amount, 10$ isn't a lot to start with.  Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering a more even split this time.  We can work towards a mutually beneficial outcome if we keep negotiating.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bigger share than that.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation affecting Alice's share more than mine. I'll take it!"
