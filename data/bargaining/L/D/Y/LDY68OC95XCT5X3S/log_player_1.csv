"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
 I propose to take 90 dollars, and leave Bob with 10 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a much better offer than the previous one, I believe I can still do better with a bit more negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60 dollars, hoping Bob will find this more agreeable.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and I want to avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I've considered the potential of inflation and that each round reduces the value of the money for me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's getting increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers."
