"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. We have plenty of time to work out a better deal if you want. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It gives you a good starting point and still leaves plenty of room for negotiation if you're not satisfied.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. We're both losing value with each round, so let's just split the money evenly and move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and with inflation eroding our gains, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
