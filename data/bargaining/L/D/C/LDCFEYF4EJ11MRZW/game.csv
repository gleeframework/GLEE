6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. We have plenty of time to work out a better deal if you want.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It gives you a good starting point and still leaves plenty of room for negotiation if you're not satisfied.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. We're both losing value with each round, so let's just split the money evenly and move on.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
