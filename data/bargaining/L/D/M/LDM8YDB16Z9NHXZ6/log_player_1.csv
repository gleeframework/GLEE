"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. The message is to try to set a positive tone and give Bob a decent starting amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's start with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $60 is actually $60 * 0.8 = $48.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 60/40 split, with me getting $48 and Bob getting $40."
