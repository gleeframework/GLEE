"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm making a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my thinking. The $300,000 I'd gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, while the $700,000 Bob would gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is as strong as he thinks it is, considering the relative value of the money. I'll take a chance and reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not leaving too much on the table. The inflation effect is still affecting the value of the money, so I need to adjust my expectations accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation effect, I need to recalculate the actual values:

My gain of $400,000 is worth 64.2% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 48% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob is being generous or just trying to wear me down. I'll think carefully before making a decision...

After considering the offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I get a slightly larger share, but still leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal. The inflation effect is still a factor, so I need to be strategic about how I allocate the remaining value."
