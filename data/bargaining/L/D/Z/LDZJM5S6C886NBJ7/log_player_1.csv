"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which is a fairly standard starting point in negotiations. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split seems fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer to get something tangible.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
