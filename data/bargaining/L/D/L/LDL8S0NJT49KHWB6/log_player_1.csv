"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that it's now Bob's turn to make an offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that the next round will bring a better offer for me!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less and less, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a jab to try to get Bob to think about the diminishing returns of rejecting my previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob the majority of the money, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll have to make a tough decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 70% of the money, even if it's worth less in real terms. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but it's getting increasingly difficult."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
