"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the $10,000 evenly between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 4000$ for me and 6000$ for Bob, I'll have to consider the decreased value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In terms of the original value, I'd be getting 4000/0.9 = 4444.44, and Bob would be getting 6000/0.9 = 6666.67.

I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after two rounds, it's now worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than he offered me in the previous round, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more than that 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 3500$ for me and 6500$ for Bob, I'll have to consider the decreased value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less each round, and we've had 4 rounds, it's now worth 0.9^4 = 0.6561 of its original value.

In terms of the original value, I'd be getting 3500/0.6561 = 5333.33, and Bob would be getting 6500/0.6561 = 9887.99.

I think this offer is a bit better than the previous one, and it's getting closer to the original 50/50 split. I'll accept the offer.
