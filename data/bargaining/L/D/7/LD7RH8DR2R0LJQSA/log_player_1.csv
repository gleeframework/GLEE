Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less than a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
