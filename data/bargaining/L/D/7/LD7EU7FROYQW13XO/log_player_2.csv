"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can adjust later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is something, it's a very small amount.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to negotiate, especially with the inflation factor coming into play.  I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point.  We can adjust later if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 65/35.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is much better than the initial 10/90 split. While the inflation hurts, I'm gaining a significantly larger share.  It's a good compromise and a step in the right direction."
