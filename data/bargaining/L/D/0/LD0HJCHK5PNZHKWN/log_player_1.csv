"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best option. I was initially looking for a 60% share, and Bob's offer of 50% is still too low for me. I'd like to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my original request."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 45 is too low for me 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I was initially looking for a 60% share, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate due to the inflation. Bob's offer of 45% is still lower than my original request, but it's getting closer. I think I can accept this offer, especially since Bob is willing to give me a bit more."
