# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly more for me 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting anxious, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to eat into the potential gains significantly. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum that's better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
