"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see what kind of offer Alice will make if I reject this one.  Since the money is losing value with each round, I need to get the best possible deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since the money is losing value, I want to secure a larger share. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, I need to consider the inflation. My gains are worth less now, and I'm not sure if Alice will make a better offer in the next round. This offer at least guarantees me some money, and I'm not confident I'll do better in the next round."
