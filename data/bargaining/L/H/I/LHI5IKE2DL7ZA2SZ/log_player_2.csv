Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her demand while the value of the money decreases for me. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings, even with the inflation.  I need to push for a more favorable split soon, but I don't want to seem desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to put a stop to Alice's escalating demands.  Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest solution and avoids the risk of running out of rounds and getting nothing. It emphasizes that continuing this back-and-forth will only hurt both of us in the long run due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a little more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Inflation is eating into my potential gains with each round, and if I reject this offer, there's a real chance I'll end up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
