"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering my higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Alice is facing a higher inflation rate, 55/45 is a pretty lopsided split in her favor. I'm hoping to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split.  We can adjust as the game goes on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation difference, I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's inflation rate is still much higher than mine, this offer is still too lopsided.  I'm willing to compromise, but not that much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better split than the last offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me harder; I need a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too lopsided in Alice's favor. Even though her inflation rate is higher, I'm not willing to give her 60% of the money. I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation too, and I need to make sure I get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share to account for the inflation difference, but I need a more balanced split than the last few offers.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation gap is increasing, I need more to compensate. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I understand Alice's position, I'm not willing to give her 62% of the money. Her inflation rate is high, but so is mine now, and I need a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""I'm trying to be fair, but I can't keep giving you a larger share. This is my final offer, considering the increasing inflation for both of us.""}
