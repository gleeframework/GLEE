Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you, and this is the fairest deal you'll get. A 50/50 split makes the most sense now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
