"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. This offer is still a 40-60 split, but now it's worth less in real terms.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposals.

However, Bob's offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is very similar to my previous offer, and considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept it.
