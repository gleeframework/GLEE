Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. It's in both our best interests to settle this quickly due to the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. 60 for me, 40 for you. This is still a better deal for me due to the inflation, but it's closer to a fair split. Let's not let this drag on any further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor considering the rapid inflation she faces. By rejecting, I'm hoping she'll realize the time pressure is working against her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more even split. However, the inflation is working against you significantly.  Let's be reasonable and settle this now with my offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money rapidly. Let's be reasonable and split the remaining value evenly. This is the only way we can both get anything at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of the inflation. While a 65/35 split would have been ideal in earlier rounds, accepting the 50/50 offer now ensures I at least get a reasonable share before the value diminishes further.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
