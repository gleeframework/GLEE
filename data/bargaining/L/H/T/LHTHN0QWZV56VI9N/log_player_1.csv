"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor. Since the money is worth less now, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share.  Let's end this game and get our share! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
