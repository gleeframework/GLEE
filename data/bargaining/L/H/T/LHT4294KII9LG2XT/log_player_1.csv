"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair and generous offer!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob receives 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair and generous offer, considering the starting amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it closer to 55/45. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds and inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced gain, but I think Bob's proposal is reasonable. The 55/45 split is closer to a fair distribution, and it's better to settle for a decent share than to risk further rounds and inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
