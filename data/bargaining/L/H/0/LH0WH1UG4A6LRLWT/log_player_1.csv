Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness Alice, but this amount better reflects the declining value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the deadline. This offer reflects the time pressure and ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the deadline is approaching, Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. Accepting now would mean losing out significantly compared to my potential gain in round 1. I need to incentivize Bob to agree to a more balanced deal."
