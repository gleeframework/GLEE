Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  Inflation is eating into this deal, so let's close it out this round. This offer gives you what you asked for last time, just with inflation factored in. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
