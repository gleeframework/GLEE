"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a bit more generous than the first one. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still leaving room for a reasonable compromise."

# Alice gain: 3500

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.
