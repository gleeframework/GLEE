"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can avoid the inflation eating away at our gains.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but the inflation hits me harder. I'm sticking with my previous offer for now. It's a good deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer an even split, the inflation is becoming a bigger factor. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, and it's still a decent gain despite the inflation."
