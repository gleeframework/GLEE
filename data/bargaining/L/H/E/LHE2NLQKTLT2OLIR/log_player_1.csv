"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share in the first round, leaving Bob with a small amount.  Since the value of the money decreases with each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to take more, it is a good offer considering the inflation factor.  It is a fair split and a better outcome than rejecting and risking a worse offer in the next round."
