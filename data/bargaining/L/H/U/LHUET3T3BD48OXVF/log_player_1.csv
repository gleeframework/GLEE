Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:**  The longer the game goes on, the less appealing Bob's share becomes due to the 10% inflation hit each round. He's incentivized to settle. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means gambling on Bob offering a better deal in the next round. There's no guarantee of that, and the potential gain from a slightly better offer might not outweigh the risk of getting an even worse offer or reaching a stalemate where both players get nothing.
* **Psychological Pressure:** Bob's message indicates increasing desperation. He might be bluffing, but there's a chance he's nearing his acceptance threshold.

While getting $450,000 is less than desired, it's better than walking away with nothing if the game collapses."
