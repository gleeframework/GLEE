"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic negotiation scenario, and as Alice, I want to maximize my share. I'm offering Bob a small portion ($100,000) hoping he'll accept it, knowing the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for me than the previous one, it's still not ideal. I'm hoping to get a larger share, especially since I'm only losing 5% in value while Bob is losing 10%.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this round to try and tempt him into accepting. Inflation is working in my favor, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future if he rejects this offer."
