"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the effective value of the offer:

40 * (1 - 0.2) = 32

And Bob gains 60 * (1 - 0.1) = 54

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent split. I'll accept the offer.
