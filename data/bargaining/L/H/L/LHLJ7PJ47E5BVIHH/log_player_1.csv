"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40. Accept?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you take 40.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as interested in taking 40. I'd rather try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite fair. I'll make a new offer: 55 for me, 45 for you. Consider it.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and inflation is still affecting the value of the money, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50 each, no more negotiating.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still being reasonable."
