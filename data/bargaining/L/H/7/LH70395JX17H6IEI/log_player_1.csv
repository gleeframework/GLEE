# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and Bob's offer is quite one-sided. I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate further."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on my gains, and I'm not willing to accept a 2:7 split. I think I should get a better share considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further."
