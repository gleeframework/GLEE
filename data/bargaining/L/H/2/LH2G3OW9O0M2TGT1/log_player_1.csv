"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get $50, and we can share the money fairly. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60% share. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more skewed towards me this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less for me, and I need to be more careful with my decisions. However, this offer from Bob seems reasonable, and I'm not sure I can do better. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
