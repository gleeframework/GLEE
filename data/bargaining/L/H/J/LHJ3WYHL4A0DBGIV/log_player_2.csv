Alice's offer:

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than getting nothing, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair and gives us both a good share of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is getting increasingly greedy. I'll reject this offer and see if she's willing to budge in the next round.  While I'm losing value with each round, I'm not willing to settle for such a disproportionate split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500} 
```

I'll offer a slightly higher split for Alice, aiming for a more balanced agreement.  I'm willing to concede a bit, but I still want a significant share of the money."
