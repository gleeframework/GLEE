Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit low. Let's be realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This considers the time value of money with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
