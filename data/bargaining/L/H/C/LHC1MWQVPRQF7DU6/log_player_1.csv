"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 20% less than my original proposal, which is $3,600. Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 5% less than his original proposal, which is $5,225.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my original proposal.
