"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money quickly, knowing that with each round, the value of my share will decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a bit more of the money this time, but I'm also mindful of the inflation factor. I'm still hoping to end the game quickly, so I'm not being overly greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a better deal. Even though my share is decreasing, I'm not ready to accept such a small amount yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my asking price a bit more, but I still think I can get a decent share of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before inflation eats away at my share even further."
