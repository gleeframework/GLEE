Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer, but I want to get as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with the offer, accepting it is the best option.  Since the money I gain is worth less this round, and Bob gets a much better deal, it makes more sense to take the money now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
