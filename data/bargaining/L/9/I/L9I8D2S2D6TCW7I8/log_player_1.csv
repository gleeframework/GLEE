I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering we are both equal players in this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm raising my share slightly to 5200, aiming for a more even split.  While I'm willing to compromise, I still value my own share and want to ensure we both receive a decent amount."
