"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 80% of the initial $6,250 (since it's 20% less than the initial $7,500).

I'll also consider the fact that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, but I don't know the exact value of his gain.

After considering these factors, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
