"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was to give her 900,000 and me 100,000, I'll try to increase my share a bit. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, so I'll try to account for that. Since Alice's offer is 550,000 for me in round 2, which was worth 81% of the original amount, this offer is worth 400,000, which is 72.7% of the original amount. I'll try to increase my share accordingly. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to account for the 19% decrease in value of my gain and 9.75% decrease in value of Alice's gain compared to the first round. Since my gain in round 2 was 550,000, which is 55% of the original amount, I'll aim for a higher percentage in this round.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round, so I'll try to adjust my expectations accordingly. Since Alice's offer is 500,000 for both of us, I'll consider it as 65.61% of the original amount for me. I'll aim for a higher percentage in this round.

However, considering the symmetry of the offer, I'll accept it this time, as it's a 50-50 split, and it's a fair offer given the decreasing value of the money.
