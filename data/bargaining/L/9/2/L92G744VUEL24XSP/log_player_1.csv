Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the time pressure and ensures you get a decent share before inflation erodes its value, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 650000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair offer considering the inflation is affecting you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in his favor considering the impact of inflation on my potential gains. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to push this further."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""bob_gain"": 425000,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it.  A perfectly even split.  Take it before the inflation eats away any more of your share and we both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic. While a 50/50 split would have been ideal earlier, the impact of inflation is significant now. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable sum (even with the inflation), while rejecting it risks getting even less in future rounds if Bob continues to play strategically."
