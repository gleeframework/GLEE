Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I think 60% is a better deal for me than 10%! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60% is a fair share for me, considering the inflation and your last offer. Let's split the money evenly this time.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think 70% is a good compromise this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the inflation has greatly reduced the value of my gains, accepting this offer is the best option. With each rejection, the potential for me to gain anything at all decreases significantly.  It is better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all in the future."
