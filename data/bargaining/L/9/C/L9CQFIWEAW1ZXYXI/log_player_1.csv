```

  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""

```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Round 2

Here's my offer:

```
{

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
