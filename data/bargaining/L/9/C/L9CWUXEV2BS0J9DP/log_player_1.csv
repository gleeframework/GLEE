"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 50/50, and we can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but I'm still being generous. Consider this a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $4,000 is now worth 90% of the original $5,000, which is $4,500. Bob's $6,000 is now worth 80% of the original $5,000, which is $4,000.

I'm not too happy about this offer, as I'm getting less than I would have in the first round. However, I'll consider it a good starting point, as Bob said.
