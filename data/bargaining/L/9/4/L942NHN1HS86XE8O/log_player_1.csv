"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount is 1,000,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially considering the money is worth less now. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still get the majority 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, and Bob's offer is still quite lopsided. I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially considering the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob, let's find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to a more balanced split, considering the continued decrease in the value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not willing to give up the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth significantly less, and Bob's offer is still a bit too lopsided. I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially considering the money is worth so much less now. I'll try to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get close, Bob, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split even closer to a 50-50 split, considering the continued decrease in the value of the money."
