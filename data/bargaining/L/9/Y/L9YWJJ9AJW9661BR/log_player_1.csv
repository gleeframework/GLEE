Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, giving us both a significant portion of the money. Let's finish this quickly before the inflation kicks in! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Reason:While Bob's offer sounds generous, I'm willing to bet he'll become more open to a fairer split as the rounds progress and the money starts losing value. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
