Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money to start with!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the terms of Bob's offer, and I think I can do better.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the original amount. Here's my new offer:
