"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects us differently. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's proposal is to give me $400,000, I'd need to think about whether it's better than the next round's offer, considering the further devaluation of money.

For now, I'll decide to:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 42/58 is a fair split, considering the inflation affects us differently.""
}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than the initial 50/50 split, but still takes into account the difference in the effects of inflation on our gains."
