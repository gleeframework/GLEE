"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since this is the first round and inflation hasn't kicked in yet, I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm losing 80% of my proposed gain from the first round,  it's better to accept this offer than risk losing even more money in the next round due to inflation."
