"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer. I'm assuming Bob is rational and will want to take anything rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's painful to get only $1, it's better than risking getting nothing in the future rounds. Bob's offer is a better deal than waiting, especially with the possibility of further inflation making his future offers even worse for me."
