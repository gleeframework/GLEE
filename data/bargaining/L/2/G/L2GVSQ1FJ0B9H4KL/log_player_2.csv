Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I have 12 rounds to negotiate, and I know the money will be worth less in each subsequent round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation factor, and I believe it's in Alice's best interest to accept."
