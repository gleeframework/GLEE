"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking 9000$ and giving Bob 1000$. This leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it, while still giving me a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even after accounting for inflation. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation and Bob's rejection. This still gives me a substantial portion, but shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still better than nothing. Given the inflation and the limited number of rounds, it's reasonable to accept this offer."
