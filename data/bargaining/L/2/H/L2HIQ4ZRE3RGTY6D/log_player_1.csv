"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll have $5000, and Bob's offer makes us both gain the same amount, which seems fair. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
