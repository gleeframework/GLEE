"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 20% inflation rate is a significant factor, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than $4000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value decreases rapidly, Bob. Let's settle this quickly. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept this offer. The inflation rate has already reduced the value of the money significantly, and Alice's offer is not likely to improve in the next round. I'll take the $3500, which is still a decent amount, rather than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
