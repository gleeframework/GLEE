"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving Bob with $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 90% of that, so I would have gained $5,400 in value. However, due to inflation, that's now worth 90% of 90% of $6,000, which is $4,860.

Bob's gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth 95% of that, so he would have gained $3,800 in value. However, due to inflation, that's now worth 95% of 95% of $4,000, which is $3,595.

Considering Bob's new offer, I would gain $2,500 and Bob would gain $7,500. This is a better deal for me than the original 60/40 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, giving me $4,200 and leaving Bob with $5,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new values:

My gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 72.9% of that, so I would have gained $4,364 in value.

Bob's gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth 85.74% of that, so he would have gained $3,429.60 in value.

Considering Bob's new offer, I would gain $3,000 and Bob would gain $7,000. This is a better deal for me than the previous offers, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
