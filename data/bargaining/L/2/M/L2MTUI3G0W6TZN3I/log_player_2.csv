"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 99% and you get 1% 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""My turn for a proposal.  I'll take 70% and you get 30%. This is a much better offer for you than the last round and time is valuable for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal.  This is my final offer, and if you reject it, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is going down for you each round. Waiting any longer means getting even less.
* **Alice's Confidence:** Her message suggests she might offer even less in the next round, gambling on your desperation to secure a deal before inflation eats away more of your potential gains. 

While $100,000 isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller but guaranteed amount now than risk getting even less later."
