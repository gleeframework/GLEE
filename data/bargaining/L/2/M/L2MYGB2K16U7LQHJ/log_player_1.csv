Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in Bob's favor, especially since I was the one who made the initial offer. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal."
