{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer to split the money 50/50, which means I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000. It's not the most ideal outcome for me, but it's a fair deal considering the circumstances. I'm willing to take the risk of not getting more and just take the deal."
