  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values.

I'm not thrilled with the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a smaller share, but I'd like to propose a 45-55 split instead. Let's meet in the middle.""

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's share, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the absolute values.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is willing to go back to the original 50-50 split. Considering the significant inflation that's taken place, I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me. However, it's also possible that the game is reaching its end, and I might not get a better offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's take the original fair split. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing. Let's end the negotiation here.""
