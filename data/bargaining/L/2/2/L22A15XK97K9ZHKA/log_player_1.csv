```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less, so $100 is now equivalent to $95.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I don't want to meet in the middle, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for a new offer from Bob."
