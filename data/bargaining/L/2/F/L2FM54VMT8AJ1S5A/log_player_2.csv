"Round 1
Alice's offer:

It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal, especially since the inflation rate for Alice is lower than mine.  I'll see if I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation difference, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would ideally get more, the inflation is really hurting my potential gains. It's better to take this offer and secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing at all."
