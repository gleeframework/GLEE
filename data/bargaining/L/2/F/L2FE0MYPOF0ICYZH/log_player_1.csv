Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation that will affect both of us in the next round.  Let's be reasonable and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
