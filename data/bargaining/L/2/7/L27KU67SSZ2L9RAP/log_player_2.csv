"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer sounds ""fair"" on the surface, it heavily favors her due to the inflation rates.  She's taking a larger chunk upfront, knowing it will be worth significantly more than my share over time. I need to negotiate a better split in the initial rounds to make up for the rapid devaluation of the money."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share due to the inflation difference, but my share needs to be higher to start. This offer accounts for some future devaluation."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Countering Alice:** Alice's opening offer aimed to secure a strong advantage from the start. My offer pushes back, establishing that I understand the inflation dynamic but won't accept a deal heavily skewed in her favor. 
* **Early Advantage:** Securing a slight advantage in the early rounds is crucial for me to offset the faster devaluation of my potential earnings. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer isn't overly aggressive. It leaves space for Alice to counter-offer, ideally moving closer to a more agreeable split over the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation difference, I made a slight adjustment to my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's ""slight adjustment"" is anything but generous. While technically giving me a bit more than her initial offer, the impact of inflation means I'm actually losing more ground with this proposal. She's clearly trying to take advantage of my rapidly devaluing position. I need to hold firm and emphasize the shrinking pot."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. The pot is shrinking fast. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation while ensuring we both benefit before it's too late."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Four rounds in, the devaluation is becoming significant. I need to impress upon Alice the urgency of reaching a deal soon.
* **Compromise (but not capitulation):**  I'm slightly lowering my ask to show a willingness to negotiate, but not by much. The offer still leans in my favor to counter the accelerated inflation I face. 
* **Focus on Shared Loss:** By highlighting that the pot is ""shrinking fast,"" I'm emphasizing that her stalling tactics will hurt us both in the long run."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, but the inflation difference still plays in my favor. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a dangerous game and trying to pressure me with the shrinking pot. However, her latest offer is just a repackaged version of her previous ones with slightly better optics.  While the difference between 420,000 and 440,000 might seem tempting given the circumstances, accepting would set a dangerous precedent and validate her strategy of minimal concessions. 

The fact that she claims ""this is as low as I'm willing to go"" at this stage is likely a bluff.  I need to show strength and demonstrate that I'm willing to risk it all to secure a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  We both lose if this goes on any longer."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a fair deal. A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the initial inflation disadvantage, is a powerful statement demonstrating my resolve.
* **Eliminate Inflation Factor:** By proposing an even split, I'm taking the inflation difference out of the equation.  This simplifies the issue and highlights the fact that continued stalling only diminishes the overall pot.
* **Finality:** This offer is my line in the sand.  It puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. She can either accept a reasonable deal now or risk both of us losing out entirely as the value of the money continues to erode."
