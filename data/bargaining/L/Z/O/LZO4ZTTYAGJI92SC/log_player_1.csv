"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  I'm taking a risk by offering a significant amount to Bob, but I figure he might be willing to accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than my initial proposal, it's still not a good deal for me. My share is now worth only 225,000 (250,000 * 0.9).  I'm confident I can get a better deal if we continue to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly.  He rejected my previous offer, so I need to sweeten the deal a bit. However, I'm still keeping the majority for myself. I'm banking on the fact that inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me, and he might be more willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a significant improvement from the last round and it's closer to the 50/50 split I was hoping for in the beginning. While inflation has impacted the value of the money, I've already rejected two offers and Bob's proposal is approaching a fair share. It's better to take what's on the table now and avoid the risk of another round with further inflation."
