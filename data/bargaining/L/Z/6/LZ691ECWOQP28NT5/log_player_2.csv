"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a little more, but you still get a good chunk.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though Alice's message sounds fair, I can potentially get a better deal by waiting and seeing what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's try a split closer to the middle.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  This is a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though inflation has reduced the value of the money, this is a better deal for me than what I proposed. Accepting this offer allows me to gain something, whereas rejecting could lead to a worse outcome due to further inflation."
