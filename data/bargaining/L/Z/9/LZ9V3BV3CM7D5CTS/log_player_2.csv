"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is not fair enough, and I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I want a fair share.""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that is more reasonable, considering we both want a significant share of the money. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept it. Fingers crossed!"
