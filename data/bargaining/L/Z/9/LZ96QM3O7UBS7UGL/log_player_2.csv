Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. The inflation is making things difficult, so I propose a 50/50 split to avoid further losses. We can both agree to that, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
