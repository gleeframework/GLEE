Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going for a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving Alice with a fair share.  Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, Alice's offer is now a 50/50 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
