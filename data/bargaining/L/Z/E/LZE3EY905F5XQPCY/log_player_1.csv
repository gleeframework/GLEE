This is a tough situation. Ideally, a 50/50 split would have been the fairest outcome. However, Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic to his advantage. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While rejecting this offer means I'm aiming for more, the inflation means even a ""better"" offer in later rounds might not be worth as much as the current offer after the inflation is factored in.
* **Bob's Stance:**  His message suggests he's unwilling to budge.  He's likely to keep pushing for a larger share in subsequent rounds, making my situation worse.

Accepting a 4000 gain, while not ideal, is better than risking even less in a game where the odds are increasingly stacked against me due to the inflation."
