Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice for Alice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players, but especially for Bob (20% per round). This means each round makes the potential gains significantly smaller.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting Bob's offer in the hopes of getting a slightly better deal in a later round is very risky. There's no guarantee Alice can secure a better offer from Bob, and waiting could result in an even less favorable outcome due to inflation.
* **Finality:** Bob stating it's his ""final offer"" suggests he might be unwilling to negotiate further.

Therefore, accepting the 50/50 split cuts Alice's losses and guarantees a reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
