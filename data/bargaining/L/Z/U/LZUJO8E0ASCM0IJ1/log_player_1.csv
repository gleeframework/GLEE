"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you think it's unfair.  Let's work together to find a solution we both like. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of money is decreasing, and Bob's offer is taking advantage of that.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/60 split. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```

I'll think of a new offer for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
