Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round. Let's cut our losses and split the remaining money evenly. It's the most logical choice for both of us at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

This is a tough one! While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The money is losing value rapidly for me with each round. Accepting $5,000 now is better than risking an even lower offer in future rounds where the value for me will be significantly eroded.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob seems set on a 50/50 split. He likely won't budge much, and I risk him offering even less in later rounds.

It's frustrating to lose so much to inflation, but sometimes accepting a less than ideal offer is the best strategic move."
