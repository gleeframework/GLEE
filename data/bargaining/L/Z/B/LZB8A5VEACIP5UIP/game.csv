5600.0,4400.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again. How about 56% for me and 44% for you? It's a bit more in my favor considering the faster inflation, but still a decent deal for both of us in these conditions.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Given the increasing inflation, especially on your side, I believe 58% for me is a reasonable adjustment. It's still a good deal for both, considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,"Alright, Bob. I'll accept your offer of 4200 for me and 5800 for you. It's not ideal, but the inflation is eating into the value quickly.",Alice,4,accept
