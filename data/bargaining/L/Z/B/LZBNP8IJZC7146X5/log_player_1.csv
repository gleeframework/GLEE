"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a good start and set the tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the effects of inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $7000 * 0.8 = $5600 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob gain: $3000 * 0.95 = $2850 (due to 5% inflation)

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to Bob, but still a decent amount, hoping to get a better deal than the previous round's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice gain: $6500 * 0.516 (48.8% decrease from the original) = $3350
Bob gain: $3500 * 0.855 (14.26% decrease from the original) = $2992.75

I'll reject this offer, as the actual values are not as favorable as I'd like. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice gain: $6000 * 0.326 (67.23% decrease from the original) = $1956
Bob gain: $4000 * 0.777 (22.62% decrease from the original) = $3108

I'll reject this offer, as the actual values are not favorable to me.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm making a 50/50 split, hoping to find a compromise and end the game."
