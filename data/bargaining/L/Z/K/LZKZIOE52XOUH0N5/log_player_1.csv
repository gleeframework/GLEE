"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid any inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation effects.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effects, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to get a larger share this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to accept and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if this offer is a good deal for me.

However, since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, it seems like he's not taking advantage of the inflation as much as I am. Considering this, I'll accept his offer.
