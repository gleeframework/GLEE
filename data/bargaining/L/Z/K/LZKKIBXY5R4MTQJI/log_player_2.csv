Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's round 5, and the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for Alice. This works in my favor.
* **Decent Offer:** While I'd love to get more, $400,000 is a significant sum. Rejecting means risking an even lower offer in later rounds, especially since Alice is emphasizing this as her final offer.
* **Alice's Declining Returns:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offers have been getting progressively better for me. 

It's a gamble to push further, and I'd rather secure a good amount now than risk getting even less later.
