400000.0,600000.0,I think a 6:4 split is a better reflection of our respective contributions. Let's start the game off strong!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I believe a 50/50 split would be fair given the circumstances. It respects the value of the money while ensuring both of us benefit equally.,Alice,3,
