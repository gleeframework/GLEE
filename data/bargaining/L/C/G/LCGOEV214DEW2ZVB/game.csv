9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work from there if you'd prefer a different split.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Your offer was a bit one-sided. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  This accounts for the time value of the deal for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise and split the money 60/40. It's not my ideal situation, but I think it's fair given the inflation factor. Let's end this round and get the money distributed.",Alice,3,
