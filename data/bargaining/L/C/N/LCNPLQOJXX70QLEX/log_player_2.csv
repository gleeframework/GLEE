"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this game, since the money is worth 5% less for Alice in each subsequent round, it is beneficial for me (Bob) to delay the agreement as much as possible to maximize my gain. Given the significant difference in the proposed division (10,000 for me vs. 990,000 for Alice), and considering the impact of inflation, I believe I can get a better offer in subsequent rounds as Alice will be motivated to settle sooner to minimize her losses due to inflation.\n\nPlease proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I will make a counteroffer that still favors Alice but is more balanced than her initial proposal, considering the inflation factor that affects her more significantly. My goal is to appear reasonable while maximizing my gain, given that time is on my side in this negotiation.
