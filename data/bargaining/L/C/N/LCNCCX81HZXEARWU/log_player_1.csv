"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you get 30. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a good deal too.  Let's split it 60/40, and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 36. And Bob's gain of 60 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 48.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I think I can do better than the 40 I would get if I reject this offer and we proceed to the next round. So, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
