"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $240,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $630,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather have a higher percentage of the original $1,000,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, and the second round's money was already affected by inflation, the effective inflation factor is 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the remaining $1,000,000 and leave 58% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $450,000 is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, which is $512,000.

I'll accept this offer since it's a higher amount than what I would get in the next round.
