"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can end the game right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In the first round, my proposed share was 50% of $10,000, which was $5,000. With 10% inflation, that would be worth $4,500 in the second round.

Bob's offer is $3,000, which is 60% of the reduced value of the original amount ($5,000 * 0.9 = $4,500). That's a bit less than my initial offer, but still a decent share.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
