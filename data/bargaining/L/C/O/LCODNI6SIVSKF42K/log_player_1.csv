Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($990,000) and only gives Bob $10,000. This is a very aggressive opening offer, but I'm banking on the fact that Bob will be tempted to accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting significantly less than I initially offered, the inflation is a serious concern. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
