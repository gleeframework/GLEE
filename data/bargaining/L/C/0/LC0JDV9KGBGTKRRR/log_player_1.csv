"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. Let's try for a more equal split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll accept this offer.
