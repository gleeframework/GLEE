"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get the better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, you can keep a small portion 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it.

I'll think carefully before responding...

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 90% of the money, even if it's worth less in value due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to keep a larger portion of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but it's a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

Let me think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $300,000 and call it a day. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing, and I'm not sure if Bob will make a better offer next round."
