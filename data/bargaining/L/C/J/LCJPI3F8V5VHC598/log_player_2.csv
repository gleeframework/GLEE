"Round 1
Alice's offer:

""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm lowering my demand, but I'm not going any lower. Let's get this done before the money dwindles away completely. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is also starting to become a real factor, especially for Alice. It's time to play hardball and see if she gets nervous."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're both being stubborn. Let's split the money evenly and be done with it. We're both losing too much with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the heat of the inflation, and a 50/50 split is a fair deal. It's better to take this offer than risk getting a worse deal in later rounds as the inflation continues to eat away at the potential winnings."
