"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority, but still leaves Bob with something. It's a bit aggressive, but I want to see if he'll accept it right away.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. I'll take it!"
