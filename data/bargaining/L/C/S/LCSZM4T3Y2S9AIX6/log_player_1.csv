"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority share this round""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we need to account for.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I was hoping to adjust the split accordingly. Bob's proposal still gives me a relatively small share, and I'm not convinced it's a fair split considering the inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's try to find a middle ground""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob receives the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
