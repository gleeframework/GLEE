"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```
I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll be gaining $45 (50 * 0.9) and Bob will be gaining $50. I'll accept this offer.
