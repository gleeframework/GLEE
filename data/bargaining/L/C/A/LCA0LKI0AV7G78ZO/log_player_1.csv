"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $10,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share than before, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! With the money I gain in this round being worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I'll have to be careful.

However, Bob's offer seems quite generous, and I think I should take it. I'll accept the offer.
