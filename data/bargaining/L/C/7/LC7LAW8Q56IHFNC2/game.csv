6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split fairly reflects the potential losses we both face from inflation as the game progresses.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us, but recognizes that your losses are greater.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand your point, but your offer doesn't fully account for the faster rate of my losses. Let's meet closer to the middle ground with this offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains, but time is literally money in this game. Let's settle for a fair and equal 50/50 split to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
