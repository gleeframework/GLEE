"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be reasonable"". This is a generous offer, considering I am giving Bob a significant share of the money. I am hoping Bob will see the reason in my proposal and accept it, rather than risking a decrease in the value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly. This accounts for the fact that I'm making a risk by rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal. Although the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I am still not convinced that a 47.5-52.5 split in Bob's favor is fair. I am willing to take the risk of another round to try to negotiate a better share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI am offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Meet me in the middle"". Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable offer that takes into account the decrease in value of the money. I am hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it, rather than risking another round of inflation."
