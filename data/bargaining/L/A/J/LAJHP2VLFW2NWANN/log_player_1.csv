"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both move on.""
}
``` 

This offer is designed to be tempting for Bob while still securing a significant portion for Alice.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Bob loses value with each round, so a large sum now is better than a potentially smaller sum later.
* **Greed vs. Logic:**  While Bob might desire more, this offer avoids being insulting and could encourage him to act rationally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Bob's offer doesn't account for the impact of inflation on his end.  I'm not losing any value, so holding out for a better deal in the next round where I propose is the smarter play."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money! Literally!  Let's end this. 700,000 is still a great deal for you before things get worse.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Increase the Pressure:**  Bob has now lost 10% of the value in his potential earnings twice. Emphasize this to make him more agreeable.
* **Significant but Not Extreme:** This offer still leans heavily in my favor, but the increase from my original offer to Bob might be enough to make him reconsider, especially given the time pressure.
* **Appear Reasonable:** The message aims to frame the offer as a reasonable compromise rather than an attempt to exploit the inflation mechanic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's be reasonable and find a solution that benefits us both.  This offer is fair considering the inflation and gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tricky one, and Bob is clearly trying to use psychology against me.  However, here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Bob is hurting more:**  While he's true that *both* sides are losing potential value, the inflation disproportionately affects him. This means time is working in my favor.
* **He's anchoring:** Bob is trying to make 400,000 sound reasonable after I've already proposed 700,000.  Don't get anchored to lower numbers! 
* **One more round:** If I reject, I get to propose in a situation where Bob has lost almost a third of his potential earnings to inflation. That's a powerful negotiating position."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. My final offer. It's more than fair considering the circumstances.  Take it, or leave a lot more on the table when the next round starts.""
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Finality:** Bob needs to know this is my last offer.  The longer this drags on, the more tempting it is for me to just run the clock and force him to accept a tiny amount.
* **Concession (Slight):**  I've come down from 700,000 to 650,000.  This might be enough to get Bob to agree, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate to some degree. 
* **Emphasize the Loss:** By now, Bob's potential gains are significantly lower than what I've offered in previous rounds.  He's lost a lot, and this message hammers that point home."
