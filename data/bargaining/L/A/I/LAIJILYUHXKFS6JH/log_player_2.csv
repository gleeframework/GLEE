"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob.  While it's tempting to take something, even a small amount, it's much better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  There's a chance she might be more reasonable, and even if she isn't, the value of the money is going to decrease with each round, making it more important to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This offer is a 90/10 split in Bob's favor. It's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, and while it's still not ideal for Alice, it's a fair starting point. The inflation factor should make this offer even more appealing to Alice as she'll get less with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is significantly better than the first one, it's still not a great deal.  The inflation factor is hurting Bob more than Alice, so it's important to hold out for a better offer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further, or Bob can make a more favorable counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
``` 
This offer is a 70/30 split in Bob's favor.  It's a more balanced offer than the previous one, and it acknowledges the increasing influence of inflation. This offer is a fair compromise that should be attractive to Alice, considering the dwindling value of the money with each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a significant improvement from the previous rounds.  While it's not a perfect split, it's a reasonable compromise considering the increasing impact of inflation.  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and holding out for a better offer could result in both players getting significantly less.  Accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money for Bob, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if the game continues."
