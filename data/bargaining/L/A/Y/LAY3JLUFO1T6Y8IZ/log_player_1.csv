"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable split, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, which is a generous offer, considering the amount is 1,000,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, I need to be careful with my decision. Since my gain would be worth 20% less than in the first round, I'd actually be getting 560,000$ (500,000 / 0.8) if I accept this offer.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, considering the initial offer I made was already quite generous. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You rejected my initial offer, now I'm offering a better deal, don't think you can get a better one!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% of the money, hoping Bob will accept this time."
