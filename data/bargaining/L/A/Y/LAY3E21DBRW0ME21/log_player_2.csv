"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair!  I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm open to negotiation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is fair in this round, I want to see if I can get a better deal later. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I'll try to leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but the inflation is impacting us differently. I propose a split that reflects that. We can talk further if you prefer a more even split."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I need something closer to a 50/50 split to make it fair.  We can't keep going back and forth with these diminishing returns! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I proposed in the previous round, and the inflation is starting to bite. It's time to take the deal before things get worse."
