"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'm not as enthusiastic about Bob's offer. I'll reject it for now. My gain of 4500$ is worth 90% of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is less than what I initially proposed. I'll wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my gain will be worth 81% of what it was in the first round due to inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
