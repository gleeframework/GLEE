# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was 60, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less, I'll have to be more careful with the numbers. Alice's offer is 50-50, which is a fair split, but I was hoping for a better deal. I'll take it, though, since it's a fair split and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
