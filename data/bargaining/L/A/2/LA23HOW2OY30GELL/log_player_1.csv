I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he's going to try to push for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is way too lopsided in his favor.  I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm lowering my offer to Bob, but still keeping a decent share for myself.  This should be a more balanced proposal, considering the inflation factor."
