"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal from Bob! Meeting in the middle is a reasonable approach.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer. We can split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
