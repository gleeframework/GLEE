"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm also giving him a chance to accept and end the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

```

# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, I'd like to think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I'd like to keep negotiating."

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept 30% just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better deal."
