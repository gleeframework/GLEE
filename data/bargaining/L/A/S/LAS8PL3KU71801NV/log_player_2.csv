Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a decent share considering the inflation is hitting you harder. It's better to take this now than risk getting even less later. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
