"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll aim to get a good chunk of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, my proposed gain of $700,000 in the first round is equivalent to $630,000 in the second round, which is more than Bob's offer of $500,000. I'll accept Bob's offer to get $500,000 and end the game.
