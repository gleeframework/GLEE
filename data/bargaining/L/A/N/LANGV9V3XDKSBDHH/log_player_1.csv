"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, giving us both a good amount while accounting for the shrinking value of the money. Let's work together to reach a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
