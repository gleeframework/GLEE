"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront, but we both win big. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money doesn't lose value for me (Bob) with each passing round, but does for Alice, I have an advantage in delaying the agreement. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds, knowing that Alice is under pressure due to the devaluing of the money for her. The initial offer doesn't seem fair enough for me to accept immediately, given the strategic advantage I have over Alice due to the inflation rule."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation pressure on Alice. I'll also attach a message to justify my proposal, aiming to persuade Alice that it's a reasonable deal given the circumstances.

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more balanced offer. The sooner we agree, the less you'll lose.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This offer reflects the time pressure on me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Alice's new offer is still not as favorable as I would like, considering my strategic advantage due to the inflation. Since the money's value remains constant for me but continues to devalue for Alice, I can afford to wait and see if she is willing to compromise further in the next rounds. Alice's offer does not sufficiently account for the increasing pressure the inflation puts on her side, making it reasonable for me to reject this offer and wait for a potentially better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the ongoing inflation affecting Alice's potential gain and my unchanged situation, I will make an offer that reflects the increasing pressure on Alice. My message will aim to highlight the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later, emphasizing the impact of further delays on Alice's potential gain.

{""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""As time passes, your share's value decreases. I'm willing to end this now with a fair offer, given the circumstances. Further delays only reduce your gain.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Alice's emphasis on the fairness of her offer and the impact of inflation on her potential gain, the deal still doesn't adequately compensate me for the strategic advantage I hold due to the inflation mechanics. Given that Alice's share devalues with each passing round while mine remains constant, I can continue to press for a more favorable deal. The pressure of inflation on Alice increases the likelihood that she will be more willing to compromise in subsequent rounds, making it logical for me to reject this offer and continue negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll continue to apply pressure, knowing that Alice is under increasing time pressure due to inflation. My next offer will slightly improve upon the last, but still favor me, as I aim to maximize my gain while considering the urgency for Alice to settle.

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Each round you wait, your share loses more value. I'm willing to settle now, but the offer won't get better for you with time.""}"
