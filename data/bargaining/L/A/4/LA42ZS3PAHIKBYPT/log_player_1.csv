"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I'm starting with a pretty uneven split. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount, knowing he can potentially get more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's a fair offer and I don't want to risk losing all the money due to inflation."
