"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer is fair to both sides and gives Bob a decent share. I'm aiming for a quick agreement but am willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, it's significantly less than what I was initially offered. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a drastic decrease in my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make up for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm losing a huge amount of value due to inflation. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept an offer that leaves me with such a small portion of the original value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is a compromise.  I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, but I'm trying to be reasonable."
