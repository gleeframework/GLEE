"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me taking 80$ and Bob taking 20$. My message is to start with a fair split and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I'd actually be getting $70 * 0.9 = $63. 

I'd like to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take less than 60, can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal and meet in the middle with Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise and meet in the middle, I'll take a bit less to get the game moving""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking 60$ and Bob taking 40$. My message is to compromise and meet in the middle, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's settle here 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll!

With inflation, my gain is now worth 27.1% less, so I'd actually be getting $50 * 0.7231 = $36.155.

I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split and it's a fair compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
