"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give you all the money. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me $800,000 and Bob $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being stingy! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $800,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $640,000. Bob's offer of $250,000 is worth 75% of its original value, which is $187,500.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
