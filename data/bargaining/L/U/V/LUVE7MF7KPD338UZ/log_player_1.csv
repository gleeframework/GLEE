"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting point is a bit too greedy for me. Let's be realistic - this is a negotiation and we both lose if this drags on. I propose a 70/30 split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
