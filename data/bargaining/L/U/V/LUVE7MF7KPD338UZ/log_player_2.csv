Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with a 70/30 split. Let's meet in the middle with a 60/40 split.  This is a more reasonable compromise that acknowledges both our needs. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting the 60/40 split in round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob:

* **Inflation:** Delaying further significantly hurts Bob's potential gains due to the higher inflation rate he faces. 
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice moved from a 90/10 to a 60/40 split, indicating a willingness to negotiate. It's unlikely she'll move much further.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even become more firm in her position.

Accepting now secures Bob a reasonable sum, even if it's less than initially hoped for.
