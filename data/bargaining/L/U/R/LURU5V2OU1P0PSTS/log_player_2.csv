**Reasoning:**

Even though the money I'm getting is worth much less than in the beginning due to inflation, it's still better than getting nothing. 

Here's why I'm accepting this offer:

* **Risk of getting nothing:**  If I continue to reject offers, the risk of both of us getting nothing in the end increases.
* **Alice's Offers:** Alice seems to be gradually decreasing her share, which suggests she might be willing to accept a slightly better deal for me in the future.
* **Inflation:** The inflation rate will continue to erode the value of money.  

By accepting this offer, I secure a decent amount, even if it's significantly less than what I initially hoped for.  There's a chance Alice will become more flexible in the future, and I can use that to my advantage."
