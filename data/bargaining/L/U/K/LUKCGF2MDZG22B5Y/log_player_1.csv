"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount and can still have some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's try for a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to be more generous this time around.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 80% of the money yet. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a sweet spot. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%""
}
```

This offer takes into account the slight decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm still trying to get a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive. Considering the inflation, his offer is actually a slight improvement for me compared to the previous round. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. 45% isn't bad, and I'm not willing to push it further.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally settle on a division of the $10,000."
