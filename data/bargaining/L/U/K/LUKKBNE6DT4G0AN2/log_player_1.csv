"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. I figure this is a good starting point, and since I'm losing less value per round, I'd rather get this settled sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is considerably worse than my previous proposal, and I'm confident I can do better. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still willing to offer Bob a smaller share, but I need to ensure I get a decent amount. I'm reducing my proposed share by $1000, but I'm confident that this is a fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than my ideal, given the rapid inflation and dwindling time, I'm better off accepting this 50/50 split. It's a significant loss from my original proposal, but it's better than getting nothing."
