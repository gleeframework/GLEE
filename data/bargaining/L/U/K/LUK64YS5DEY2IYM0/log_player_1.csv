Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This split accounts for me making the first move in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose out with these delays. I'll take a slightly smaller cut than my initial offer, but this is as low as I'm willing to go.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and the fact that you rejected a nearly identical offer last round. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing a dangerous game, trying to inch his gain up while counting on me to fold under time pressure. However, even with inflation, accepting a near 50/50 split when I had the advantage in earlier rounds sets a bad precedent.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to get a deal that reflects the initial round dynamics."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer.  It's more than fair considering the early rounds. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob by presenting this as my ""final offer.""  While it's slightly less than my Round 3 offer, it's still a clear win for me compared to letting the game continue and the pot shrinking further.  The strong language is designed to make Bob reconsider his strategy."
