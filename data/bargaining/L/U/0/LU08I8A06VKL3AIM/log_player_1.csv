Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this is a reasonable proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Sadly, it's become clear that Bob is willing to drag this out. While accepting this offer means I get significantly less than my initial proposal, rejecting it means risking getting even less in future rounds due to the relentless inflation.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to secure something than risk ending up with even less."
