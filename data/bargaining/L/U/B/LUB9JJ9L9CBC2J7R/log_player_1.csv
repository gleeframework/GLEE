Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You lose 20% of the value each round, so it's better to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
