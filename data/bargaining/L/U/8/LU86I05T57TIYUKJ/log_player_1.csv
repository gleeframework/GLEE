"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. Since we only have 12 rounds, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, before inflation significantly impacts the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  The inflation will only decrease my share further in the next round. It's better to secure half the money now."
