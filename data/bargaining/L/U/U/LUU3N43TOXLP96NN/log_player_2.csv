"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, considering the inflation that affects both of us but hits Alice a bit harder. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split slightly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take a little less, but I need to see a bigger shift in your offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less to both of us with each passing round, but more so for Alice. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the impact of inflation on both of our gains, I'll adjust my offer slightly to see if we can reach a compromise. The money is worth less now, but the proportional decrease is more significant for Alice. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway, considering the inflation impact.""
}
```"
