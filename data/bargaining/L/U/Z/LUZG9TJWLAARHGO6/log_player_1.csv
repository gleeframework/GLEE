Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slightly better split for me this time? It's still a good deal before inflation eats away more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
