"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

 I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. This ensures a significant gain for me, while still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to get a bigger share this time. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm betting he's willing to negotiate. This split still offers him a good chunk of money, but I'm taking a bigger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer isn't as good as my initial proposal, it's still a decent amount of money. It's important to remember that the inflation rate is significantly higher for me than it is for Bob.  At this point, it's in my best interest to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further inflation diminishing my potential gains."
