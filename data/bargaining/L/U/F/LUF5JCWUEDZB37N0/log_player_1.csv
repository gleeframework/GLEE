"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, with me taking a slightly larger share. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 5% decrease in the value of my gain due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my risk-taking skills. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's ""risk-taking skills"" warrant a larger share, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll keep pushing for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,

}
```

This offer takes into account the increased inflation and tries to find a middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
