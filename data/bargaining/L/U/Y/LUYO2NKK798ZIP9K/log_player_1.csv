"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total amount. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering I'm the one taking the risk of rejecting your initial offer. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's taking a risk by rejecting my initial offer, but I'm not convinced he's taking a huge risk since he gets a better deal now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to counter with a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that reflects this decrease. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decreased value of the money, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 10% decrease in value and gives Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeps the majority for myself."
