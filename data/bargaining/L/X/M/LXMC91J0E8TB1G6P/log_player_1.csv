"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is giving me a slightly smaller share, but still a relatively fair deal, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offer in mind, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation and the fact that I want to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still a relatively fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more significantly, I'll consider this new offer. Bob's offer is now 52-48, which is closer to my previous offer of 55-45. Since Bob is giving me a slightly bigger share than before, I'll think it's a good opportunity to accept this offer.
