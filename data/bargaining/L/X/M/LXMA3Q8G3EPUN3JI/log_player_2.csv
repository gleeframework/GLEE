Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering a compromise, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Additionally, the inflation is working against me. Holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is risky, but potentially offers a much higher payoff if I can get Alice to move closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle this now with a 45/55 split? It's a fair deal considering we're running out of time.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Time pressure is increasing. Delaying further significantly impacts my potential gains due to inflation.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to a middle ground, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but not giving in completely.
* **Framing:** Presenting the offer as ""fair"" and highlighting the time constraint might nudge Alice to accept."
