"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with inflation in mind.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less. I'd like to aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money Bob gains due to inflation.

My initial reaction is to reject this offer, as it's not significantly better than my previous offer. However, I'll think about it... 

Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I think this offer is actually a good opportunity for me. I'd rather accept this offer and get a guaranteed 45 dollars, which is still worth a decent amount, rather than risking a potentially worse deal in future rounds.
