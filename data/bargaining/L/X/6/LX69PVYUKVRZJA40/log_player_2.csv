Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time. Inflation is making things complicated, and I'm not sure we'll get a better deal if we keep going. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting the 50/50 split makes sense for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is hitting Bob harder than Alice. Each round of rejection makes the potential gains significantly smaller for Bob. 
* **Fair Offer:**  While Bob could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, the 50/50 split is already relatively fair.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might propose something less favorable, putting Bob in a worse position. 

It's better for Bob to take the sure thing now, even if it's not the absolute optimal outcome.
