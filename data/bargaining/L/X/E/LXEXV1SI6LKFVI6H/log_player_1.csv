"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, I'll be generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is for me to get $400,000 and him to get $600,000, I'm considering the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of money. But, Bob's message says he's being generous, and I don't want to miss out on a good deal.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
