Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The value of this money decreases with every round.  My turn, your turn - it's only going to shrink. I'm offering you 45 which is a better deal than what you'll get if we don't settle now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
