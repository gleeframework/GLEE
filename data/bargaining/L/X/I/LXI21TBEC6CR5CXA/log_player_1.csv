Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a pretty imbalanced starting point, Alice. How about I take a larger share this time - it's only fair considering the inflation we're dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
