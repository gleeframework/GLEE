"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, as I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge. Can we meet in the middle?""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50-50 split Bob suggested earlier. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this compromise."
