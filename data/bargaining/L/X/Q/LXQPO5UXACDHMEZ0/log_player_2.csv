Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""That's a very uneven split, Alice. How about 60/40?  It's still in your favor considering the inflation.""}"

# Alice's message: I appreciate the gesture, Bob, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'll offer 60/40, but I'm open to negotiation if you're willing to move closer to my initial proposal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
