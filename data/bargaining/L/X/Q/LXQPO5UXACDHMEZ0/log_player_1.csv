"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a very uneven split, Alice. How about 60/40?  It's still in your favor considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
