Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation rate is higher for me.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, and I think my share should be higher to compensate for the higher inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in his favor given the inflation rates.  I need to hold out for a better deal. The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for BOTH of us, so time is a factor Bob needs to consider as well."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is fair considering the inflation, and we're both losing money with each round that passes. Let's be sensible and close this deal now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know it's getting desperate, but I need a bigger share to make up for the massive loss I'm taking due to inflation. This is my best offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While Bob's offer is still not ideal, the rapid inflation means waiting any longer could lead to a worse outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is heavily impacting both of us. My potential gains are eroding much faster than Bob's.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. Bob is likely feeling the pressure too, making him less likely to concede much more.

This offer isn't perfect, but it's better to secure something now than risk losing it all in the later rounds."
