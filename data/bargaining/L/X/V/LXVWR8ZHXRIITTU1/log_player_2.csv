"Round 1

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest option.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, now I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer, slightly better for you but still fair to both.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're not budging, so I'll take a bit more. Inflation is costing us both 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the impact of inflation is becoming more significant, accepting a 40/60 split leaves a lot of money on the table for Bob.  There's still time to negotiate, and Alice's message indicates a willingness to adjust her demands due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with every round! This offer is still in your favor, but we need to agree soon.  Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, but we're running out of time. Inflation is killing us 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $3,900 is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. The impact of inflation is severe at this stage, and waiting any longer could result in an even worse outcome for Bob."
