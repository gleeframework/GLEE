"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small cut, but it's a good start! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still trying to keep a slight edge due to the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
