"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 70-30 split, which is a significant concession from his initial 40-60 split. I'll consider it, but I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim to get a bigger share. Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to get a 50-50 split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
