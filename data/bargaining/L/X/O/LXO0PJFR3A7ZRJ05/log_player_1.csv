"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose taking 999,000 dollars and giving Bob 1,000 dollars.  I'm taking the lion's share because I know inflation will hurt my future earnings if we don't reach a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still better than nothing.  Considering inflation, it's likely that this offer will continue to decline in value if we go another round. I'll take the 100,000 and be done with it."
