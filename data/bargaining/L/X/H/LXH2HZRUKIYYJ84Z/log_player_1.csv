"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole $100 if you don't make a counteroffer!""
}
```

This is a strong opening offer, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you 40 and take 60, let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my perception of the offer. I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $100.

The offer is 40% for me and 60% for Bob. I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair share, and I'd rather have 40% of the original $100 than risk going to zero.
