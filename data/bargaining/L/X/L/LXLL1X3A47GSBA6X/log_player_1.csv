Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 20% with each round. In the previous rounds, neither my offer nor Bob's offer was accepted.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on the money's value.
Since the value of money decreases by 20% each round, the effective value of the $100 at the start of Round 3 is 80% of its original value, or $80 in terms of original value.

### Step 3: Determine a fair offer considering the game's progression.
Given the decreasing value of money, it's logical to adjust offers to reflect this decrease. Aiming for a slightly more favorable split than the last offer, but still fair considering the game's mechanics.

### Step 4: Formulate an offer that accounts for the game's progression and includes a persuasive message.
Considering the decrease in value and the need to persuade Bob to accept the offer, I will propose a division that slightly favors me but still appears fair and comes with a compelling message to encourage acceptance.

### Step 5: Create the offer in the specified JSON format.
Based on the steps above, I will create an offer that reflects the current game state and aims to persuade Bob to accept.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's settle this before the money's worth even less!""}"
