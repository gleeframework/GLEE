"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take a small share and we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to get the ball rolling, and I'll take the majority of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Middle ground, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value, I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to meet Bob in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to maintain a bit of an advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money continuing to lose value, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm starting to run out of time. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take 40 dollars. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
