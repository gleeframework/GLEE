Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. Waiting longer means any potential gains will be significantly diminished.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice's offer is worse than her initial one, but better than what Bob proposed. Continuing the game risks Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a decent share. Rejecting and continuing carries the risk of ending up with a much smaller amount if negotiations go south. 

It's a tough decision, but in the face of rapid inflation, sometimes it's best to secure a reasonable deal while you can.
