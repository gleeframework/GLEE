"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll want to negotiate and give me a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You gave me a good starting point, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss of value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a risk by waiting, the money's worth less with each round. I'm offering you a better deal now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're taking inflation into account correctly, but I'll give you another chance to reconsider! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think I made a mistake in calculating the inflation. With the correct calculation, I can see that the money I gain is indeed worth much less than I initially thought.

Considering the correct inflation rate, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one, given the current state of the money. I'll accept it.
