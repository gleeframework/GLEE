Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a more even split. Let's see if Alice agrees!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, I'm not sure I can get a better offer considering the inflation and the fact that Alice rejected my proposal. I'll take the 45$."
