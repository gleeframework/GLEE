"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering I started!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll reject this offer.  While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation will impact Alice more heavily than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm taking a different approach. Since the inflation affects us both, I think a 60/40 split is fair.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less than before, but still think I deserve the bigger share for starting. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I appreciate Alice's attempt to compromise, I'm still not convinced this is the best deal.  The inflation is hitting Alice harder, so I'm going to try to negotiate for a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""With the inflation affecting you more, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I believe a 65/35 split is the fairest outcome for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I still think I should get the larger share. Inflation is biting me harder! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is the best offer I've seen yet.  Alice's inflation is really starting to take effect, and she's made a big concession.  While I'd prefer more, this is a reasonable deal considering the circumstances."
