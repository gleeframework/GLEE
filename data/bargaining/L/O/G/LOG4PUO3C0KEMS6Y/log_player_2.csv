"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to secure a reasonable amount before inflation diminishes its value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the traditional sense, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm aware of the inflation risk and will use that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a decent share before the inflation hits too hard.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of an even split, but time is ticking and inflation is working against you. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer an even split, the inflation is becoming a serious problem. It's better to take the offer now and secure something than risk getting nothing."
