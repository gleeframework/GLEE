Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  It's clear you're aiming for a 50/50 split, but time is literally money in this game.  Take this deal, and we both walk away with something significant. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but she's also clearly feeling the time pressure.  She keeps mentioning the shrinking pot.  While this offer is better than her last, I believe I can squeeze out a little more in the next round.  The risk of getting nothing is growing, but it's a gamble I'm willing to take for a better share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this.  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome.  We both walk away with a good amount.  Don't let's risk getting nothing!""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The time pressure is now immense. With only 6 rounds left, each rejection significantly shrinks the pot. A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, is now the safest and most logical option. It sends a clear message to Alice that Bob is serious about a fair deal and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
