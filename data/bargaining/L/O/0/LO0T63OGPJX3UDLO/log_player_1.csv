"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice takes $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This gives me a good starting point and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob. This is a compromise from the first round, and I hope Bob will see it as a fair split given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a better split. My goal is to maximize my share, and Bob's offers are not attractive enough."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob. I'm still losing value due to inflation, but I think this is a fair split considering the previous rounds. Bob might be more inclined to accept as the inflation is becoming more significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Given the previous rounds, it seems like this is the best split I can get.  I'm hoping Bob is being reasonable and considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
