Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your starting offer was a bit too far off for me.  This is more reasonable, and we need to settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
