"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to give Bob a decent share. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned! With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn again. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is biting, and the money is worth even less now! Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances our gains. Your turn, Bob!"
