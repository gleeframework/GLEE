"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're dealing with. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share. However, 45% is still a bit low for me. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Let's try again!

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 50-50 seems like a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the current state of the money."
