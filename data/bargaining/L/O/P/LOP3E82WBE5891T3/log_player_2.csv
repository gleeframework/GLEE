"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that Alice's money will be worth less in the next round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, giving you a good deal even with the inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think this is more than fair. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a bit more, the inflation is going to hurt Alice's share significantly. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent amount, especially since it's more than her initial offer."
