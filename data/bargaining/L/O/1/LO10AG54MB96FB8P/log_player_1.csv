"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a very aggressive first offer, aiming to secure a large share of the money.  I'm banking on Bob being unsure of the inflation effect and being willing to accept a smaller share in the first round. Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, and while the inflation hurts, it's still a significant gain. I don't want to risk losing even more money by rejecting and going to another round.  It's time to take the win!"
