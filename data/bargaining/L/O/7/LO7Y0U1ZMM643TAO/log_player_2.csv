"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I want most of the pie. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'm hoping that Alice will be more willing to compromise to avoid losing even more value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 425000, ""alice_gain"": 575000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and consider the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe it's in both our interests to come to an agreement sooner rather than later. By offering Alice a larger share, I'm hoping she'll see the value in accepting this proposal and ending the game before the money loses even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need a good share.  Let's finish this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is affecting both of us, but it's impacting Alice more significantly. Given that the value of the money is decreasing with each round, I'm hoping Alice will be more inclined to compromise further to avoid losing even more value. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's settle before it's too late!""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing effect of inflation, which now results in the money I gain being worth 14.26% less and the money Alice gains being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer. I'm hoping that Alice will realize the substantial loss in value we're both experiencing and accept this proposal to minimize further losses. This offer still gives her a larger share, but I believe it's more balanced considering the circumstances."
