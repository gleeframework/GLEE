"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one to make the first counteroffer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he deserves a bit more, huh?

I'm not too thrilled about the revised offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more in my favor.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I think I've been generous enough! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split. However, I don't want to keep playing if the offers are going to keep getting worse for me.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
