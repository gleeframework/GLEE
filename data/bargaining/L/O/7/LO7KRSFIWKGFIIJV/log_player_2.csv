"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get started, take 20% 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is a risk, but I'm willing to take that chance to see if I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'm offering you a good share, and we can get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, take most of it 
# Bob gain: 90 
# Alice gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  Even though Alice is taking a much smaller share, it's a much better deal for me than the 60/40 split I offered in the previous round.  With inflation kicking in, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
