Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split. I'm aiming for the majority share but leaving a small incentive for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take a 50/50 split now than to risk further inflation and potentially get a worse deal later."
