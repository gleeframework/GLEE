"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly and avoid the negative impact of inflation. I'm taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This should be enough to make the offer attractive to Bob, especially considering the potential for his share to decrease in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategic move. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My share will continue to decrease with each round. Accepting now ensures I receive a significant amount.
* **Equal Split:** Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split. While I could potentially get a better offer later, the risk of further inflation outweighs the potential for a larger share.
* **Uncertainty:**  I don't know how inflation affects Bob. He might be willing to offer less in the future, making this a secure option."
