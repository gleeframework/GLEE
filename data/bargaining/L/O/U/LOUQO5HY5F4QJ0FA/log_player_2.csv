"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with 60-40, considering the inflation risk I'm taking!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is a bit more conservative. Let's meet in the middle and close the deal! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers reflect that.  While she claims to be ""meeting in the middle,"" the inflation heavily favors her. Rejecting keeps the pressure on and gives us a chance to propose a more advantageous split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This offer is fair and gives you a good deal considering the inflation. Let's settle this now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating into my share, I need a slightly better deal to compensate. Let's be realistic and end this! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now reasonably close to our previous proposal.  The inflation is significantly impacting her potential gains, making her more willing to compromise.  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to push for a slightly larger share carries the increasing risk of getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in time."
