Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly even split, keeping in mind that my money will depreciate faster than Bob's.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it seems like a fair split on the surface, I'm losing more value per round than he is. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, as I'm still losing value faster. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to accept before the inflation erodes my share even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is really hurting my potential gains.  Accepting this offer will at least secure me a decent amount of money."
