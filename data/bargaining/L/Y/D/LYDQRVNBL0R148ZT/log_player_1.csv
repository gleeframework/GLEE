**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes sense. Here's why:

* **Bob's Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's share is losing value quickly. While he's fixated on a 50/50 split, it's becoming less appealing to him with each round.
* **Potential for a Worse Offer:** If I reject this, Bob might become more desperate and offer even less in the next round as his potential gain continues to shrink. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees I get 50% of the initial amount. Rejecting and continuing carries the risk of Bob either becoming more stubborn or the game going on long enough that the inflation significantly impacts my potential gains too. 

It's a tough call, but sometimes a sure thing is better than risking a worse outcome."
