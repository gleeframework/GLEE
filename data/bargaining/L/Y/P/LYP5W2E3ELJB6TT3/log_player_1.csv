I'm going for a strong opening offer, aiming for 90% of the money!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a big step down from my initial proposal. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm dropping my offer slightly to 80%, hoping Bob sees the value in getting something rather than risking nothing.  The pressure is on him now, as the next round will see the value of my money drop another 5%!"

Round 4

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, even though the value of the money I receive is dropping. I'm not going to accept this yet, but I need to start considering the decreasing value of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again, but only to 70%. I'm hoping Bob will realize the value of getting something rather than continuing to play this game and potentially getting nothing.  The pressure is on him now, as the next round will see the value of my money drop another 5%!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even though the value of the money I receive is dropping significantly. I'm determined to get a better deal, but I need to start thinking strategically about how much more I can realistically expect."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 60% but hoping Bob will recognize that the value of his money is staying the same while mine is dropping rapidly. I need to start accepting some compromises to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible, and the value of the money I receive is dropping faster than ever. I'm still not ready to accept such a small amount. I'm going to try one more offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The value of my money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to secure something before it's too late. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in a fair deal and end this game."
