While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I know the value of the money decreases much faster for her than for me. It's better to wait for a more favorable offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value, but this offer is still not good enough for me. I'll hold out for a bit longer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this offer ensures you get something substantial before the value drops further.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share before inflation further erodes Alice's potential gain, pushing her towards riskier proposals."
