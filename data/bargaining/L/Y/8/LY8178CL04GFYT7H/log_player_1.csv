"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if $5,000 is enough for me. I'd like to see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with a slight adjustment from the previous round. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share to get a better deal, what do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a significant toll on my gain. Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. With the inflation affecting my gain, $3,000 is a more reasonable amount for me, and Bob's larger share is a good compromise. I'm willing to take this deal to end the game."
