This is a fair starting point. I want to get the majority of the money, but I also want to give Bob enough to potentially encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still offer Bob a decent amount. Inflation is starting to hurt him more than me, so he might be more willing to accept a slightly smaller portion."
