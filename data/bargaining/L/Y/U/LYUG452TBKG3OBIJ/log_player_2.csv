It's a very small amount, but at least Bob gets something.  He should reject it and try to make a final counteroffer in round 12."

``` 

It's risky, but Bob needs to gamble at this point. He's likely to get nothing if he doesn't make a bold counteroffer.  It's possible Alice might be swayed by the desperation of the situation and accept, as she has already rejected his earlier offer."
