"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be a little more even. How about 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $45 is actually worth 95% of the initial $60, which is $57.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
