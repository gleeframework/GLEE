"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now (due to 10% inflation), I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* Alice's offer: Bob gets $5800, which is worth 19% less than $5000, so it's equivalent to $4060 in the first round. Alice gets $4200, which is worth 19% less than $5000, so it's equivalent to $3400 in the first round.
* My initial goal was to get $5000, but since Alice offered $4060, which is close, I'll take it.
