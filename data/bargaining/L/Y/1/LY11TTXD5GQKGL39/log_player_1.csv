"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the money 50/50. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $4000. Bob's offer is a bit more in his favor, but I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my share will be worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
