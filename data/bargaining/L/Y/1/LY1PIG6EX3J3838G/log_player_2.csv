"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 70/30 split in my favor.  Consider the inflation working against you.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but I need a bit more.  How about 65/35?  The clock is ticking, and the inflation is getting worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. The inflation is hurting me more, but accepting a deal this bad this early sets a bad precedent for future rounds. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but this needs to be mutually beneficial. 55/45 is my final offer for this round. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We're running out of time.  60/40 is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but consider the consequences of waiting any longer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a more equitable split, time is running out. Accepting Alice's offer of 60/40 now still nets me a significant sum that's worth considerably more than holding out for a potentially better deal and risking getting nothing. The impact of inflation is becoming too large to ignore."
