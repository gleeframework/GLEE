"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but you'll get a chance to propose in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better deal.\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\nSince the money's value decreases more significantly for Alice, I believe she'll be inclined to accept a more balanced offer this round, rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but I think a more even split is fair. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gain and the relatively lower impact on mine, I believe I can still push for a better deal. The difference in the devaluation of our gains gives me leverage to negotiate further.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant devaluation of your share, I think this is a generous offer. Further rounds will only decrease the value more drastically for you.""}\n\nGiven the increasing difference in the value of the money due to inflation, where my loss is minimal compared to Alice's significant loss, I'm positioning my offer to reflect this disparity, emphasizing that waiting further will only disadvantage her more."
