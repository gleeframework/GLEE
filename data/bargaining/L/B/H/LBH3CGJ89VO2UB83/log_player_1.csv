"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I think that's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I was hoping to get a slightly better deal, considering I'm the one making the initial offer. I'll reject this proposal and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer I made. Let's see if you can do better.""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, trying to get a better deal than the previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and give me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I still think a near-even split is the best way to go. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is a good deal for me, especially considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I was hoping for a more significant increase from Bob's previous offer. I'll reject this proposal and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a 75-25 split, trying to get a better deal than the previous offers. I'm willing to take a risk and go for a more extreme split, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and give me a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close to a deal. Let's try splitting it 40/60, similar to your initial offer.  It's a compromise, and we can both still walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a decent compromise, considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. A 40-60 split is not ideal, but it's better than the previous offers. I'm willing to accept this deal and end the game, hoping to get something rather than nothing."
