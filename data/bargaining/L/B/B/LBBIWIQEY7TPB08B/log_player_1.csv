"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a bigger chunk of the remaining money 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my proposed gain of 5000 in the first round would be equivalent to 4500 in the second round, so this offer is a bit more attractive.

However, I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept a smaller share, but I want more than 3000""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 10% less than the previous round, my proposed gain in the first round would be equivalent to 4500 in the third round, and Bob's offer of 7000 in the second round would be equivalent to 6300 in the third round.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a fair share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than the first round, my proposed gain in the first round would be equivalent to 3630 in the fourth round, and Bob's offer of 5800 in the third round would be equivalent to 4221 in the fourth round.

I'm getting closer to the 50-50 split, but I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but not that much""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than the first round, my proposed gain in the first round would be equivalent to 3630 in the fifth round, and Bob's offer of 6000 in the fourth round would be equivalent to 4374 in the fifth round.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.
