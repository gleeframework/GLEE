"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first to make the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more balanced this time! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 70$ is worth 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is a good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
