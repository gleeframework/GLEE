"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob a small share, which might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though the money is worth less, I still have a chance to get a better deal in the next round.  I will make a more favorable proposal to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 15% this round. Since the money is worth less than before, I think this is a fair offer for him and gives me the most possible while still being somewhat reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The money is now worth significantly less, and Bob is offering a much better share than in the previous round. I'll accept this offer."
