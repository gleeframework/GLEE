"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly. I need to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is proposing a 50/50 split, it's a fair offer, but it's not as generous as my initial proposal. I'll have to consider the long-term implications of accepting this offer. 

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Bob's offer is now more generous than my previous offer, and it's a 60/40 split in his favor. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll think about accepting this offer.
