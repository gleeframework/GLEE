Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly clinging to getting a larger share, but the deal is getting worse for me rapidly.  I need to send a strong signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a more equitable split soon. Another rejection might push her to be more reasonable in Round 6, where I'll have the final offer before the effects of inflation become very severe."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. Inflation makes further negotiation pointless.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strong hand.  Repeating my Round 2 offer, but framing it as a non-negotiable ultimatum, sends a clear message. I'm emphasizing that this is her last chance for a favorable deal before inflation significantly erodes the value of any potential agreement for me."
