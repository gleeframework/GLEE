"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $6000, which is 60% of the total amount, and Bob would receive $4000, which is 40% of the total amount. The message ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation"" aims to persuade Bob that this division is reasonable, given that the value of money decreases more significantly for him with each passing round. This initial offer sets the stage for negotiations, taking into account the impact of inflation on our respective gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation that affects us both, but to a different degree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation and the fact that Bob's offer still seems somewhat balanced despite the differing impacts of inflation on us, I decide to reject the offer. The reasoning is that accepting this early in the game might not maximize my potential gain, especially since the difference in inflation impact might allow for a more favorable division in later rounds. Thus, I opt to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI need to adjust my strategy considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Given that the money is worth less with each round, especially for Bob, I'll make an offer that still favors me but might be more acceptable to Bob, who is losing more value with each rejection.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing loss from inflation, let's settle on this before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer slightly reduces my gain from the initial proposal, acknowledging the pressure of inflation on both of us but still aiming to maximize my share, considering the negotiations might not go on for many more rounds.\n\nLet me know how Bob responds to this offer."
