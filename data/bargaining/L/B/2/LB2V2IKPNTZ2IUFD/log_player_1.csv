"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous, but inflation is a beast! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it still favors him, especially considering the inflation disadvantage is hitting me harder. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. This factors in the inflation for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  We've both lost money due to inflation. It's important to acknowledge this in the offer.
* **Strategic Shift:** Bob's last offer suggests he's willing to move closer to a more even split. My offer is a counter that still favors me but shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:**  Every round that passes costs us both money.  This offer aims to reach a fair agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer above 50/50, Alice. Let's settle this before inflation eats our profits! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:** The inflation is eating into the potential gains significantly now.  Delaying further will likely result in a worse outcome even if I can get a slightly better split.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message suggests this is his best offer.  Holding out further risks him pushing for a worse deal in the next round.
* **Reasonable Gain:** While not ideal, 4800 is still a significant gain even with the inflation factored in. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a much lower offer in Round 5."
