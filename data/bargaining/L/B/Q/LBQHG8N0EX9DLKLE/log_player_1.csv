"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money to start with, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $80 is now worth $72 (80 x 0.9).

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a good idea to split the money evenly, especially since we're already on the second round and the money is losing value quickly. I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
