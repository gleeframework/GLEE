"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, which is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 2:1, a slightly more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my potential gain is 20% less than in the first round, so I'll calculate my gain as 80% of 60, which is 48.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, let's try again""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, and 40% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Let's aim for a slightly higher share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""Still a good compromise, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

This offer gives me 72% of the remaining value, which I hope is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 3:2, a slightly more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my potential gain in the fourth round. Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain as 51.2% of 70, which is 35.84.

I'll compare this to Bob's offer, which is 70. Since 70 is more than 35.84, I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You got a good deal, I guess!""
}
```

I'm glad we could agree on a split!"
