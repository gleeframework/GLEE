"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, the total value of the money is $90 (100 - 10%).

Bob's offer is 50:50, which is a fair split. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a good opportunity to split the difference. I'll accept Bob's offer.
