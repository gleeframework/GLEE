Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  Let's split it 70/30 in my favor.  I'm willing to move a bit, but not much more.  This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and that you're losing value on your side. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
