"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer because I'm not getting as much value as I would have in the first round, even though the numbers are higher. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less from the first round and another 10% less from the second round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll calculate the adjusted value of my potential gain.

Initially, I was aiming for 720,000 in round 3, but due to the 27.1% decrease, that would be equivalent to approximately 522,720 in the first round's value. However, Bob's offer is 400,000, which is even lower than that.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that the next round will bring a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 37.1% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on the money's value. I'll calculate the adjusted value of my potential gain.

Initially, I was aiming for 540,000 in round 5, but due to the 40.95% decrease, that would be equivalent to approximately 318,540 in the first round's value. However, Bob's offer is 450,000, which is higher than that.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best deal I've seen so far.
