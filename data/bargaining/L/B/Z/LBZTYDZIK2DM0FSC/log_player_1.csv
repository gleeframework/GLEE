"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I think we can both agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

My current gain of $6,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $5,700. Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $3,200.

Bob's new offer is $2,000 for me and $8,000 for him. Considering the reduced value of the money, this is a more favorable offer for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
