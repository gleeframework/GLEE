I propose to keep 950,000$ and give Bob 50,000$. I believe this is a fair offer as it gives me the majority of the money while still offering Bob a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself.  Since my offer was rejected in the previous round, I'm offering a more even split, hoping to reach an agreement before the next round of inflation."
