  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to be more careful with my decision.
