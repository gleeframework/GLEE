"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. I'll also include a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since this is the first round, the money is still worth its full value to both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in a more equitable split. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 10% less to me, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 in terms of its original value. Considering this, I think I can do better than that in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my offer to try to find a mutually acceptable split. I'll offer Bob a bit more than before, but still try to get a good deal for myself.
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money and keep 55% for myself. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's settle this fairly. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round. Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually worth around $327,950 in terms of its original value. Considering that Bob claims this is his final offer, I need to weigh the risks of rejecting it. If I reject it, I might end up with nothing if we can't agree on a split within the remaining rounds. Given the decreasing value of the money for me and the risk of getting nothing, I think accepting Bob's offer is the best choice.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's hope I made the right decision!"
