"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60% for me seems reasonable since I'm the one making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time - 55% for me and 45% for you. Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing in the end.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since I've already lost 20% of the value, I'll take a bit more this time. Still a good deal for you, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame the situation to her advantage, but she's losing value significantly faster than I am.  While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to push for a more equitable split before she loses too much leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm offering you 400,000 -  it's more than you would have gotten last round if you had accepted my offer.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, Alice loses more value, increasing the pressure for her to accept a deal. I need to emphasize this urgency.
* **Shift in Power:**  While my previous offer was generous, I need to adjust to reflect the changing circumstances. This offer is still reasonable but gives me a larger share.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm stating a firm offer and directly referencing the value she lost by declining my previous proposal. This might encourage her to accept before the deal gets worse for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know I'm losing value, but I still think I deserve more than 40%. Meet me in the middle, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, but her idea of ""meeting in the middle"" is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering she's losing value rapidly. I need to stand firm and wait for a more reasonable offer.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game - and you're losing it fast. I'm offering you 350,000. Take it before it shrinks even further!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  Alice is now past the halfway point in terms of value lost. I need to keep the pressure high and highlight how much she stands to lose by continuing to decline.
* **Slight Adjustment:** I'm increasing my demand slightly to reflect the shrinking pot from Alice's perspective. This offer is still potentially acceptable to her, but only if she acts quickly.
* **Direct Language:** I'm using strong language (""literally money,"" ""shrinks even further"") to drive home the urgency of the situation and encourage her to accept this offer before it's too late."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll take a bit less, but I still think I can get a better deal than what you're offering. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky now. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a win and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.  Here's why:

* **Significant Value Loss:** Alice has lost over 70% of her potential gains. This offer, while still favoring her, is less skewed than before.
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the later rounds, and Alice might get desperate enough to accept an even worse deal for her (but potentially better for me) if this continues. However, there's also the increasing risk that she'll refuse to budge and we'll both lose. 
* **Guaranteed Win:** Accepting this offer guarantees I walk away with a significant sum of money. It's better to secure a win now than risk losing everything in the hopes of a slightly larger gain."
