# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather not risk further inflation.  Let's call it a day."
