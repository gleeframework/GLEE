Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly banking on Bob being more afraid of inflation. While the offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to push for a more significant shift in his favor, or he risks getting increasingly worse offers as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Inflation is hurting us both - let's settle this now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  A firm stance now is essential.
* **Inflation Factor:**  Continually rejecting offers hurts both players.  A 50/50 split, even accounting for past inflation, is better than nothing.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer highlights the fairness factor and the shared risk of inflation, potentially pushing Alice to accept rather than risk even lower returns in later rounds."
