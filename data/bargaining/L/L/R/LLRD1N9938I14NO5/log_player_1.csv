"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you a fair share, now it's your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40% for now. It's your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better take the offer while it's still worth something.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
