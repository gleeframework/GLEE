"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering we'll both be impacted by inflation moving forward. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather not accept a 40% gain, as it's worth less than 50% of the original amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more to account for inflation!""
}
