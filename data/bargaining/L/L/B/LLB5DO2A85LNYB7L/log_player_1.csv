"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the effective amounts are:

My gain: $5,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.9 (10% less) = $4,500
Bob's gain: $5,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.8 (20% less) = $4,000

I'll accept this offer.
