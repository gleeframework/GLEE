I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm starting with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer, hoping to avoid unnecessary rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm reducing my share by 5% to counter the inflation and offering a 55/45 split. It's still slightly in my favor, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise."
