"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer, but still room for negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split in Bob's favor.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll accept 4500 for me, and we can discuss further!""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer, hoping Bob will accept this compromise."

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the 35/65 split in Bob's favor.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll accept 4000 for me, and we can discuss further!""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to give me a bit more, but I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity in the split."
