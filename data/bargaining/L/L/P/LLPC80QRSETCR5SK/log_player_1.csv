"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70 dollars and Bob will get 30 dollars, which is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting with 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept an even split at 50% each, since it's not as beneficial to me as it was in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% of 100$), I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You said it's the fairest way to split it. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
