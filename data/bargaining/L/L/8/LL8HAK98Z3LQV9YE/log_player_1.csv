"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully... Since Bob's offer is equal, it seems like a fair split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking a bigger bite now!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the risk of rejecting and going to the next round might not be worth it. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
