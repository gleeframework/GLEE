I'm starting with a proposal that gives Bob a small share, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, with the inflation factor, a 50/50 split is a decent outcome. Accepting ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
