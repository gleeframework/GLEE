"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round is now worth $5,700.

Bob's offer of $5,000 is a 50-50 split, which is a significant improvement from my previous offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a good deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
