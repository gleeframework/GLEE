"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high offer for myself, knowing that the money will depreciate. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll have a chance to make a more reasonable offer next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 999980 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even with the inflation, this is still a very good offer for me. I'm willing to take it and end the game."
