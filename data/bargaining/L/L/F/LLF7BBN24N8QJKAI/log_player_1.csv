"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, considering the inflation factor that affects both of us differently. This split seems fair given the conditions of the game. Let's see how Bob responds!\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts us both in a tough spot, but a 50/50 split in the long run hurts me more than you. This offer is more reflective of that imbalance. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his argument about the imbalance due to inflation, his proposed split doesn't adequately account for the significantly higher rate of devaluation I'm facing (10% per round vs. his 5%). Accepting this would put me at a disadvantage as the game progresses.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more equitable division.\n\n###\n\nIt's my turn again! Here's my next proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the increased impact of inflation on my gains, this split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us, while still providing a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his mention of compromise, the split he's proposing still doesn't adequately address the disproportionate impact of inflation on my potential gains. Given that we're both losing value with each round, it's crucial to find a division that more equitably shares the burden of inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round, where I'll aim to propose a division that better reflects the current state of our inflation-adjusted values.\n\n###\n\nIt's my turn again! Here's my next proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Given the urgency and the impact of inflation, let's meet closer to the middle, considering my higher rate of loss.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
