"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60% for me, 40% for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 490000,
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous. This is a better deal than you'll get next round!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice loses value slower than Bob with each round.  It's in Bob's best interest to settle quickly. 
* **Appearing Generous:** Offering Alice slightly more than she proposed in the previous round might make her more likely to accept.  
* **Future Discounting:** Alice's proposed 60%/40% split in Round 1 will be worth less to her in Round 3 if she rejects this offer. By highlighting the time-sensitive nature of the deal, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think 58% for me and 42% for you is a fair deal now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer acknowledges the impact of inflation, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting, Bob calls her bluff and emphasizes that he's willing to risk further inflation to secure a better deal. This increases the pressure on Alice to propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice! Let's settle this now. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadline Pressure:** By stating this is his ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency.  Alice knows if she rejects this, Bob might walk away in the next round, leaving her with nothing. 
* **Slight Concession:** Bob has slightly reduced his demand from 49% in Round 2 to 48%, making it seem like he's negotiating. 
* **Inflation Factor:** While not explicitly mentioned, the implication is that waiting any longer will only hurt them both due to inflation. 
 
This offer walks a tightrope. Bob needs to balance appearing flexible to encourage Alice to accept while also showing he's serious about not being lowballed."
