"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep the majority of the money, 99$, while giving Bob only 1$. This is a risky move, as Bob might reject this offer, but it ensures a significant gain for me in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Bob's offer is much better than what he offered in the first round, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the future.  The inflation effect might make future offers less appealing."
