"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm keeping the remaining 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting my slightly higher negotiation skills.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 x 0.9 = 405,000
* Bob gain: 550,000 x 0.9 = 495,000

Considering the offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offer from Bob, I'll try to counter with a more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I think 52/48 is a more balanced split, considering the initial proposal and the current state of the negotiation.""
}
