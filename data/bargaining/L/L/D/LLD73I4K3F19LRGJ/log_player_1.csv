"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to keep almost all the money for myself. As Bob is losing 20% of his money value in each round, I expect him to accept this offer in order to avoid losing more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer to keep more money, it's better to accept Bob's offer now. If I reject, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, and due to inflation, the money Bob gets will be worth even less, making it less likely he'll accept my offer in the future. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best outcome for me at this point."
