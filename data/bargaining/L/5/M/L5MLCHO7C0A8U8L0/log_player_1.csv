"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  I believe it's in my best interest to get the money sooner rather than later, as the inflation will hurt my share more if we keep playing."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob's offer is more equitable, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  The inflation penalty on my share is heavier than his, so it's worth taking a risk and seeing if I can improve my outcome in the next round."
