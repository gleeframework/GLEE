"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and Bob's offer is quite generous. However, I'm not willing to give up too much, especially since I have 10 rounds left.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob was willing to give me a smaller share in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking its toll! The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer is even more generous than before, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a good opportunity to get a significant share of the money before it loses more value.
