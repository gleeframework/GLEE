Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it or let's see how much the money shrinks! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
