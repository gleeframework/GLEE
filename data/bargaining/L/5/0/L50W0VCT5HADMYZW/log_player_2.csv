Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll offer a bit more than last time 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""This offer accounts for the time pressure and is my final offer.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'll give you one more chance 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal is better than risking another round with even less value for Bob."
