"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was a bit too far in your favor, Alice. Let's be reasonable - this offer still gets us both a good amount before inflation eats into it too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
