"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 99.9% and you get 0.1%,  it's a great deal! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is incredibly unfair.  While it's true I'm getting a tiny amount, it's still worth fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split.  I'm willing to take the bigger share, but you deserve a fair portion too.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise now. Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the smaller share this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a much more reasonable offer, and I'm happy to accept. It's a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on the majority of the money by continuing to reject offers."
