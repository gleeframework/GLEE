"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 70-30 ratio. This seems fair considering the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's always tempting to take a quick gain, but in this game, knowing inflation affects the value of money, it's better to see what Alice offers in the next round.  The 70/30 split is not very favorable to Bob, and there's a chance Alice might offer a better deal to secure the money now rather than risk further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the potential for inflation, but still allows for a fair share for you.""
