"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm getting 4800 dollars instead of 6000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more even, but I'd like to try to get an even better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, so I'm thinking of making a new offer that takes that into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
