"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a 60/40 split. It's a fair deal that allows us to benefit before inflation kicks in. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 40%. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a more even distribution, considering the inflation risk.""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about an even split. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? We both get a decent amount, and it avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI already offered a 55/45 split in my favor and Alice rejected it, so I see no reason to accept a 55/45 split in her favor. Let's continue negotiating!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Since we both proposed a 55/45 split and couldn't agree, I'll increase my share slightly to 57. This is a reasonable adjustment, considering the increasing loss from inflation.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but time is running out, and the money keeps shrinking. I'm willing to come down slightly to 52/48.  Let's end this before we lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've already offered Alice a 57/43 split, so a 52/48 split in her favor isn't acceptable to me. I think I can still get a better deal, and I'm willing to risk further inflation to try and get it. Let's keep negotiating!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but we're running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option to avoid further losses from inflation.  Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I've been trying to get a better deal, but considering the significant loss from inflation, a 50/50 split is starting to look like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
