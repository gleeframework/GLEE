I'm offering a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  Let's see what Bob thinks!  I figure he's better off with 1000 than nothing, especially if he doesn't know about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is trying to pull a fast one! I'm not going to accept that offer.  I'll take my chances with the next round and make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still going to try to get a good share of the money, but with inflation, I'm going to have to offer Bob a bit more.  I think 8000/2000 is a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting greedy!  I'm not going to let him get away with this.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to get a majority of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that if we don't agree soon, the money will be worth less and less for both of us."
