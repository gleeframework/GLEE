# Alice's message: Let's start with a relatively fair offer, Bob. I get $6000 and you get $4000. It's better to agree early as inflation is eating away our money!

# Alice gain: 6000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but still favors you too much considering the faster inflation for me. How about we switch amounts - $5500 for me and $4500 for you? It's a fair deal in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet.

We should settle soon before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the urgency in settling the deal and accept this offer. \n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the game! \n\n###\n\n(Remember, as Bob, I'm trying to balance between getting a good deal and avoiding further losses due to inflation.)"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting us both. I'm willing to come down slightly to $5200, letting you have $4800. Let's settle this before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money, especially for Alice, I think this offer is reasonable. It's better to accept this deal now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds. \n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here! \n\n###\n\n(Remember, as Bob, my goal was to maximize my gain while considering the effects of inflation, and I believe this offer achieves that.)"
