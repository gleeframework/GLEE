"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This is a good starting point, as it gives me a significant share while leaving some room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation affecting Bob's gains makes this a reasonable offer. Accepting guarantees me a significant amount, and risking further rounds could lead to a worse outcome for me."
