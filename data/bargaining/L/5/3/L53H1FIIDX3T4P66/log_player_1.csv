Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm taking the majority of the money, as I'm confident I can make a good deal in future rounds if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
