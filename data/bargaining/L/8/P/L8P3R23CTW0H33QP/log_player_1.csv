Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time, Alice. I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we have to deal with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
