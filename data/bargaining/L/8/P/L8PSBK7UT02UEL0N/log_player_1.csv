"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher share, but not 80%! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that the 60/40 split is fair, considering the initial offer was 80/20. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous""}

I'm proposing that I receive $7,000 and Bob receives $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a decent compromise. Meeting in the middle at $5,000 each might be a good way to end the game.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and split the remaining $10,000 equally."
