Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I have the first move advantage.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is slightly less in my favor, it's still a good deal considering the inflation. I'm willing to take the 5500 now rather than risk a less favorable outcome in the next round."
