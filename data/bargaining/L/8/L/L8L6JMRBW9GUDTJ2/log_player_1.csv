```

  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the lion's share! I'll have to think carefully about this.

I'll reject the offer for now. The money is worth less than before, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money's value decreasing by 5% each round, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is sticking to his guns! With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'll have to think strategically.

I'll reject this offer as well. The difference between our proposed shares is still too large, and I'd like to try to get a more even split.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
