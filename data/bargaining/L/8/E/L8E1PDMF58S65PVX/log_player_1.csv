"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
