I'm going to try to get the most money possible while still ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Since it's the first round and the money is still at full value, I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This should be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as he's getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's true that my money is worth less, it's still better for me to keep playing. In the next round, I'll be the one making the offer and I can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try and get as much money as possible, but I need to take into account that the money is worth less for me with each passing round. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and is likely to be more assertive, I'm offering a 80/20 split. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but hopefully, it will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
