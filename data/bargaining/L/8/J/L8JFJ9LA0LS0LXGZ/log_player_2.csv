"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer slightly favors Alice. While it seems like a decent starting point, the significant inflation working against Alice makes it worthwhile for Bob to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This offer accounts for the rapid inflation you face, Alice. It ensures a larger portion of the value is preserved for you.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I've adjusted. Let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer still favors her, even with the adjusted amounts. It seems she's trying to take advantage of Bob's knowledge about her rapid inflation rate. Bob should hold out for a better deal, as time is still on his side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer provides a fair deal considering the decreasing value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more. I need a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tricky one, but Bob should still hold strong. While Alice is right about inflation hitting her harder, this offer still significantly favors her. She's likely feeling the pressure and trying to secure a deal, even if it's not perfectly balanced. Bob has some leverage to push for a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."
