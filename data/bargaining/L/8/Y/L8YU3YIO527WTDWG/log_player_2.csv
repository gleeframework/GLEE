Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent split, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better if we split this a bit more evenly. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm confident that this is the best I can do considering the inflation.  It's a decent gain for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
