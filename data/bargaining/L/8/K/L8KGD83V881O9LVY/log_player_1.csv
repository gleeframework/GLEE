"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 55:45 in my favor. This takes into account the inflation we both face, but it still gives you a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
