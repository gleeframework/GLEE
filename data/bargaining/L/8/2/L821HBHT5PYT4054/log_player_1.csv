"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the money and leave 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We have plenty of time to negotiate if we need to. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the original 70, so I'd get 63 dollars, and Bob would get 35 dollars.

I don't think this offer is very appealing to me, considering I could have gotten 70 dollars in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round, so I'd get 56.1 dollars, and Bob would get 43.9 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
