I propose we split the money 90/10 in my favor.  This is a good starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise and offer a more even split, but I still need to get a decent share.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both."
