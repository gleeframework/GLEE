"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is fair 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing out on a larger percentage of the money due to inflation, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all. The offer is basically the same as the first round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
