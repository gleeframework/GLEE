"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly. This is a strong starting point to encourage a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and while I'm aware of inflation, it's too early to accept such a drastic reduction. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering an 80/20 split. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still more advantageous to me. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation and Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is beginning to take a toll.  However, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split just yet.  I believe I can still secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split.  While inflation continues to be a factor, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself, and this offer is a step towards reaching a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'm disappointed that the inflation has reduced my potential earnings significantly, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances. With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing outweighs the desire for a more favorable split. I accept."
