Let's see what Alice offers in the next round!  I'm not going to settle for such a small portion of the money."

I'm proposing a more even split, but I want to keep the majority for myself.  It's my turn to make the offer, and I'm aiming for a good outcome!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is still being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a small share, even with inflation.  I'll keep trying for a better deal."

I'm increasing my share slightly but still offering a reasonable amount to Alice. Hopefully, she'll see this as a fair compromise."

Alice's offers are getting worse, even with the inflation factor. I'm not going to accept such a small share.  I'll keep trying for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  With inflation increasing, it's becoming harder to get a good deal.  Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair and reasonable solution."
