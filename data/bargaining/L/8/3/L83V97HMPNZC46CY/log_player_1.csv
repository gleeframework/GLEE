"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. My message is a straightforward proposal, suggesting that this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it 6:4, a better deal for you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,600 in real terms.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, as I think I can do better. I'll reject this proposal and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low for me, I'll make a better offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in the third round, my gain of $5,000 would be worth $4,500 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try again""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leaving $5,500 for Bob, hoping that this is a more reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, but I'm closer to the middle this time 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less in the fourth round, my gain of $5,800 would be worth $4,232.80 in real terms.

I think this offer is a bit better, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
