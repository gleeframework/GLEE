"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the original $10,000. This way, we both get a decent amount and can continue playing if you'd like to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, Alice. I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 2,500 x 0.95 = 2,375
* Bob gain: 7,500 x 0.95 = 7,125

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable as my original proposal. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, the original amounts are now 95% of the previous amounts. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

This offer is slightly more generous to Bob than my initial proposal, but still takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll give you a slight edge this time. You can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5,000 x 0.8574 = 4,287
* Bob gain: 5,000 x 0.8574 = 4,287

This offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
