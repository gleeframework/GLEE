Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want more, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's compromise. I'll take 4500, and you can have the rest.  We both get something, and it's a better deal for me than the last round. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
