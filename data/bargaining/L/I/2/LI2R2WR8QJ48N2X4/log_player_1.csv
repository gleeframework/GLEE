"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and keeping the remaining $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is now worth less than my initial offer of $600,000. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation effect. Since my previous offer of $600,000 is now worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This time, I'm offering you $300,000, which is 30% of the initial $1,000,000, and keeping the remaining $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is taking a toll on my gains. With the money worth 14.26% less than the initial $600,000, my gain of $450,000 is now worth around $491,000. Considering the offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.
