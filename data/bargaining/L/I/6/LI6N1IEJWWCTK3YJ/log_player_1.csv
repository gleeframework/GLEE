"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the initial offer, let's see if you'll accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% from round 1 and 5% from round 2), I'll have to be even more cautious.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm not being too aggressive, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to a deal, but I still think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings. With the money worth 24.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful.

However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my previous offers, and I don't want to risk waiting too long and losing even more value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
