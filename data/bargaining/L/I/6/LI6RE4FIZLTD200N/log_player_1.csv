"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and leaving $300,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this round, but I'm open to a more even split later if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $700,000 in Round 1 is now worth $560,000.

Considering Bob's offer for Round 2, I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $560,000 in Round 2 is now worth $448,000.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55:45""
}
```"
