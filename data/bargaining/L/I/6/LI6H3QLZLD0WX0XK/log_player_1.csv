"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take 999,000$ and leave Bob with 1,000$.  This ensures I get the most possible in this round, knowing that if Bob rejects the offer, I will have to pay him more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While I am losing money with each round, taking $1,000 now is less than what I can get in the next round.  I will be able to offer Bob a better deal than what he is offering me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  Even with the 10% inflation hit, this is still a better deal for me than taking $1,000. This is a more balanced offer that might be appealing to Bob, especially if he's hoping to maximize his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer.  My gains have been significantly reduced by inflation, and this offer is far better than what I could get by rejecting and continuing the game."
