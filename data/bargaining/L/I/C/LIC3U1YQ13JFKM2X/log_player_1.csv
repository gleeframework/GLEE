"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but not 50/50 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 36, and Bob's gain of 60 is now worth 54.

I'm not sure I like the uneven split, but I'll consider it. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need something in return!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more uneven split, hoping to get a better deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving up 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 25 is now worth 18.25, and Bob's gain of 75 is now worth 64.51.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, my gain is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a big chunk to get something!""
}
```

I'm offering a very uneven split, hoping to get a better deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
