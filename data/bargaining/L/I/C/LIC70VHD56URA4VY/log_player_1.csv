"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80/20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the $8,000 I would have gotten in the first round is now worth $6,400 in today's money.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $6,400 I would have gotten in the previous round is now worth $5,120 in today's money. I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than last round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than last round 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the 48.8% inflation, the $8,000 I would have gotten in the first round is now worth $4,160 in today's money. My previous offer would be worth $4,480, but Bob's new offer is $4,500.

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get closer to the original value.
