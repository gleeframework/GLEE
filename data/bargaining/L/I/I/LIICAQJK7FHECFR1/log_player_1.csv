"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share for now""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to get a better deal in the subsequent rounds as the money loses value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather not split it evenly, as I think I can do better in the next round. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less in the third round, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $47.25 in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but I'm not getting greedy""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better deal this round, while still keeping a larger share for myself."
