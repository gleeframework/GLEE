Let's see what I can get!  I think I can do better than this."

I'm going to start with a more even split. I think this is fair, and gives Alice a good starting point.  Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is getting greedier! I'm still hoping to get a better deal, and I think I can.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's fair, and hopefully Alice will see the value of a quick resolution."
