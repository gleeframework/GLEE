"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's my turn to make the next proposal and I don't want to risk losing more value with each passing round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
