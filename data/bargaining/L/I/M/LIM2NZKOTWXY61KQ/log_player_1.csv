"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting. Since the offer is slightly better for me than the previous one, and the stakes are getting lower with each round, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
