I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this proposal gives him a significant majority of the money. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. The money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the value of the money Bob gains has decreased significantly due to inflation. This offer is even more lopsided than the previous ones, and I'm not willing to accept such an unfair deal. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

I'm proposing a 30:70 split, where I get $3,000 and Bob gets $7,000. I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want a fair deal. This is my last chance, so I hope Bob will accept this offer."
