"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round, I'm taking a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to consider the actual value of the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000. If I accept this offer, I'll get 300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and Bob will get 700,000, which is 70% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was 50/50. However, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split. This way, I'll get a bit more than Bob's initial offer to me, but still less than his 70% share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60/40 is a fair compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my ideal, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $450,000 is worth 85.74% of the original $500,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $428,700.

Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55% of the original $1,000,000, which is $550,000.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 55/45 split, which is closer to his initial 70/30 offer. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split as well, but this time in my favor. I'll offer Bob the same percentage, but with a smaller amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's mirror your offer, 55/45 is a fair split, but this time I'll get a bit more!""
