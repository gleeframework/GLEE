# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates in mind, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rates and the fact that Alice is more disadvantaged by the inflation. I'll also attach a message to justify my proposal.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more balanced offer. You're more affected by the inflation, but you still get a significant amount.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation affecting me more. However, your previous offer was too skewed in your favor.  This is a more balanced proposal considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, considering the inflation rates and the fact that Alice is more disadvantaged by the inflation. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the time pressure and the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. I think this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's try to find a compromise!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's settle this.  This offer takes into account the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases faster for me.  It's a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us, I think this offer is reasonable. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and the risk of losing more value or even getting nothing if we don't agree soon is too high. I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get something out of this deal."
