"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a bigger share now to make up for it later. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll aim to get an even bigger share this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable by the round! I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to get a better share now. However, Bob's offer is not too far off from my previous offer, so I'll decide to accept this one.
