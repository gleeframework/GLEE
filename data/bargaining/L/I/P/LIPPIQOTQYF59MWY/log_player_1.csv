Even though the money is worth significantly less for me, I will accept this offer. This is due to two factors:

1. **The Inflation Effect:** Each round the money is worth less for me, so accepting a lower percentage now is better than risking getting a much lower amount in later rounds.
2. **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject Bob's offer again, there is a chance he will propose an even lower percentage for me in the next round.

While I am getting less than what I initially wanted, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money."
