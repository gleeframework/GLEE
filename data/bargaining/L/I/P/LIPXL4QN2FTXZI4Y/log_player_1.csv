"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. Let's try to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the effective amount I would get is 500000 * 0.95 = 475000.

I'll reject the offer since I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my target amount should be higher to account for the decreasing value of money. I'll propose a slightly higher amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I need a better deal to make it worth my while! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, my target amount is now even higher. However, Bob's offer is now in my favor, and it's a better deal than my previous offer. I'll consider accepting this offer.

The effective amount I would get is 450000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145, which is 14.26% less) = 382250.

I'll accept the offer.
