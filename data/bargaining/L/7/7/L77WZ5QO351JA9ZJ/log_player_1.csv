"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 300k and we can split the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a slightly better offer. How about we split it 40-60? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 40-60 is a good split for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to nudge the split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we split it 50-50? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value of the money, a 50-50 split is starting to look more appealing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to call it a day and split the remaining money 50-50."
