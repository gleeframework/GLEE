"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the 50 dollars I'd gain is worth 80% of the original value, which is 40 dollars. I'd be giving up 40 dollars, and Bob would be giving up 50 dollars, which is worth 45 dollars in the original value.

I'll accept this offer.
