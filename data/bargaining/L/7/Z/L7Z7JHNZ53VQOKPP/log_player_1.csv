I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's not ideal, but with the inflation, my share is worth less each round.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least something."
