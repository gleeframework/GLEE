"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll let Bob decide if he wants to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount now, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty lopsided deal. I'm not willing to accept such a small share. Let's try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not willing to give up much more. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
