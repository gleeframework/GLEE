"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split relatively evenly, but slightly in my favor considering the inflation disadvantage I have. This ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, it's a fair deal considering we both have to deal with the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects us both. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I still need a slight edge considering the faster devaluation of my share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take what I can get at this point, as the inflation will keep eating away at my share."
