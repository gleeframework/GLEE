"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% and Bob getting 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation. The money is worth less, so I need to get a larger share to be happy.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me, I need more!""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Still a fair split, but I'm getting a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting 70% and Bob getting 30%. I think this is a good balance, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreased value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll accept his offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take it!""
}
```

I'll get $4,000, which is better than nothing, and I'll just have to hope for better deals in the remaining rounds."
