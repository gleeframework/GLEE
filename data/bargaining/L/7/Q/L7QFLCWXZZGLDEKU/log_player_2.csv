"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I get a bit more as the money loses value faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept an offer that heavily favors Alice, especially given the inflation dynamic.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, Alice. We both lose value on the money, so a 50/50 split seems fairest.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the fairness concern, Bob, but the money loses value much faster for me. I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a deal that significantly favors her.  While the inflation is hitting her harder, it's still too early in the game to accept such an uneven split. Let's see if she'll budge more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but the split needs to be closer to even. Let's try 4750/5250, which accounts for some of the inflation difference.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value quickly. This is my final offer - it's a reasonable split considering the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the money is losing value quickly, Alice's final offer is still too lopsided in her favor.  The inflation difference is substantial, but it doesn't justify such a significant disparity.  Let's see if we can negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find common ground. I'm willing to go up to 4500 for you, but we're getting close to the end and the money is losing value. It's time to meet halfway.""}
