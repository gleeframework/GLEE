"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This offer gives me a significant share, but also leaves something for Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm getting less than in the first round, Bob's offer still seems unfair. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but with the inflation and Bob's last offer, I think this is a fair compromise."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still losing a lot of money due to inflation. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
