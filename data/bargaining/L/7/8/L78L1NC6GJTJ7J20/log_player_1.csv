"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent offer, but I'm not giving away too much. This is my best shot. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth the same as $160,000 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 20% less than $1,000,000, which is $800,000.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's offer was quite skewed towards him, I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You offered me a lowball, now it's my turn to make a strong counteroffer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much more. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! Let's analyze it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value of the amounts. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 51.2% of the original $1,000,000, which is $512,000 in the first round. My gain of $400,000 is worth the same as $400,000 in the first round.

Considering the offers so far, I think this one is a bit more reasonable. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll decide to reject it and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, given that Bob's offer was still slightly skewed towards him. I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to walk away, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give away too much more. This is my last offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer. Bob's gain of $300,000 is worth 30% of the original $1,000,000, which is $300,000 in the first round. My gain of $700,000 is worth the same as $700,000 in the first round.

Considering the offers so far, I think this one is a bit more reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal due to further inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
