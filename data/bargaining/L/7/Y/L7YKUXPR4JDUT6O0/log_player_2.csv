Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm still in a strong position to hold out for a better deal.  It's still early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's settle this now.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise but also drawing a line in the sand.  This offer is still advantageous to me but gives Alice a reasonable amount considering the inflation working against her.  The ""final offer"" statement adds a bit of pressure."
