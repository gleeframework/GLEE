"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original amount.

Bob's offer is 550,000$ for him and 450,000$ for me, but in terms of the original amount, he's offering 550,000/0.9 = 611,111$ for himself and 450,000/1 = 450,000$ for me.

I'll accept this offer.
