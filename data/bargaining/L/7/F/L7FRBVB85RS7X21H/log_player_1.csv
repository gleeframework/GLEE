"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less in this round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. However, Bob's offer is a significant concession, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still seems reasonable given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Given the reduced value, I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer, but I'll also consider the fact that Bob's offer is not too far off from the initial 50-50 split. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. With a 14.26% reduction in value, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate. Here's my next offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping the reduced value of the money will make it more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 37.5 
# Bob gain: 62.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. With a 22.62% reduction, I'll need to be more cautious with my next offer. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but it's not a bad deal considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
