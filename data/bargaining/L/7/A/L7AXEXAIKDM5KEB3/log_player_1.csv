"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'd rather negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself to account for the reduced value of the money."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to a 55/45 split. I'm not happy with that, especially considering the increased inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, I need a bigger share to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value of the money."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm holding firm, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns, and I'm not getting a better offer. Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
