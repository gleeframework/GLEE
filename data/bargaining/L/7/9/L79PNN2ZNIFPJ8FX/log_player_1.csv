"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair and square split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can split the $100 evenly between us."
