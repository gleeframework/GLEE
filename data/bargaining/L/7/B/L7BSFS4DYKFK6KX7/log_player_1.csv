"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but it's still a reasonable proposal. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
