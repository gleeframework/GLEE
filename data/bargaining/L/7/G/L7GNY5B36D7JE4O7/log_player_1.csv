Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I should get more since I'm not getting the benefit of being the first proposer. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Okay, I see your point about being the second proposer.  Let's try a 70/30 split in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not going to give away the farm.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up that much more. I think 50/50 is a fair split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. With inflation, the value of the money is shrinking rapidly. Accepting a 40/60 split ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing if Bob decides to keep rejecting offers."
