"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $800,000.

So, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 300,000 / 0.8 = $375,000
Bob gain: 700,000 / 0.8 = $875,000

I'll reject this offer, as I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $616,000, and I'll take the remaining $384,000."
