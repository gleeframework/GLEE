"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving Bob with $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the new total is $9,500.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with meeting in the middle, especially since I was hoping to get a larger share earlier on. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, the new total is $9,500.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the current $9,500, which is $6,000, and leaving Bob with $4,000. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the new total is $8,620.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I was hoping to get a larger share. However, I don't want to risk rejecting again and potentially ending up with nothing.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in future rounds.
