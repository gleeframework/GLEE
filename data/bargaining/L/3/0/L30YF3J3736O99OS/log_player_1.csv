"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. Considering the new values, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $240,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth $630,000.

I accept Bob's offer.
