Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offers are creeping up slightly, they are nowhere near a fair split considering the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me each round.  I need to hold firm and hope she gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious. This is as low as I can go. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly decreasing my offer again to appear flexible but firm.  The ""take it or leave it"" language is intended to signal that I'm not willing to negotiate further and that she risks losing everything if she continues to play hardball."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was as low as you can go, but I still think I can get a better deal 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly enjoying this, but I'm not going to crack.  Her offer is insulting considering the inflation rate.  I need to hold firm and call her bluff. There's a real chance she'll start to panic in the later rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""We're running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Don't be greedy, Alice.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on now.  I'm going with a 50/50 split to signal that I'm serious about not getting ripped off, but also offering a fair solution that prevents us both from walking away with nothing. It's a gamble, but Alice's stubbornness might backfire in these last few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A 50/50 split isn't fair considering the inflation, I need a little more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is incredibly frustrating, but we are now in the endgame.  Alice is still trying to take advantage, but with only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very real.  Accepting this offer guarantees me something, even if it's significantly less than what I could have had in the first round.  It's better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all."
