Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. This is my counteroffer 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. While unfair, it's the final round and Alice knows the inflation heavily impacts me. 

* **Accepting:** I get $43 which is worth only about $17 due to the 59.04% inflation. 
* **Rejecting:**  I get $0, and Alice likely anticipated my desperation. 

It's a bitter pill, but taking the $17 (equivalent) is the only way to leave with something."
