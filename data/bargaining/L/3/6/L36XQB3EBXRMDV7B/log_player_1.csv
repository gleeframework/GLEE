"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too keen on this offer, as I'd rather not give up more than I have to. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I need more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not thrilled about giving up even more. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer.
