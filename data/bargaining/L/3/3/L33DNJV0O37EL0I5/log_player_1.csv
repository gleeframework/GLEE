"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer for me to get a slightly larger share this time, as we both have to account for the inflation now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth less due to inflation, and Bob's offer doesn't seem to account for the greater decrease in value on his end, I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, given the inflation impact. Let's split the difference this time. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 4\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially on Bob's end, and the fact that his offer doesn't seem to adequately reflect this disparity, I'll reject this offer. The difference in the impact of inflation on our shares should lead to a more favorable split for me, considering the value retention.\n\nI'll make another proposal in the next round, aiming for a split that better accounts for the differing inflation impacts."

Round 5

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, given the current state of our negotiations."
