**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split, even with inflation eating away at the value.  While the difference is getting smaller, it's worth holding out for a bit longer to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split or a slightly favorable advantage for myself."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, inflation is killing us! Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with the 50/50 split. It's fair, and the message emphasizes the urgency of the situation due to inflation.  Alice needs to understand that her stubbornness is hurting both of us."
