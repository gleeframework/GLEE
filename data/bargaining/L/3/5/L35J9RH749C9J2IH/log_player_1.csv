"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not too happy with this offer.

I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 40% less for Bob (20% less from Round 1 and another 20% less from Round 2), I'll aim for a better split.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bigger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, this offer is actually a good one for me.

I'll accept it.
