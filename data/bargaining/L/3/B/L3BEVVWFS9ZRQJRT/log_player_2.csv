**Reasoning:**

At this point, the value of waiting for a potentially better offer is outweighed by the increasing inflation.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I could get a slightly better offer in the next round, the inflation means the actual value I receive will be significantly less. 
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is likely aware of the pressure the inflation puts on me. She's making increasingly better offers for herself, knowing I'm running out of time.
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a payout. Rejecting it risks getting a worse offer in the final round or even walking away with nothing.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer is the most rational decision considering the circumstances."
