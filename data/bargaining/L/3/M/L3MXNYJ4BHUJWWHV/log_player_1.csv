"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share of the money, but it's still reasonable for Bob.  I want to see if he'll accept this initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, I'm losing money faster than Bob with each round. Accepting this even split is the best way to maximize my potential gains, especially since I'm losing 5% each round while he's losing 10%."
