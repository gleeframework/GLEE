"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm aiming for a large portion of the money in the first round. I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a small amount compared to the total.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's better than getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly better than getting nothing in the later rounds, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get more than $300,000 if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe I can still get a better deal than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Inflation is starting to have a serious impact, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal than this.  A 50/50 split is fair, considering the risk of getting nothing if we reach the final round.  It's time to end the negotiation and secure my share of the money."
