"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation you'll face if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair at first glance, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money a bit more in my favor, but I want to finish this quickly to avoid the inflation eating away at my share. Let's call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since you're losing value each round, I think this is a reasonable adjustment. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm still losing value, the rate of loss is starting to be significant. It's better to accept this offer and secure something than risk losing more in the next round."
