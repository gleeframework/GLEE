Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's stop wasting time with the inflation eating away at our potential profits. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split seems fair at this point, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both of us. I'd rather not risk further devaluation."
