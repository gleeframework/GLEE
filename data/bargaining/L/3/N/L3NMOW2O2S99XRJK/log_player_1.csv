I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's still a decent amount for him.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is better for me than what I proposed in the previous round. Even though I'm getting less, it's still a significant amount of money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if we keep going."
