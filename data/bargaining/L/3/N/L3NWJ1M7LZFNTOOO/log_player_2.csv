Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 50/50 split is fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know inflation will make the money worth less in future rounds, but I'm willing to risk it for a chance at a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  I'm offering you 400,000, which is still a significant amount, and gives me a bit more to work with. Let's get this done.""
