"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but let's not be too greedy! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is 30-70, which is a significant deviation from the initial 60-40 split. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive move. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to counter Bob's previous 30-70 offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up my edge! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money being worth 48.8% less, I need to be extremely cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too favorable to him, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make another move that will give me a better chance of getting a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth even less, and I need to be more aggressive. I'll try to push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, I need a better share to make up for inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to take back some of the ground I've lost due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
