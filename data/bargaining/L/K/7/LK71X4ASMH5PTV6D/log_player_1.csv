``` 

This is a tough spot.  Here's why I'm accepting even though it's a bad deal:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is killing me. I'm losing almost half the value each round.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has been pretty firm, and it's unlikely he'll go much lower.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If I reject, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in the next round if Bob stays firm or I miscalculate. 

It's a gamble either way, but at this point, cutting my losses and taking the $3,900 (which is still something) feels like the safest option."
