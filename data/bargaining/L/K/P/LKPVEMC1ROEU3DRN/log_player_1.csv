"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the value of the money I gain and the money Bob gains.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still gain $3000 in real terms. However, Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 20% less due to inflation, which means he's effectively gaining $5600 in real terms.

Considering the ratio of our gains, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer as I was about the 50/50 split in the first round. I'd rather not accept this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not as favorable as I had hoped, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll gain $2000 in real terms. However, Bob's gain of $8000 is worth a staggering 51.2% less than in the first round, which means he's effectively gaining only $4800 in real terms.

Considering the ratio of our gains, I think this offer is still not favorable enough for me. I'd rather not accept this offer.

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to get a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big share, but I'm willing to give you a tiny bit 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on the value of the money now! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll gain $1000 in real terms. However, Bob's gain of $9000 is worth a massive 72.17% less than in the first round, which means he's effectively gaining only $2800 in real terms.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. At this point, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out against the effects of inflation. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800,
  ""bob_gain"": 9200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need something to show for this. Take most of the money, but give me a token amount.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob the vast majority of the money, but I'm trying to get at least something for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
