"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With the inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I'm effectively getting $140,000 (700,000 * 0.9). Bob's offer is 200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the next round, the money is worth 10% less again, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the erosion of value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

To calculate my effective gain, I'll multiply my potential gain by the cumulative inflation factor (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81). So, my effective gain would be $486,000 (600,000 * 0.81).

Bob's offer of $100,000 is even lower than my effective gain, which is a significant reduction. Considering the inflation, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. In the next round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 72.9% of its original value.

Considering this, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the erosion of value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

To calculate my effective gain, I'll multiply my potential gain by the cumulative inflation factor (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729). So, my effective gain would be $400,500 (600,000 * 0.729).

Bob's offer of $50,000 is a significant reduction from my effective gain, and considering the inflation, it's a very small fraction of the original amount. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. In the next round, the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 59.05% of its original value.

Considering this, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the erosion of value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really accelerating!

To calculate my effective gain, I'll multiply my potential gain by the cumulative inflation factor (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.729 = 0.5905). So, my effective gain would be $294,050 (600,000 * 0.5905).

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a tiny fraction of my effective gain, and considering the inflation, it's almost negligible. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. In the next round, the money is worth 52.17% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 47.83% of its original value.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on the value of the money!

To calculate my effective gain, I'll multiply my potential gain by the cumulative inflation factor (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.729 * 0.5905 = 0.4181). So, my effective gain would be $249,900 (600,000 * 0.4181).

Bob's offer of $1,000 is an extremely small fraction of my effective gain, and considering the inflation, it's almost negligible. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. In the next round, the money is worth 61.26% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 38.74% of its original value.

Considering this, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the erosion of value. Here's my new offer:

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is almost complete, and the value of the money is extremely low.

To calculate my effective gain, I'll multiply my potential gain by the cumulative inflation factor (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.729 * 0.5905 * 0.4181 = 0.2094). So, my effective gain would be $124,800 (600,000 * 0.2094).

Bob's offer of $100 is an extremely small fraction of my effective gain, and considering the inflation, it's almost nothing. I'll decide to reject this offer, but I'm starting to think that it's time to accept a low offer, as the value of the money is almost gone.

However, I'll still try to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It seems like we've reached a point where the value of the money is almost negligible. If I reject this offer, we'll end up with nothing. I'll reconsider my decision and accept the offer in the next round, but for now, I'll reject it.

(Note: I'll accept the offer in the next round, but it's too late, as it's the last round)"
