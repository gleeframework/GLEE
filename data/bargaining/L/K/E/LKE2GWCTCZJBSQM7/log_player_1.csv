"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob. Accept and we can split the cash.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice. It's a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my potential gain is now $9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and I'd rather not risk going to Round 3 with even less value in the money.
