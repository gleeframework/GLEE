"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us a good head start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems like a good deal initially, the steep inflation working against her means I can likely secure a much better outcome by waiting for a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money, and yours is disappearing fast.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle, Bob? This deal still favors you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more realistic split, but the inflation is working heavily in my favor.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more desperate in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  Take this deal before it depreciates even further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both lose out if this drags on. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. While a 70/30 split would be ideal, the longer this goes on, the more we both lose. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise at this stage."
