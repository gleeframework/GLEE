"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. This offer gives me a slight advantage, but you'll still get a sizable amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is generous, it's in my best interest to see what other offers might come my way. I want to maximize my potential gains, and the prospect of getting more in later rounds is appealing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""This offer is more balanced than the last. Let's end this quickly, and we can both walk away with a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a balanced deal, but time is working against us both. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to take its toll. Alice's offer is still a decent amount, and accepting now ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing later."
