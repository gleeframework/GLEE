"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. I lose value faster than Alice. By rejecting and making a counter-proposal, I can aim for a more advantageous split that accounts for the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand your desire for a 60-40 split, but the value decreases rapidly for me. How about we meet closer to the middle with 45-55?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Addressing Inflation:**  My offer acknowledges the inflation disparity. While still favoring Alice, it shifts the balance slightly in my favor compared to her initial proposal.
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground that seems reasonable.  Starting with a counter-proposal closer to what I want leaves room for further negotiation if she rejects it. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the total value decreases. It's important to move the negotiation forward and hopefully reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. A 58-42 split might have been acceptable in the first round, but now the value has diminished significantly. I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split, factoring in the decreasing value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose with each passing round.  I'm proposing 47-53. It's a strong offer considering the shrinking value.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the time pressure to encourage Alice to take a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving closer to her previous offer to signal willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a split that reflects the inflation disparity.
* **Framing:** By calling it a ""strong offer,"" I'm subtly suggesting this is a good deal for her in light of the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I still believe I can get a bit more. How about 56-44? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a 50-50 split, but her offer still doesn't adequately account for the rapid inflation hitting my share. We're over halfway through the rounds, and the value is dropping rapidly.  While 56-44 might seem tempting, it's not in my best interest given the shrinking pot. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it - my final offer. A straight 50-50 split is the fairest option considering the time pressure and the shrinking value. Let's close the deal and both walk away with something!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm communicating that I'm serious and won't accept anything less favorable.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  A 50-50 split, while not ideal in light of the initial inflation difference, becomes increasingly reasonable as the rounds progress. It emphasizes that we're both losing out the longer this goes on.
* **Urgency:** With only a few rounds left, I need to push for a decision. The message highlights the diminishing returns and encourages Alice to accept before we both get nothing."
