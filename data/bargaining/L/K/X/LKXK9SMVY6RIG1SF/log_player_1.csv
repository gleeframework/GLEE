Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is fair considering the inflation risk. Let's go with 550k for me and 450k for you. This way, we both have a comfortable margin to weather the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
