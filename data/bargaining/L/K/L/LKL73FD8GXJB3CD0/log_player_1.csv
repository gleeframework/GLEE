"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a very generous first offer considering the inflation risk. I hope Bob sees it that way!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk losing more money with inflation. Let's call it a day!"
