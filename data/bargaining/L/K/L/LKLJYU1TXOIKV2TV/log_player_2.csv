Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, inflation hurts us both 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, inflation is hitting me harder than Alice. Accepting this offer now means I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential value due to the rapid devaluation of my gains. I need to push for a slightly better split to compensate for the inflation disparity."
