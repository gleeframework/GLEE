"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This way, we both get a good amount. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. A 60/40 split doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can get a better offer in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45. It's a more even split, considering the inflation affects you more.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe she'll be more inclined to accept a deal sooner rather than later. A 55/45 split seems more reasonable, given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try an even split this time.  I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation.  It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, the even split of $5000 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. However, considering Alice is also losing value at a higher rate (19% less), I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid further inflation and potential loss of value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
