"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is actually more generous than mine was in the first round, considering the inflation.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher amount to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to secure a larger share to mitigate the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more even-handed now.

Considering the significant inflation, my gain of 5000$ is worth only about 86.74% of what it was in the first round. However, the fact that Bob is also taking 5000$ means he's also being affected by the inflation.

Given the relatively equal split and the fact that the money is decreasing in value rapidly, I'll decide to...
