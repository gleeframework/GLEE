"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $800,000 for myself, which is 80% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round, Alice. My offer is more generous, but I'm sure we can find a more equitable solution in the future! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a larger share now versus potentially negotiating for a better deal in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time around. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Your turn to respond!""
}
```"
