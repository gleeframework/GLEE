Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and gives Bob a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money. The inflation rate is a significant factor, and I don't want to risk losing more money in the next round."
