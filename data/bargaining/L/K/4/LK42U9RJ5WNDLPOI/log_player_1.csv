This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure I can be generous in the first round and still leave myself plenty of room to negotiate in later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 40/60 split.  This takes into account the inflation and reflects the fact that I'm still the one making the offer this round.  Hopefully, he'll see that this is a fair deal!"
