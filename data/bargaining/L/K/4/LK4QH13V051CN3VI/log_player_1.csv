"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the middle ground, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less, so the total amount is $9,500.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of meeting in the middle, and we'll both take $5,000."
