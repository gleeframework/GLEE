Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can find a more balanced split given the inflation rates.  Let's try a 60/40 split to account for the differing devaluation of the money.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation rates, but your offer doesn't feel balanced to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
