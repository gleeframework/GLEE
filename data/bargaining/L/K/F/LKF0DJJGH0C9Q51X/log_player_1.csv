"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can find a more balanced split given the inflation rates.  Let's try a 60/40 split to account for the differing devaluation of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
