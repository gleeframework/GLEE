"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer seems tempting, it's a risky move to accept right away.  There's a chance for a better deal. Plus, by rejecting, I get to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point.  Let's work from here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still taking the majority. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting progressively worse for me, and I'm starting to see a pattern. I'll keep rejecting to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""It's time for a 50/50 split. This is the fairest outcome considering the inflation, and it shows we're both willing to compromise.""}
```"
