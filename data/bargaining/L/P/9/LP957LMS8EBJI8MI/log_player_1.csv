"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point.  Let's work from here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of $4000, which is $3200, and Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 95% of $6000, which is $5700.

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, considering the initial proposal I made. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 60/40 split. I'll propose a 70/30 split, but I'm willing to listen to your counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% of what it was in the first round. My gain of $4000 is now worth 64% of $4000, which is $2560, and Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 90.5% of $6000, which is $5445.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still taking the majority. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70% share for myself, and a 30% share for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time for a 50/50 split. This is the fairest outcome considering the inflation, and it shows we're both willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $7000 is now worth 51.2% of $7000, which is $3584, and Bob's gain of $3000 is now worth 85.74% of $3000, which is $2568.41.

I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'm willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, a 50/50 split seems fair. Let's call it a day!""
}
```"
