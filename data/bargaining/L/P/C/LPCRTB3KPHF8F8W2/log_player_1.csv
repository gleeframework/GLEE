I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round, aiming for a 90/10 split in my favor.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting a 50/50 split in round 2 is a good compromise, especially considering the potential for further losses in future rounds."
