"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'm now considering a gain of 450,000 is actually worth 450,000 / 0.9 = 500,000 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 2.
