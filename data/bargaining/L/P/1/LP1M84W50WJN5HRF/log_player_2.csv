Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Alice's offer is still relatively close to the initial 50/50 split, but I'll try to squeeze a bit more. Here's my response:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating into my potential gains, I'll have to be even more cautious. Alice's offer is still a 60/40 split, which is a relatively reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
