Alice's offer:

It's a good starting point, but I'm not sure I can afford to wait that long.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
 
Let's see if Alice is willing to be more fair.  I think I deserve a slightly larger share to compensate for the time we've wasted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a good compromise, especially with inflation affecting my gains."
