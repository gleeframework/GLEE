900000.0,100000.0,"Let's split it 90-10, I'll get the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk too. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering we both have an equal chance to get the better end of the deal in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent chunk, but I still want the majority. You can't expect to get 55% just because you made the last offer!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be reasonable. We both know the money is losing value with each round, and we're both better off reaching an agreement now. I'm willing to increase my previous offer to 60% for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up the majority. You're getting a decent chunk, but I'm keeping the upper hand.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm starting to think you're not taking the inflation seriously. This is the last offer I'm making, and it's a fair one. We both get a decent chunk, and we avoid further losses. Accept this, or we'll both end up with significantly less.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm not going to let you dictate the terms. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm still taking the majority. You should have accepted my previous offers.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"This is it, Alice. I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I'm not going any higher. If you reject this, we'll both end up with nothing.  It's time to be reasonable, and stop holding onto a lost cause.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I'm not going to let you bully me into a bad deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still taking the majority. You should have accepted my previous offers when you had the chance.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, this is it.  The inflation is eating away at our potential gains with every round. We need to compromise, and I'm willing to take the vast majority. I won't go any higher, accept this or we both walk away with practically nothing. It's time to be realistic.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I'm not going to let you take advantage of me. It's time to split the remaining money 50-50. We both know the inflation is killing our potential gains, so let's just cut our losses and split it fairly.",Alice,11,
