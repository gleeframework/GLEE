"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when making my decision. With the offer of 60-40, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make up for the fact that the money is worth less for me.

I'll reject the offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in! Since the money is worth much less for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer. With the offer of 70-30, I'm getting a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob.

I'll think about it for a moment...
