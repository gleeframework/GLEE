"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the money evenly. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you lose value each round""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice loses 10% of the value each round, I'll try to take advantage of that and offer a slightly uneven split in my favor. Let's see if Alice accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait and see if I can get an even better offer. Alice is losing value each round, so she may be willing to compromise further in the next round. Let's proceed and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, I'll take a bigger share""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice has already lost 19% of the value, and will lose even more in the next round, I'll try to take advantage of that and offer an even more uneven split in my favor. Let's see if Alice is desperate enough to accept!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a lower share, but I need to secure something for myself. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's final offer and the fact that the money doesn't lose value for me, I think it's a good time to accept. I've managed to negotiate a better deal than the initial 50/50 split, and Alice is unlikely to offer more considering her losses due to inflation. Time to secure my 60!"
