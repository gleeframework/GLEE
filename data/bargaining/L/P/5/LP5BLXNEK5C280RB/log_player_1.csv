"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and take $600,000. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more generous now that the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him. It's a fair meeting in the middle."
