"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll reassess the offer.

My gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.
Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
