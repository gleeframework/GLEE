"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll get the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than before, so I'll have to consider that.

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $50, which is worth 95% of the initial $80 I could have gotten in the first round, due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
