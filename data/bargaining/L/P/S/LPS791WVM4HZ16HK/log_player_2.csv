"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm impacted more by inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather make a counteroffer in the next round and see if I can get a better deal. The 10% decrease in value for me is less than the 20% decrease for Alice, so I have some leverage. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing rapidly, Bob. Let's settle this quickly -  take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, especially for Alice, her offer seems more reasonable now. If I reject this offer and the game continues, the value will decrease even further. I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the first round, so it's wise to accept this offer before the money loses more value."
