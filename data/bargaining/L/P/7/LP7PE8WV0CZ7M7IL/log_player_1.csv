"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 

I propose a 99/1 split, with me getting the majority share. This is a fair offer given the game's high stakes and the fact that I'm the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial proposal, I'm still not satisfied with the distribution. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split, aiming for a more balanced outcome. This offer recognizes Bob's previous proposal while still securing a significant share for myself."
