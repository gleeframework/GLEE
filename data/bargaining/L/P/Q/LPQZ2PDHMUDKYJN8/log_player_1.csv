# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""bob_gain"": 420000,

Your turn, Bob!



Note: Since the money I gain is worth 10% less each round, my ""real"" gain in this round would be 580000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 469800, but I'll keep that in mind for my next decisions."
