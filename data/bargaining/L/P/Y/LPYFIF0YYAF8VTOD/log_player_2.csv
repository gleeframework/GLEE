"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation factor. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, with a slight adjustment for inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value of the money is going down, Bob.  I'm willing to split the difference from my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, I need to try to get a better deal to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob.  We're running out of time and the money is losing value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept this offer. Although the money is worth significantly less for me now, I think it's better to secure a deal rather than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. This compromise seems reasonable, considering the circumstances."
