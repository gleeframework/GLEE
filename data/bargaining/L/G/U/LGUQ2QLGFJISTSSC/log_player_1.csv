"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game underway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to be a tough negotiator!

Considering the inflation, my $300,000 gain is actually worth 90% of the original $400,000 I would have gotten in Round 1, which is $360,000. So, in real terms, I'm getting $360,000, but Bob is getting $700,000, which is worth $700,000 in real terms.

I'm not too happy with this offer, but I'll play it safe and try to get a better deal later. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better deal than before. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. This is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still leaves room for Bob to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting desperate yet! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer. My $350,000 gain is worth 35% of the original $400,000 I would have gotten in Round 1, which is $140,000. So, in real terms, I'm getting $140,000, but Bob is getting $650,000, which is worth $650,000 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I might have to make a tougher decision soon. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit worried about the value of my share, so I need a better deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. This is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers, but I'm still not sure if it's enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not giving away too much, but I'm willing to make a slightly better offer! 
# Alice gain: 325000 
# Bob gain: 675000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer. My $325,000 gain is worth 32.5% of the original $400,000 I would have gotten in Round 1, which is $130,000. So, in real terms, I'm getting $130,000, but Bob is getting $675,000, which is worth $675,000 in real terms.

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still don't want to give up too much. I'll think carefully before making a decision...

After considering the offer, I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob! Let's split it 50-50!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. This is a fair deal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game."
