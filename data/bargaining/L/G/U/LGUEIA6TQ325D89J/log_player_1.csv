"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very small offer for Bob, hoping he'll be willing to accept it early on to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk further inflation and getting less in the next round."
