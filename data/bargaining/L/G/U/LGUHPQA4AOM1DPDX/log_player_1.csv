Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 495000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice due to inflation.  Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message indicates this is his final offer.  Rejecting it likely means walking away with nothing.
* **Minimal Difference:** The difference between Bob's offer and Alice's last offer is relatively small. Accepting avoids a larger loss due to further inflation. 

While getting a slightly larger share in a previous round would have been ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 ensures Alice receives something and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
