Let's see what I can get!  I'll counter with a more favorable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair deal considering I'm taking the risk of going to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome considering the inflation and that I'm getting less than I initially asked for. It's better to take the money now than to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
