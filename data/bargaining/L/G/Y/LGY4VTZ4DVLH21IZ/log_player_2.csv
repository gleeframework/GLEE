Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 48/52, with me getting a slightly smaller share. This way, we can both get a decent amount before inflation eats away too much. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800
