"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

This is my initial offer. I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option.  Given the inflation, my potential gains in future rounds are significantly reduced, and there is no guarantee Bob will offer me more. It's a fair and reasonable deal in the current circumstances."
