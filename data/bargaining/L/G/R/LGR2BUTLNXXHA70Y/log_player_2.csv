"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is fair, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round, especially considering inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that you got the better end of the deal last round.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hit hard. Accepting this offer is the safest choice to secure a decent amount, especially given the chance Alice might offer an even worse deal next round."
