Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle considering the inflation""}\n\n### I'll take into account the inflation and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss, while still offering Bob a significant portion. Meeting in the middle should make the offer more appealing to Bob."
