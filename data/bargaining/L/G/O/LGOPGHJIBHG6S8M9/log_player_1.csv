Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my offer: I'll take 999,999$ and give Bob 1$. This is a very aggressive move, but I want to get as much as possible in the first round before the inflation hits!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation will drastically reduce my winnings in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least a decent amount, while rejecting it risks getting nothing in the following round."
