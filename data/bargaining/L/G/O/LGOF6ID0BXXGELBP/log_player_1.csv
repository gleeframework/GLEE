"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm effectively getting a worse deal than in the first round.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give up the opportunity to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance. You can either accept or walk away.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get the majority 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! Let's analyze it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than the first round, I'm effectively getting a better deal than in the first round, but a worse deal than in the third round.

I'll consider this offer and decide to accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
