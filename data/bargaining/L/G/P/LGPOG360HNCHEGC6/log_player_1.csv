"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept it.
