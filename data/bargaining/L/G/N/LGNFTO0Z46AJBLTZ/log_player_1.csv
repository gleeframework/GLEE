```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```
I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that tries to persuade him to accept this slightly unequal split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a slightly better split for me since I believe my input in the next round, should we fail to reach an agreement, will be valuable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
