"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since the money loses value faster for Bob, I'm being generous in hopes of ending this quickly. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being way too greedy.  I'll counter with a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split this time. It's a fair deal given the inflation rates.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away the whole pot!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy. I'll counter with a better offer in the next round. The inflation is starting to hit him hard, I need to keep pushing for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split.  I'm willing to meet halfway with Bob to avoid further losses from inflation. We both know the money is losing value quickly, so this is the most reasonable solution.  Let's hope he sees reason this time!"
