"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game now if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $900,000 I was offered in the first round is now worth $720,000. The $100,000 I offered to Bob is still worth $100,000.

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable offer. However, considering the inflation, I'd be giving up $480,000 ($500,000 / 1.2) and getting $500,000, which is a good deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
