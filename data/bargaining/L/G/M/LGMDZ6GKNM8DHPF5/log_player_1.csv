"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can avoid any potential conflict or negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 400,000$. However, the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, so he's actually getting 480,000$ in ""real"" terms.

Considering this, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think you can do better than that. I'll give you a chance to make a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too generous.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. I'll offer Bob a lower amount, but still a decent one, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more realistic, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting 300,000$. However, the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so he's actually getting 520,000$ in ""real"" terms.

Considering the significant drop in value of the money Bob gains, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I think I can do better than that. You're getting a pretty sweet deal here.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too generous.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the inflation. I'll offer Bob a lower amount, but still a decent one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, but I'm not there yet.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 200k, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking its toll on Bob's offer!

Let's analyze the numbers. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting 200,000$. However, the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so he's actually getting 323,000$ in ""real"" terms.

Considering the significant drop in value of the money Bob gains, I think I can do even better than this offer. I'll reject it and make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're really feeling the pinch, aren't you? I'm not going to take advantage of you now.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too desperate.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the inflation. I'll offer Bob a lower amount, but still a decent one.

However, I'll also take into account that Bob's previous offer was a bit too low, so I'll try to find a middle ground.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.""
