# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI think I can get a better deal than that. The difference is still quite significant, and I'm not willing to give in yet. Let's see what the next round brings!"

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nFinally, a fair offer! With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I think it's wise to accept the 50/50 split and secure my gain before it's too late."
