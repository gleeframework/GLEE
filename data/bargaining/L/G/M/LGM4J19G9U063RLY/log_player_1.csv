"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is more than fair considering the inflation and the fact that I get to make the next offer if you decline. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy and trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
