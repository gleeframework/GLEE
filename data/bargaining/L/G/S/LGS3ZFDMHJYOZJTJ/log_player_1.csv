"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. Let's see if you can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $6,000 * 0.8 = $4,800
Bob gain: $4,000 * 0.9 = $3,600

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a better deal than my initial proposal and seems fair considering the inflation. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
