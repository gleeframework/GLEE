"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole amount. Don't bother responding.""
}
```

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm trying to get the upper hand early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take most of the money, but you'll get something. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

I'll accept this offer.
