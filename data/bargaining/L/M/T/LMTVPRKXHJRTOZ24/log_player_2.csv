Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be stubborn, Bob. We're both losing money. 57-43 is a good split. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing. By continuing to reject and propose counter-offers that are slightly more in my favor, I'm hoping Alice will become more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and the potential winnings shrink."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

After several rounds of back and forth, offering a 50/50 split sends a clear message:

* **Fairness:** It eliminates any argument of bias or greed.
* **Urgency:**  With time (and money) running out, a quick resolution is crucial.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. She can accept a fair deal or risk both of us walking away with nothing as inflation eats away at the potential winnings."
