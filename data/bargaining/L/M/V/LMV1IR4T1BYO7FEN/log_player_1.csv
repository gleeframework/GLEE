"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leave $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll calculate my potential gain as a percentage of the original $100. 

In the second round, the total amount is $95 (100 * 0.95), and Bob's offer is 45% of that, which is $42.75.

I'll accept this offer.
