"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take the chance for fairness, now the offer is less generous. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and the offer is only getting worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer is getting worse, accepting now would mean Bob loses a significant amount of money to inflation. It's better to gamble on one more round. In the next round, Bob will be forced to accept a worse deal, but he'll still want to aim for a higher amount than 400,000 to minimize the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. The value is decreasing rapidly for Bob, and it's the last round he can make an offer. He needs to propose something that Alice might accept, knowing it's her last chance for a larger share than an even split. This offer is slightly in Alice's favor but significantly better than what she offered in Round 5."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. This is getting embarrassing for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is it.  Bob has no choice. If he rejects this offer, the inflation will eat even more of his potential gain, leaving him with an even worse deal. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting is the only logical choice left. Alice played the game well."
