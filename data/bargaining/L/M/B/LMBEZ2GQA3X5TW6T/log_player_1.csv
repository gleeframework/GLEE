"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also providing a substantial amount for Bob.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation and I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd prefer a different ratio. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
