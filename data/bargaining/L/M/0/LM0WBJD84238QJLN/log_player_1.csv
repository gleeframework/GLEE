Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decreased value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get an even bigger share. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly! I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
