Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm taking a bit more this round, but you'll still get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's analyze the situation:

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. While his offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the decreasing value of the money means he's getting a much better deal in real terms compared to his rejected offer in Round 1. 

* **Future Rounds:**  If I reject, I get to make the offer in Round 3. While the money will be worth less, I can propose a division where I gain more than Bob's current offer, even after accounting for inflation.

* **Risk:** There's always a risk Bob will keep proposing increasingly worse deals. However, the faster devaluation of the money for Bob (20% per round) puts more pressure on him to reach an agreement quickly. 

**Reasoning:** It's strategically better to reject Bob's offer. I have a good chance of securing a better deal in the next round, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""This offer accounts for the decreasing value, Bob. It's time to make a deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Advantage:** I'm still aiming for a larger share than Bob, leveraging the fact that the money devalues faster for him. 
* **Concession:** I've slightly reduced my initial demand from 6000 to 5800. While this might seem counterintuitive, it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and might make him more likely to accept before the money is worth even less.
* **Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes the need to reach an agreement soon, highlighting the ticking clock of the devaluation. This subtly adds pressure on Bob to accept."
