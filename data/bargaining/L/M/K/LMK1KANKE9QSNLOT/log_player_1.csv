"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair first offer, as it gives Bob a small amount to consider, but still leaves me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation makes my share worth less, it's still better than risking getting nothing in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer."
