"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as I'm only taking a slightly larger share, and Bob still gets a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, the 80/20 split is too drastic.  I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer than Bob's last proposal, and I am willing to compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, and I am not willing to accept such a disadvantageous split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Given the continued inflation and the fact that Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equal division, and I believe it's the best way to ensure that we both get a reasonable share of the money before it loses further value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, Bob's offer is far too lopsided in his favor. I'll take my chances with the next round and hope for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I propose a 40/60 split in Bob's favor. While inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, I'm willing to concede a larger share to Bob to avoid further losses. This offer represents a more equitable split than Bob's previous offers, and I hope he will accept it."
