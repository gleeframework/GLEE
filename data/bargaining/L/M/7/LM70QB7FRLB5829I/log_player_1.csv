"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a roughly equal share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We'll both have a good amount of money this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'd rather aim for a higher amount. I'll make a new offer in the next round. 

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll aim to get a bit more, considering the money is still worth the same for me. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
