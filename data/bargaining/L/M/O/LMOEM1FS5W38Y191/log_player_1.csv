Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's getting closer to a 50/50 split. The 48/52 split is still not ideal, but it's a compromise that I can live with. I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game."
