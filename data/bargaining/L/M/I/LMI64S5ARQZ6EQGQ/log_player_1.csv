"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This gives me a significant share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to keep him engaged in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my target for a good deal has increased. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk losing out on a significant amount. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
