I'm going for a high-stakes gamble here. Since we only have 12 rounds, and the value decreases significantly with each round, it's crucial to secure as much as possible early on. This offer gives Bob almost nothing but leaves me with the vast majority of the money.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one, but I have to reject. While I'm getting a significant amount, the value is still declining.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even split. The value is dropping rapidly, and it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for more. An even split ensures we both get a fair amount before the value deteriorates further."
