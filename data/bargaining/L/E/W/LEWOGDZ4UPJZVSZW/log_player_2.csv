Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was a bit too harsh, Bob. How about a 52/48 split? It's still in your favor considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
