"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly bigger share this round""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but still leaving room for compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a new one:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the big gap between our shares. Let's try again""}

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, hoping we can find a more balanced split""}

Let's see if Bob will accept this revised offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, hoping we can find a more balanced split""}

I'm proposing a 40:60 split, giving me $4,000 and leaving $6,000 for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer and accept it."
