Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think 55-45 is a bit more favorable to Bob. I'd rather aim for a more balanced split.
