"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  This offer is a compromise, and we need to settle this before time runs out.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  We need to reach an agreement soon! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
It's getting close to the wire and Bob's offer is becoming more reasonable. While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout before inflation eats away at Bob's potential gain, making him less likely to offer a fair deal in later rounds."
