Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming higher this round. This offer ensures a significant gain for me while still leaving you with a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting evenly is the fairest way. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While I aimed higher in the previous round, Alice's inflation is working against her. Accepting a 50/50 split now gives me the same amount I was offered in the first round, but Alice is getting significantly less value. It's a good outcome for me.
