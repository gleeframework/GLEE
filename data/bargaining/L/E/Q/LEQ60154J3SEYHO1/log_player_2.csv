**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings diminishes.  While her offer isn't terrible, we can likely squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us considering we're running out of time.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end. By increasing our ask slightly from the previous round, we're applying a bit more pressure on Alice. Highlighting the ""final offer"" aspect adds to the urgency and might push her to accept."
