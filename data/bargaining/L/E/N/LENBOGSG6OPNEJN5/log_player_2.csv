# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'll try to propose something in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's work together!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk myself. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round. Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
