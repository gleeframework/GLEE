Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I propose a 45/55 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a significant share and avoids the risk of losing everything as rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
