Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the growing effect of inflation, I'm willing to lower my share further to 55/45, but I expect a reasonable compromise from your side as well. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher split, considering the rapid inflation and the risk of getting nothing, accepting this offer seems like the most rational choice."
