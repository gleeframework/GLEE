"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly. 800k for you, 200k for me. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""That's quite greedy Alice! How about a more even split this time?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being more than fair, Bob. Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly impatient, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's better to hold out a little longer and hope she gets more reasonable. The inflation is hurting her more than it's hurting me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic. This is a fair offer, and we both lose if this drags on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous Bob, I'm offering you the same deal you just offered me, but reversed!  Take it before the money shrinks even more! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees I get something. Waiting any longer carries a significant risk that Alice will lowball me with an even worse offer, or the game will end with nothing for both of us."
