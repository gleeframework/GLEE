"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

I'm offering to divide the $100 evenly between us, with each of us getting $50."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'd rather get more now to compensate for the decrease in value. I reject Bob's offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, which is a bit more than the 50% I initially offered, but still leaves Bob with a decent share."
