Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer still gives you a significant amount. Let's be practical and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the deadline. This offer provides a more even split while still acknowledging the time pressure. Let's agree and avoid losing more value.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get at this point considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that time pressure is mounting, but she's using that to her advantage. While her offers have inched slightly closer to a more even split, they are still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering Bob's losses to inflation. It's a risky move, but Bob needs to hold firm to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but the value is rapidly decreasing for both of us. This offer is a genuine compromise â€“ it's the most balanced one yet. Let's settle this now and walk away with something substantial.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to signal a willingness to compromise, but also convey the urgency of the situation.  Offering a slightly more even split than his previous offer shows flexibility. The message emphasizes the rapidly diminishing value, which impacts both players, and positions this offer as the best chance for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is plummeting! This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is running out. While Alice's offer is still far from ideal, Bob's losses to inflation are becoming severe. Accepting a 420,000 split, though undesirable, is significantly better than risking a complete loss if no agreement is reached."
