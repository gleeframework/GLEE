"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of money will decrease for me with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a new one, it's the same as my original offer. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not a new offer, Bob. I'll make a new one. How about 550k for me and 450k for you?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a friendly challenge to see if Bob will accept a slightly more generous offer."
