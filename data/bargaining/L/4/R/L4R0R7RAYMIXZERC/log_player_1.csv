"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is now worth 10% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that as well.

I will reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
