I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. There's a lot of time left, and I can do much better!"

Alice is still offering too little. I'm holding out for a better deal.  There are still plenty of rounds left, and the inflation is starting to hurt Alice more than me."

I'm still not convinced.  We're in the middle of the game, and I think I can get a better deal.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer split."
