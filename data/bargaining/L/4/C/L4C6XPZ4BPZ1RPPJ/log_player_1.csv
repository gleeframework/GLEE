"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so I can avoid the inflation that will kick in next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer from round 2 was 40-60, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
