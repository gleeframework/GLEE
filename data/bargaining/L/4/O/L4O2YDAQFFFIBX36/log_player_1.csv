"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $95 for myself and give $5 to Bob. This is a fairly generous offer considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my initial offer in terms of raw dollars, it's important to remember the impact of inflation. My potential gain has been reduced by 5% due to inflation, making his offer less attractive. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation that's impacting me while also offering a more even split than my initial offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too unfavorable for me. While Bob's potential gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, my own potential gains have been reduced by over 14%. I'm not willing to accept such a drastically uneven split, especially considering the remaining rounds will only further diminish the value of my share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Given the significant impact of inflation, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option at this point, considering the losses we've both endured. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the current situation."
