"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial proposal
Given the rules of the game, the goal is to divide $10,000 between Alice (me) and Bob in such a way that the proposal is accepted before the 12 rounds are over, considering the inflation rate for Bob.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on Bob's decision
Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob with each passing round, he is incentivized to accept offers sooner rather than later. This means that with each round, Bob loses more value, but Alice does not.

### Step 3: Calculate the value of money for Bob in the next round
For Bob, in the next round (Round 2), the $10,000 would be worth 20% less, which means it would be worth $8,000 to him.

### Step 4: Determine a reasonable offer for Round 1
Considering Bob's perspective and the fact that he loses value with each round, a reasonable initial offer should slightly favor Alice but still be attractive enough for Bob to consider, given the decreasing value of money for him.

### Step 5: Decide on the proposal
Let's propose a division where Alice gets 60% and Bob gets 40% of the $10,000, with a message explaining the reasoning behind this division.

### Step 6: Format the proposal in JSON
The proposal will be formatted as follows:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair initial offer. Accepting now secures your value.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer
Bob's offer is to split the $10,000 evenly, with both Alice and Bob receiving $5,000. However, considering the inflation, Bob's $5,000 is now worth 20% less than in the first round, making it effectively $4,000 in value from the first round's perspective.

### Step 2: Consider the implications of accepting the offer
If Alice accepts this offer, she gets $5,000, but she might be able to get a better deal in the next rounds, given that Bob's portion of the money continues to devalue.

### Step 3: Consider the impact of proceeding to the next round
In the next round, the money will devalue further for Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept a less favorable offer. However, there is a risk that if the game continues too long without an agreement, both players might end up with nothing.

### Step 4: Decide on the response
Given the current offer and the potential for a better deal in the next rounds, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Re-evaluate the situation
Given that Bob's offer to split the money evenly was rejected, and considering the inflation impact on Bob's portion, Alice needs to make a new offer that takes into account the current state of the game.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value for Bob in Round 3
For Bob, in Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it is effectively worth 40% less than in Round 1. Therefore, if Bob were to receive $5,000 in Round 3, it would be equivalent to $3,000 in Round 1 value.

### Step 3: Determine a reasonable offer for Round 3
Considering the devaluation of Bob's portion and the need to incentivize him to accept an offer before further devaluation, Alice should make an offer that slightly adjusts the previous offer in Bob's favor but still recognizes the decreasing value of money for him.

### Step 4: Decide on the proposal
Let's propose a division where Alice gets 57% and Bob gets 43% of the $10,000, acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's portion and aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to him.

### Step 5: Format the proposal in JSON
The proposal will be formatted as follows:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Considering the ongoing inflation impact on your portion, this offer aims to find a mutually acceptable middle ground.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{5700}$"
