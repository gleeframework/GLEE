"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable division. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the inflation and adjust my offers accordingly in future rounds.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because a 40-60 split in his favor is not acceptable to me, especially considering that the money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know that you're ready for my next offer.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, I'll take into account the decreasing value of money for both of us when making my next proposal.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and offer a 55-45 split in my favor. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" indicates my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(I'll continue to adjust my offers according to the decreasing value of money for both of us.)"
