**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round.  Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share.  This offer is a compromise, giving me a reasonable amount while still being potentially acceptable to Alice given her previous proposals."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not afraid! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me.  Waiting any longer is incredibly risky. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in the next round, even if I manage to secure a slightly larger share. It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than risk ending up with a significantly worse outcome."
