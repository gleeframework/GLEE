Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer, even though it's slightly better for me than the last one. Alice's perception of the money's value is decreasing rapidly, giving me a stronger position as the rounds progress."
