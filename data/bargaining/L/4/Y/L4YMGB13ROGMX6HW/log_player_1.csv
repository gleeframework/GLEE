Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

This way, I'm still trying to get a decent share, but I'm also leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game."
