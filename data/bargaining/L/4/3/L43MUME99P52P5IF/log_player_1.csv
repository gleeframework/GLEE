"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable deal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable deal, considering I'm the one making the initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

After calculating the new values, I see that the money I'd gain is worth 90% of the original amount ($900,000), and the money Bob would gain is worth 80% of the original amount ($800,000).

I'm not happy with the huge disparity in the proposed split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer this time, hoping to do better in the next round.
