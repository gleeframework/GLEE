"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is designed to be fair while still giving me a significant portion of the money. It also leaves room for negotiation in the future if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

This time I'm offering Bob a bit more, but still keeping the majority for myself.  I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maximizing my share."
