"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 300k, and I'll take 700k. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time to be a bit more generous. I'm offering you 400000. It's a fair deal, and it allows us to avoid further negotiation and the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gains.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure it's the best deal for me. I'd rather try to get a better offer. I'll reject this proposal and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you 440k, and I'll take 560k. This way, we're both getting a decent share, and I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $440,000 and keeping $560,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
