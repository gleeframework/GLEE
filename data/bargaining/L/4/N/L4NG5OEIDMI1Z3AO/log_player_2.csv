"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the faster inflation rate against my potential gains.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a more even split, acknowledging your inflation rate but also considering the risk of further rounds and potential losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  It's clear we're both aiming for a larger share, but further delays only hurt us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
