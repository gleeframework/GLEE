Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I'm hoping Bob will be intimidated by the potential for inflation and accept the offer. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from the first round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll take advantage of the fact that inflation is hurting Bob more than it is hurting me.  Let's see what I can do in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000 dollars, a little more than his last offer, but still keeping the majority for myself.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than nothing, especially with the increasing effects of inflation.  Let's see if he bites!"
