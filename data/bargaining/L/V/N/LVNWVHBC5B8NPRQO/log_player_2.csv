"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less in each round.  While the offer isn't ideal, it's important to consider that the money will continue to lose value.
* **Previous Rejection:** Alice rejected a very favorable offer in Round 2. This suggests she's willing to gamble and might reject further offers.
* **Potential Outcome:** If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Alice will offer me even less in the next round, making the situation worse. 

By accepting, I secure a small but certain gain, considering the current value of the money and the potential for a worse offer in the future."
