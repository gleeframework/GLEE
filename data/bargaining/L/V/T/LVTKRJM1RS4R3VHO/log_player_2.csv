This is a tough one, but it's time to cut my losses. Here's why:

* **Inflation is Eating My Share:**  At this rate, another round means my potential winnings decrease significantly.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Her last message implied this is her final offer. Holding out for a better deal in Round 6 is very risky.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While not ideal, 450,000 is still a significant sum, even with the inflation impact. 

It's painful to accept less than what I believe is fair, but sometimes you need to secure a win, even if it's less than perfect."
