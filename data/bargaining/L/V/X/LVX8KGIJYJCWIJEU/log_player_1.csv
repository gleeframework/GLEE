"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $5500, which is slightly more than half, and let Bob have $4500. The message ""Let's share fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and cooperation, hoping he will accept the offer and we can both walk away satisfied, considering the looming threat of inflation that decreases the value of the money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This accounts for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the inflation adjustment, Bob's proposal gives him a significantly larger share ($5250) compared to what I offered him in the first round ($4500), while my share ($4750) is less than what I initially proposed for myself ($5500). Considering the impact of inflation, I believe there's room for a more balanced division that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us, but particularly for me, as I'm affected more by inflation. I'll aim to make a counteroffer that better reflects these considerations in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the effects of inflation from the previous rounds. Given that the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I've adjusted my proposal to aim for a more balanced division. By offering $5200 for myself and $4800 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, while still aiming for a relatively fair split. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway"" is meant to convey my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution, considering the devaluing of the money over the rounds."
