"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can negotiate more evenly in the next round if you accept.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but it wasn't quite fair. How about this split instead?  Consider that your share is worth less each round we play.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point about inflation. Let's try this: I'll take 40, and you take 60.  This way, we both get a decent share and can avoid the continued devaluation of my earnings. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
