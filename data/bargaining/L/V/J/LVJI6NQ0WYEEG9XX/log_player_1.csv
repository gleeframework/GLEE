"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's work together to find a good solution. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the fact that Bob is proposing a 60-40 split again, even though he's the one making the offer this time.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping Bob will make a more competitive offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to get a better deal by proposing a 55-45 split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
