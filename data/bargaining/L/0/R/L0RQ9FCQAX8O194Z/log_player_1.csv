"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. We can discuss further if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a relatively straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
