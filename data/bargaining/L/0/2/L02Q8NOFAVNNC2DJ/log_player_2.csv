Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the time pressure is mounting, accepting a deal where I get less than 50% isn't ideal. The inflation is hurting, but I'm hoping Alice will become more reasonable rather than risk getting nothing at all."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging, you're losing value! 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Accepting Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is the only logical choice to avoid walking away with nothing. 

Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, my potential gains shrink dramatically. Accepting $41 now is significantly better than potentially receiving nothing in a few rounds.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Her message and consistent offers indicate she's unlikely to budge. Holding out for a better deal is highly risky at this stage.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but taking the $41 ensures I at least receive something for my participation."
