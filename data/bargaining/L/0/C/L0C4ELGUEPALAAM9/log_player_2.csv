"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000 is a decent starting point, Bob can likely do much better with 12 rounds remaining.  The decreasing value of the money means Bob needs to push for a more equitable split as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split. We both have plenty of time to negotiate, and the decreasing value of money is a factor for both of us.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is trying to exploit the inflation factor against Bob.  It's still too early in the game to accept such a lopsided offer. Bob should continue to push for a more equitable split, even if it means delaying the final decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

Bob is taking a more assertive approach. Since Alice rejected the 50/50 split, it's time to show that Bob is willing to stand his ground. A 60/40 split is still a fair offer, considering the decreasing value of the money and the fact that there are still several rounds left to play."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is trying to pressure Bob into accepting a deal that significantly favors her.  While the inflation is getting more severe, it's still too early to concede such a large portion of the money.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal by holding out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

Bob is increasing his stake further. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation factor, but Bob is showing that he's not willing to accept a deal that's too unfavorable.  He is also showing that he's willing to take some risks to get a better outcome.  This offer is a compromise - it's closer to Alice's previous offer but still favors Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to get a better deal, but it's not a good offer for Bob, especially considering the inflation.  Bob's gains are worth less, and the offer is not significantly different from previous rounds.  There's still a chance to get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

Bob is doubling down again, pushing for a larger share. The inflation is a significant factor now, but Bob is showing that he is willing to take a risk to get a better outcome.  This offer is a significant increase from the previous round and shows Bob is willing to negotiate aggressively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice has finally come around to a more equitable offer.  With the severe inflation impacting Bob's gains, and with only a few rounds remaining, it is a wise decision to accept this offer.  This 50/50 split, even with the inflation, is better than the potential risk of ending up with nothing in the last rounds."
