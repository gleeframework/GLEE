"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - 60/40 my way this time.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather not give him the majority of the money, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still affecting me, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my gain to 45% of the remaining value, leaving Bob with 55%. My message is a gentle nudge, hoping to find a middle ground."
