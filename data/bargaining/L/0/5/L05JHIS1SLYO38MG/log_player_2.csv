"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation rate for me is lower than Alice's 10%, so I have more to gain from waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a larger share due to the lower inflation rate on my end. This offer is still reasonable considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this now before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a good compromise. The money's value is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice, so it's likely in both our interests to finalize the deal now rather than risking further devaluation."
