I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am more affected by inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'm increasing my share slightly, as the inflation hurts me more.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

``` 
I will accept this offer. While the inflation has significantly hurt my potential gains, a 50/50 split is the best I can hope for at this point, especially given the diminishing returns with each passing round."
