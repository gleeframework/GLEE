"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm giving Bob a chance to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 20$ is now worth 16$ (80% of 20$), and Bob's gain of 80$ is now worth 76$ (95% of 80$).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal from Bob. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""A compromise. I'm willing to give you more, but I need some too.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual values: my gain of 30$ is now worth 15.24$ (48.8% of 30$), and Bob's gain of 70$ is now worth 65.1$ (85.74% of 70$).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure if I should wait for another proposal. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'll get a better deal in the next round.
