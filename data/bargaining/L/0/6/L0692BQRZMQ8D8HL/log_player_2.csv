"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 300,000 for me and 700,000 for her, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher amount for myself. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 320000, ""alice_gain"": 680000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, Alice's offer is a bit more favorable to me this round. I'll accept this offer.
