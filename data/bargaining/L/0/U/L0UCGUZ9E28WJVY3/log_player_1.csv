"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose to take 900,000$ and let Bob take 100,000$. I want to secure a large portion early on, as inflation will impact me more with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though my share is significantly smaller than my initial proposal, accepting this offer is the best option. Due to inflation, my share in the next round would be worth even less, and it's uncertain if Bob would offer me anything at all.  A 500,000$ share is still a substantial amount."
