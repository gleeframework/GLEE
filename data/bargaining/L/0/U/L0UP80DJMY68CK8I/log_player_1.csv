Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a very risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by the higher initial gain and accept it. It's a gamble, but I'm aiming for the majority of the money right off the bat!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite and I don't want to risk losing even more. Accepting this offer ensures a decent amount for me, even with the inflation."
