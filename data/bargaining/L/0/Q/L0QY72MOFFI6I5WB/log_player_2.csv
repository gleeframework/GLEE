Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the game's initial conditions and the outcome of the first round.
We are playing a game where $100 needs to be divided between two players, Alice and Bob. In the first round, Alice proposed a division where she takes $90 and Bob takes $10, justifying it as a ""fair split"" because she made the first offer. However, this offer was rejected by Bob.

### Step 2: Analyze the implications of inflation in the game for both players.
For each round that passes, the value of the money remains the same for Bob (0% inflation) but decreases by 5% for Alice. This means that with each passing round, Alice loses the value of her potential gain, while Bob's potential gain remains constant in value.

### Step 3: Determine a strategic approach for Bob's offer in Round 2.
Given the inflation dynamic, Bob has leverage because the value of the money does not decrease for him but does for Alice. A strategic approach for Bob would be to make an offer that still favors him but is slightly more generous than Alice's initial offer, to tempt Alice into accepting before the value of her potential share decreases further due to inflation.

### Step 4: Calculate a specific offer based on the strategic approach.
Considering the need to be more generous than Alice's initial offer but still benefiting from the game's structure, Bob could offer himself a larger share than Alice initially offered him but less than what Alice offered herself, to demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still leveraging the inflation mechanic.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message in the required JSON format.
Given the strategic considerations, Bob decides to offer himself $60 and Alice $40, with a message explaining his reasoning as a compromise that considers the game's inflation mechanic.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I propose a compromise where I take $60 and you take $40. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and you lose less to inflation.""}"
