"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too skewed towards Bob's gain, I want a better balance!""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm still looking for a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking for a more even split, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! My gain is now worth a significant amount less.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too skewed towards Bob's gain, I want a fairer split!""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise."
