"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to negotiate a good deal for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates in mind, I'm not as eager to accept a 40% share as I was before. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, I'd like to see a more equal split considering the inflation""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates and the fact that I'm worth 10% less than I was in the previous round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to protect my share from the inflation""
}
```"
