"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'll take $600,000 and Bob will take $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to consider that when making my decision. In the second round, the money is worth 80% of its original value, so Bob's offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 300000 * 0.8 = 240000
Bob gain: 700000 * 0.8 = 560000

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value in the third round (80% of 80%), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This means I'll take $480,000 and Bob will take $520,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round:

Alice gain: 450000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.488) = 873984.62
Bob gain: 550000 / 0.516 = 1066.67

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 51.6% of its original value in the fifth round (48.8% of 80% of 80%), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000
}
```"
