"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my initial offer. I think it's fair, but I'm open to discussion. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Given the inflation rate, this is a generous offer for you."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more balanced split, accepting this offer would still give her a significantly larger portion after accounting for inflation.  I need to hold firm and aim for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. However, time is literally money in this scenario. I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is a fair compromise considering the significant impact of inflation on your potential gains."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Alice. This puts pressure on her to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
* **Strategic Concession:** By slightly increasing my offer from the previous round, I'm showing a willingness to compromise, which could encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Highlighting Inflation:**  I continue to emphasize the impact of inflation on Alice's share, hoping she recognizes the advantage of accepting a deal now rather than risking a smaller payout later."
