"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a bigger share. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but I'm still trying to get a bigger chunk of the reduced-value money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting even scarcer! With the reduced value, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bigger share. However, Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower-value money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
