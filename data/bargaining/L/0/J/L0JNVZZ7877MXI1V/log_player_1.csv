"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. We can discuss further if you want.""
}
```

This offer is a 4:1 ratio, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can give me 60. It's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 32 (80% of 40).

I don't think this offer is a good compromise for me, as I'd be getting less than I proposed in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is not good enough. I'll propose a counteroffer: 45 for me, 55 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to the 20% inflation twice, my gain of 45 is actually worth 18 (40% of 45).

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll be generous and offer you 75. I'll take 25. Hope you accept this time!""
}
```"
