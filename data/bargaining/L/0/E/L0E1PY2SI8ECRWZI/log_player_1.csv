"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You'll get $100,000, a nice chunk of change. I'll get the rest, but we can call it a day and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the fairest way to divide the money, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob!

I accept his proposal. It's a 50-50 split, and it's a reasonable compromise. I'd rather not risk waiting for a better offer and risk losing everything.
