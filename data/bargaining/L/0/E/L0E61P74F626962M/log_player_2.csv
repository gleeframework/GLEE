"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob and I'm going to try to get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script from last round. I think this is a fair split for the second round. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? 55/45 seems fair given we're losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it! While I'd still prefer a 60/40 split, it's better to secure something than risk losing it all to inflation."
