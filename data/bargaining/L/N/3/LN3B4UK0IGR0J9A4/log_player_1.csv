"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you take 40. My turn to make the offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I would be getting only 40% of the total amount. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still try to get a bit more for myself""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a bit more for myself."
