"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation rates.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Bob's offer might seem tempting at first, it heavily favors him in the long run. I'm losing value faster, but holding out for a better deal is crucial."
