Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 51 dollars for myself and give 49 dollars to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I would have preferred to get 51,  a 5% decrease is still worth taking considering Bob's offer is worth 20% less for him.  It's a good deal in this round, and we've already lost some value due to inflation."
