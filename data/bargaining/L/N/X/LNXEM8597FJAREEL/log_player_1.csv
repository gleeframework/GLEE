Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value fast, I'm not backing down now. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500

{

}
```

This is a tough decision, but it's getting too risky.  Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:** The 67.23% inflation is brutal. My potential gains are shrinking fast with each round.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** He seems determined to exploit the situation. Waiting longer might lead to even worse offers.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While 35% isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round and potentially getting a worse offer, or even nothing at all."
