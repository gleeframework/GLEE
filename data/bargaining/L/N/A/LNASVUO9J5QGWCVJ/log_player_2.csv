Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a better deal than your last offer. Let's try to find a middle ground.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but it's still a relatively fair deal. Inflation is starting to hurt me!""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end here.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  It's the only way we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I'll explain my reasoning:

Since the money I gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, the actual value of the $5000 I would gain is approximately $4072.50. However, considering the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I think it's better to accept the offer and secure the $4072.50 rather than risking getting nothing.

Additionally, since Alice's gain is not affected by inflation, she has less incentive to compromise, and it's possible that she might not offer a better deal in future rounds. Therefore, I think accepting the even split is the best decision at this point."
