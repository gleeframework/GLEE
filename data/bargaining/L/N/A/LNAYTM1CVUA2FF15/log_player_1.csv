I'm not satisfied with the 50/50 split. I was hoping for a better deal, especially since I'm getting hit harder by inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

I think I've been negotiating for long enough, and the inflation is taking a significant toll on my end. I'm willing to accept this offer, even though I was hoping for a better deal. The 60-40 split is still better than the 50-50 split Bob initially proposed, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
