"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to give it all away! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's early in the game, and Alice is offering a relatively small amount to Bob.  It's worth seeing if a better deal can be negotiated, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I think a 60/40 split is reasonable, given the potential for inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bigger share this round. Let's see if you agree! 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and Alice's offer is better than the 36% loss I'd face if I reject and go to the next round. It's best to secure a decent amount while I can."
