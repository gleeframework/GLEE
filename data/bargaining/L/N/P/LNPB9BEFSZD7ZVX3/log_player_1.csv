"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! He's trying to split it down the middle. But I'm not going to give up that easily.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for me to make another move!

Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now (due to 10% inflation in the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, that inflation is biting! Okay, let's calculate the actual value of the money now... 

Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after the first round, and 72.9% after the second round, it's now worth 72.9% * 90% = 65.61% of its original value.

So, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 45 * 65.61% ≈ 29.47
Bob gain: 55 * 65.61% ≈ 36.13

Hmm, not a bad offer, but I'm not going to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time to make another move!

Since the money is worth 65.61% of its original value now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This time, I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will finally accept!"
