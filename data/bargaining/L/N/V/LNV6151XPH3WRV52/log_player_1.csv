"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, I'll gain $5,000, which is 50% of the total, and Bob will gain $4,000, which is 40% of the total.

Since the 50/50 split is now more favorable to me due to the reduced value of money, I'll accept Bob's offer.
