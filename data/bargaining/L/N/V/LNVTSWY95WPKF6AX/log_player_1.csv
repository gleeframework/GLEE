"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. The message is a bit of a taunt, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to be reasonable, but he's still trying to get the better deal.

I'll reject his offer. The money is still worth a lot, and I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite fair, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll aim for a higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it closer to 50/50. We both lose money if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll reject his offer. I'm still hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is worth less with each passing round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there, Bob. I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less now, I'll aim for an even higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""bob_gain"": 425000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob. Meet me at 57.5/42.5 and let's wrap this up.""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, Alice. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit desperate, and I'm not sure if he's willing to compromise anymore.

I'll accept his offer. Splitting it evenly at this point is probably the best I can get, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
