I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I think this is a fair initial offer, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split.  Given the inflation and that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for both of us, this is the best offer I've received so far.  It's time to stop risking a worse outcome."
