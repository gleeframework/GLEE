"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a generous 10% of the total, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, which is fair considering the game's rules, and I'll leave Bob with 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I'm not giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 600000 * 0.95 = 570000 (due to 5% inflation)

I'll reject this offer because it's not as generous as I'd like, and I'd rather negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation from the previous rounds and gives Bob a slightly larger share than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not backing down. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: 450000 * 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = 232220 (due to 48.8% inflation)
Bob's gain: 550000 * 0.8557 (1 - 0.1443) = 470,185 (due to 14.26% inflation)

I'll reject this offer because it's still not generous enough, and I'd like to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation and tries to find a middle ground between my previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: 500000 * 0.3317 (1 - 0.6683) = 166350 (due to 67.23% inflation)
Bob's gain: 500000 * 0.7778 (1 - 0.2222) = 388900 (due to 22.62% inflation)

I'll accept this offer because it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going further into the rounds with decreasing values.
