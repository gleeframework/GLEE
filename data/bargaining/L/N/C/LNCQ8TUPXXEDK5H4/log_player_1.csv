I propose a 99/1 split, with me receiving 990,000 and Bob receiving 10,000. This is a generous offer, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's a significant improvement from the first round, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'm aware of the inflation factor, but I'm confident I can get a larger share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose an 80/20 split, with me receiving 800,000 and Bob receiving 200,000. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor, and I believe it is a good compromise that will allow us both to secure a decent share of the money."
