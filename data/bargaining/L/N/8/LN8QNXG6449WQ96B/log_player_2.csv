"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept, but it's too early in the game. I can likely get a better deal if I wait and make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal considering the inflation, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my initial offer is looking more reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a bigger share since the money is losing value faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal split.  While the inflation hurts, I'm not sure I can get a better deal, and it's getting risky to wait any longer."
