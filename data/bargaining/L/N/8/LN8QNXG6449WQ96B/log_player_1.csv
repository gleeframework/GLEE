Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm making the first offer.""

```

Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal considering the inflation, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
