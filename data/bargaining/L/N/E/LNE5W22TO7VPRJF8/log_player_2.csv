Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Alice's offer is a 50/50 split. Since my gains are worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. However, I'll still consider the fact that Alice's gains are worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly higher to account for the decreased value of the money. I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for the loss in value.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, my gains are worth even less, and Alice's gains are worth significantly less as well. Since Alice's offer is now 60/40, I'll consider it a relatively favorable split, especially since my gains are worth less due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
