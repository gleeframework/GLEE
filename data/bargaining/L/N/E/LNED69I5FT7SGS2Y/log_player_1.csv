"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $100,000 is now worth $90,000 (since $100,000 * 0.9 = $90,000).

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering I'm only getting a small fraction of the total. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the total, but I'm not going to give up much more than that.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'll take what I can get 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain of $50,000 is now worth $36,350 (since $50,000 * 0.731 = $36,350).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer, hoping that the inflation will work in my favor.
