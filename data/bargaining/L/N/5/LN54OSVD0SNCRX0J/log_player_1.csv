"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving me a larger share but still offering Bob a significant amount. This is a reasonable starting point considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is more favorable to him, it's still significantly less than what I was initially aiming for. The inflation factor makes it riskier to accept a low offer, hoping for a better one in the next round.  I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, still giving myself a majority but offering Bob a reasonable increase from his previous offer. The inflation factor is making things harder, so I need to secure a deal quickly, but I'm not willing to completely cave in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting both of us. Bob's offer, although less than ideal, provides a decent amount considering the circumstances. Accepting this offer ensures I receive some money before the inflation further diminishes the value of the pot."
