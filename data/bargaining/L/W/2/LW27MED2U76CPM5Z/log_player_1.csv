"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me now!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I'll have to be even more careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair split, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly now!

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd rather try to negotiate for a bit more.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not split it evenly. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer. Let's settle this before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly now!

Considering the huge difference in value between our offers, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer that may never come.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll take the smaller share. Let's end this before it's too late!""
}
```"
