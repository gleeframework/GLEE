"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a fair split, 60/40 in my favor.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45. We both benefit from ending this sooner rather than later.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
