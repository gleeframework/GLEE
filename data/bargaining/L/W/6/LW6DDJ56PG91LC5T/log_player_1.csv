"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $3000 is actually $2400 in real value.

I'm not too thrilled with the 3:7 split, but I'll consider it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the second round), I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the first round, my gain of $2000 is actually $1050 in real value.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a 20:80 split, and I think I can do better. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.
