"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'll be making the offer next round. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of the original value, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of the original value.

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I think I can do better next round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, and 90% of the original value, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60-40 split, but I'm not willing to give you that much. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still leaves room for negotiation."
