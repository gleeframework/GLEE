"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unfair to me.  I'm willing to split a little closer to even, but I need a larger share to account for the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
