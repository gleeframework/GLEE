"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a very unequal split, knowing Bob will likely reject it.  This is a strategy to gauge his risk tolerance and how he values the potential future gains of making an offer himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more even than my initial one, but I'm still confident I can do better. Since my money is losing value faster than Bob's, I want to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from the previous round, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. This should be appealing enough to incentivize him to accept while still leaving me with a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of the money I gain is significantly reduced due to inflation, I'm forced to accept this offer. Bob's offer is more favorable to him, and if I reject it, I risk losing even more in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and accept this deal."
