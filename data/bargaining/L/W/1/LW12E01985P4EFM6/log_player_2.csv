Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split.  It's fair given the inflation, and we can finally move on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
