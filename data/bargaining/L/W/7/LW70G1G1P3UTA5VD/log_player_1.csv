"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1, and I know that the money I gain is worth 5% less now, I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to give you 45 dollars, and I'll take 55 dollars."
