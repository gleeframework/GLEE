"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'll get 70 dollars, and Bob will get 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than before. Since Bob's offer is still higher than my initial offer, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
