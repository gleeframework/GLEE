Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer accounts for inflation and gives you a good amount. Let's end this before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I'm betting she'll become more amenable to a fairer split as the rounds progress."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out here.  This is a final compromise, let's split it before things get even worse.  We can still walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, as Alice is clearly getting anxious. However, her offer is still  tilted in her favor, even considering the inflation. I'm willing to push my luck a bit more.  A 50/50 split is feeling less likely, but I think I can still secure a better deal than this."
