Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can both do a little better. I propose we split it 55/45 in my favor. This will give us both a slightly larger share than your initial proposal, and it feels fairer to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
