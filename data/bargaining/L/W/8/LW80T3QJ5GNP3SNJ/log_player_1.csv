"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in ending the game early and accepting my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $4,500 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the fairest way, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so the $10,000 is now equivalent to $9,000 in the first round's value.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all the power. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
