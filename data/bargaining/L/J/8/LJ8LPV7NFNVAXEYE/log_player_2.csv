"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want a better deal. 300,000 is too low, especially considering the inflation.  Let's see what Alice has to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. I think this is the fairest way to divide the money, and it's a good way to avoid any further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. I'm adjusting my offer slightly, but time is running out for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not fair considering the inflation. I will take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's compromise. I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split, but I'm not going lower. This offer reflects the inflation and gives us both a good share.""}
