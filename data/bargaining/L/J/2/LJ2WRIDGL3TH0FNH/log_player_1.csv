Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""This offer is based on the initial value of the money. As it decreases in value with each round, it's important to consider the diminishing worth. I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio, favoring Bob slightly to account for the decrease in value over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Your previous offer was too skewed in your favor. I'm offering a more balanced split this time, considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
