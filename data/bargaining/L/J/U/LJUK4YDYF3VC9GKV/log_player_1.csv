Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, 55/45 is still quite fair. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. I need to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my initial demand slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on a larger share for myself.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob to accept. He knows if he rejects this, the value will decrease further for both of us in the next round."
