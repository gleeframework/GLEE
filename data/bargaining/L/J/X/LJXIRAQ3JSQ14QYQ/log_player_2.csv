Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but not too much 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is consistently offering slightly more than half, and the inflation is eating into the potential gains. While the difference is getting smaller, it's worth holding out a little longer to see if I can get a better deal or if Alice will become more reasonable as the rounds progress."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The rounds are progressing, and inflation is steadily eroding the value of the money. While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's getting closer to an even split. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas holding out risks getting a worse deal or even losing everything if we don't reach an agreement in time."
