"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair considering the money loses value quickly.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The most crucial factor is the decreasing value of the money.  While a 50/50 split seems ""fair"" in a vacuum, Bob has a lower depreciation rate (5% vs. my 20%). Delaying benefits him more than it benefits me.
* **First Mover Advantage:** By making the first offer, I set the tone. Offering a slightly higher amount to myself (60%)  might make Bob more likely to accept, knowing things only get worse for me as time goes on. 
* **Future Rounds:** If Bob rejects this offer, I know he's aiming for a much larger share.  This gives me valuable information to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous one from his perspective, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor considering the inflation rates.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that the money devalues faster for me.  

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Accepting this sets a bad precedent. Bob sees I'm willing to move closer to a 50/50 split, even though the longer the game goes on, the worse it gets for me. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better in the next round.
* **Calculated Risk:** While I lose another 20% of value by rejecting, Bob also loses 5%. This makes him slightly more likely to propose a fairer deal in the next round as the shrinking pot affects him more. 

I need to show Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to play the long game to a certain extent."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we both lose with every round. This offer is fair considering the depreciation. Don't let greed get the best of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my original offer (6000 down to 5800) to signal that I'm willing to negotiate. However, this concession is much smaller than the one Bob offered (from 4000 to 4500). 
* **Highlighting Shared Losses:** I'm emphasizing that every round hurts both of us. This aims to nudge Bob towards a quicker resolution and away from trying to squeeze every last dollar.
* **Framing and Anchoring:** I'm framing my offer as ""fair"" and his potential rejection as driven by ""greed.""  This psychological tactic subtly shifts the perception of what's reasonable in this situation. 

This offer balances firmness with a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution before the shrinking pie makes a reasonable agreement impossible."
