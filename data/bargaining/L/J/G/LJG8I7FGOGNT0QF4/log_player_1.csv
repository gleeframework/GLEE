"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
