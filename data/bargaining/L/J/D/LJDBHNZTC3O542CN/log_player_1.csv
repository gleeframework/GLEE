"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both get some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $400,000. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth the same for him as it was in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not sure if splitting it 50/50 is fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take this offer and we can both get a decent share of the money!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not sure if it's good enough for him."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth only 30.4% of what it was in the first round, which is $304,000 in nominal terms. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth the same for him as it was in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not happy with this offer, especially since Bob is taking the lead. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough for him. I'm trying to leave some room for negotiation, but I'm also trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get something! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential gain. With the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is worth only 10% of what it was in the first round, which is $100,000 in nominal terms. I'm not happy with this offer at all, especially since Bob is taking the majority of the money. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a huge bite out of my potential gain, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my offer. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50000,
  ""bob_gain"": 950000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last stand, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm basically offering Bob 95% of the money, but I'm hoping he'll accept it since I'm offering him a significant amount. I'm trying to maximize my own gain, but I'm also leaving him with a substantial amount."
