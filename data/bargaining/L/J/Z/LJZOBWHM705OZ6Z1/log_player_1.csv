"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to get a larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
