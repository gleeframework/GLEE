Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking almost all the money for myself, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a bold opening move to see if he's willing to accept a highly unequal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is being just as bold as me! I will reject his offer and move on to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose an even split.  This is a more fair offer, and it might encourage Bob to compromise in the future rounds."
