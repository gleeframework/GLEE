Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a bigger share this time. I think a 70/30 split is fair, considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
