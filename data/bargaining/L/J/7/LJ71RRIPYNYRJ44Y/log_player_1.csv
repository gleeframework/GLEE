I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with me receiving $400,000 and Bob receiving $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'm offering you 300k, which is still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a better deal considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
