"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something rather than risking getting nothing if we don't divide the money in time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, huh? That's a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up too much. However, considering the time constraint and the fact that the money is worth 0% less for me, I think I'll accept this offer.
