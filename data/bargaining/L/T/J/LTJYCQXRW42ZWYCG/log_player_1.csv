"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time. A 55/45 split seems like a good starting point. We both get a decent amount, and it's a good foundation for future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
