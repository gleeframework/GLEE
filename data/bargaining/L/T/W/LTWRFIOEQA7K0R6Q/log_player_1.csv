"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to get the majority of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, I would be getting $80,000 (20% of $100,000) and Bob would get $720,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
