"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is much less than my previous offer, it's still better than the 36% loss I'm facing due to inflation. It's better to accept and get something than to risk losing even more in the next round."
