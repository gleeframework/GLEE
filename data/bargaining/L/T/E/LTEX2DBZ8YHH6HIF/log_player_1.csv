"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, but I'll take the larger share this time.""}

I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $300,000. I'm looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing that we split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
