"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. We can reassess if you don't like it.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share as the first mover."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I want a bigger piece of the pie. You can reconsider my offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so the numbers are now:

* Alice gain: $2,000
* Bob gain: $8,000

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as I'd like to get a larger share, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a smaller share. I'll take $4,500 and you can have $5,500. Let's finalize the deal?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to balance my gain with the reduced value of the money."
