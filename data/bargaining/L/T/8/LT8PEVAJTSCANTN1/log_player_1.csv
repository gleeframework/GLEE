I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's better to get half now than to risk getting less later.  Let's take the even split!"
