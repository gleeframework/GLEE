"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. This is a good deal for both of us, as the money is losing value with every round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to push for a more equitable split before the inflation eats away at the value too much."
