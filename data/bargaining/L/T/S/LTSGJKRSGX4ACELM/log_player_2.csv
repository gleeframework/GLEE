**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial potential gain due to inflation.  Bob's counter-offers have been reasonable, and he needs to continue pushing for a more equitable split.  There's still time, but he needs to convey urgency in the next round."
