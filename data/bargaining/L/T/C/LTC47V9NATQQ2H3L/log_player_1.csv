Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. No need for further rounds and we both get a fair deal.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation affects Bob's gain, so he might be more willing to compromise. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of the inflation affecting Bob's gain. Since the money is worth 10% less for him now, he might be more willing to accept a slightly worse deal. I'll offer him a bit less than before, but still try to make it look like a fair deal.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair compromise""}\n\nLet's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
