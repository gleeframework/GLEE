Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small advantage for me, but I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a larger share of the money in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair for Bob to take 80% of the money in the first round. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take a larger share of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that still gives Bob a 60% share. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```

I'm trying to be clear that I'm not happy with the offers I've been getting, and I'm looking for a more significant concession from Bob."

# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I'll still give you a chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 70% share of the money. This is getting ridiculous, and I think it's time for me to make a final, strong offer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not willing to give up 90% of the money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the last chance to make a move, and I'm going all in 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is going for broke! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let Bob take 90% of the money. This is an unacceptable offer, and I'm willing to risk leaving with nothing rather than accept it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you take everything. I'll give you a tiny bit more than 50%, but that's it.""

Do you accept this offer?","It's the final round, and Bob is making one last attempt to take it all. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let Bob take 99.99% of the money. I'd rather leave with $1000 than accept this offer. It's a small consolation prize, but it's better than nothing."
