"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should start with a 60-40 split in my favor, as the next round I'll have to account for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get a bigger share upfront. But I'm not going to give in that easily!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. The inflation is already affecting my gains, and I don't want to give up too much too soon.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so now I'll have to be more careful with my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair split. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 460,000, and keeping 540,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is more to his liking."
