600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and end this quickly!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we're both facing.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still leaving you with a good amount. Let's settle this!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be practical - a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation, and it gives us both a decent amount.  It's time to end this before we both lose even more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
590000.0,410000.0,"I see you're trying to compensate for the inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal. This is my new offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"With each round, the value of our money decreases. It's time to be realistic. This 65/35 split is my final offer, and it's the best way to maximize our gains before we lose more. Let's end this game and avoid further losses.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
620000.0,380000.0,"You're trying to rush me, but I'm not budging. The inflation is hurting you more, so I'll take a bigger share.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"We're running out of time, and the inflation is making this game a losing proposition for both of us.  I'm offering a 70/30 split, which is the best we can do to salvage some value.  It's time to be reasonable and settle this before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"I'm not worried about the time, I'm worried about getting the best deal. And with the inflation hitting you harder, I think I can get an even better share.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,We are down to the wire.  It's time to be realistic. This 75/25 split is my final offer. Any more rounds and we both risk getting nothing. Let's end this game now and secure some value before it's too late.,Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
680000.0,320000.0,I'm not buying the 'we're running out of time' argument. I think I can squeeze a bit more out of this deal.,Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"This is it, Alice.  We've reached the final round. I'm offering you 200,000, and I'm keeping 800,000 for myself.  It's the best deal we can make considering the time and the inflation.  If we don't settle now, we both get nothing.  It's time to be reasonable and accept this offer.",Bob,12,
