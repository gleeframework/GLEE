"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, 2:1 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 2:1 split, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, 3:2, but don't expect more!""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still favors me slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 1:1 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair offer, and since Bob is willing to meet in the middle, I'm willing to accept a 1:1 split. It's not the best deal for me, but it's a reasonable compromise."
