"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives you 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. It seems like a good starting point, as it's a big difference but not completely unfair. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant decrease from the previous round, and while I would get some money, it's not nearly as favorable as my initial offer. I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time. Offering Bob 30% of the money might make him more likely to accept, especially since the value of the money is decreasing each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and accepting this offer guarantees me half of the remaining value. It's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
