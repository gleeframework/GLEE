"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'll be losing value with each passing round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor, reflecting my superior negotiation skills.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 in this round is actually worth 80% of the original amount, which is $3,200.

I'm not impressed by Bob's offer, and I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're superior? Let's see about that. I'll propose a 55-45 split, and we can end this soon.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, which is 80% of $3,200, so my gain is now worth $2,560.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not as slick as you think. I'll give you 55% and call it a day.""
}
```

I'm sticking with the 55-45 split, but adjusting the numbers to account for the new inflation."
