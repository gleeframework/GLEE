# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe I should aim for a better split to compensate for the loss in value.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although time is running out and Alice is offering a slightly better split, the impact of inflation is significant enough that I believe I should continue to negotiate for a more favorable deal to offset the loss in value.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal.\n\n###\n\nConsidering the urgency and the effect of inflation, my next proposal will aim to find a middle ground that acknowledges both the time pressure and the value loss due to inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Time's running out, and inflation's hitting me hard. This is as fair as I can get.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I've tried to balance the urgency of reaching an agreement with the impact of inflation on my share, hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."

Round 7

# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although Alice is offering a better split and emphasizing the need for an agreement, the cumulative effect of inflation is substantial. I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal to mitigate the loss in value due to inflation.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation, my next proposal will aim to slightly improve upon Alice's offer, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement before time runs out."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""We're running out of time. Given the inflation, I think this is the fairest split we can agree on.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given that Alice has framed this as her final offer and considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, accepting 60, which is worth 33.66% less than in the first round, is preferable to risking further loss or ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease conclude the game with this decision."
