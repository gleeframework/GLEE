Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I'm not going to accept this offer. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can get a better deal than that!""
}
