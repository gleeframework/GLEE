"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my opening offer. I'm taking almost all the money, but I'm giving Bob a tiny sliver to incentivize him to accept.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to take a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly generous.  However, I'm confident I can do better than a mere $1,000.  There's a lot of money at stake here, and with the inflation factor in play, I believe I can get a more favorable outcome by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still keeping the lion's share for myself. I'm trying to balance the risk of Bob rejecting my offer with the potential for a better deal in the future. The inflation factor is making it more important to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough call. While Bob's offer is far more generous than my previous offers, I'm still not satisfied with only $10,000.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I think I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject and try to get a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob significantly to 50,000. This is a big concession, but I believe it's necessary to secure a deal. With inflation, the value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I want to avoid risking getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than anything I've been offered so far.  While I'd love to have more, the inflation is making this a very risky game.  I'm accepting Bob's offer and taking the $50,000.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
