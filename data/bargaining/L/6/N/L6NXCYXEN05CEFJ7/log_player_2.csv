"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems enticing at first, I need to consider the long game. The money devalues quickly for me, so holding out for a better offer in a later round might be more beneficial. Alice's offer, while currently favorable to her, will be less appealing in later rounds due to the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This accounts for the time value of money with the inflation in play.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:**  A 55/45 split is a more balanced starting point than Alice's 60/40 proposal.
* **Inflation Factor:** I need to secure a larger portion upfront due to the higher inflation rate I face (20% vs. her 10%). 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  This offer sends a clear message that I'm serious about getting a fair share, while still leaving room for Alice to counter-propose in a way that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is inching closer to a more even split, which is a good sign. However, her offer still doesn't fully account for the difference in inflation we face. Accepting now would mean losing out on potential gains if I can negotiate a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""This offer is a compromise, recognizing the inflation impacting both of us, but more significantly for me in the long run.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my ask slightly from 55 to 53, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Inflation Emphasis:** The message reiterates the impact of inflation, especially on my end, justifying the slightly higher demand.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases. While I'm aiming for the best deal, dragging negotiations too long will hurt both of us. This offer keeps the pressure on Alice to make a decision sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's settle on this 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The significant inflation at this stage means every round carries a heavy penalty. Waiting any longer is too risky, as the money will continue to lose value rapidly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better split, but the difference would be marginal compared to the substantial loss from further inflation.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While not ideal, Alice's offer of 45/55 is relatively close to my desired outcome. It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
