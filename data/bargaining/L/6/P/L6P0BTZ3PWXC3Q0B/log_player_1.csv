I'm going to propose a 90/10 split.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving me the majority but still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation is a real concern.  Taking a 50/50 split is a good way to ensure I get something and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject offers."
