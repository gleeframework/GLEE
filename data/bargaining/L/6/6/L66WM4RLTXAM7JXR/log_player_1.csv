Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems a bit off, Alice. How about something closer to the middle? This offer is better for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
