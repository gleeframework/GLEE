"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. I'm keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share, but I'm willing to give you more than last time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $1,800.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
