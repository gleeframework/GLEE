"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can always try to negotiate in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount to start with, in the hopes that he'll be motivated to negotiate and we can reach a better deal in subsequent rounds."
