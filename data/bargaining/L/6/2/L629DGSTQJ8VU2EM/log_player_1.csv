"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is 50/50, I'm actually gaining less than I would have in the previous round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
