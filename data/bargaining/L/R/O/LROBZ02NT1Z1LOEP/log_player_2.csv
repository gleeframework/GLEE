"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Bob takes into account the inflation that affects both players but impacts him more significantly. By offering Alice $580,000, he aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties, considering the decreasing value of money with each round. The message emphasizes the reasonableness of the split given the inflationary pressures."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting both of us, Bob. Let's settle this before it gets any worse. This offer is my final one. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, which now render the money 19% less valuable for Bob compared to the first round and 9.75% less valuable for Alice, Alice's offer seems more reasonable. The fact that she frames it as her final offer also suggests that further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome for Bob, especially considering the increasing devaluation of the money with each subsequent round. Accepting this offer appears to be the most pragmatic decision under the current circumstances."
