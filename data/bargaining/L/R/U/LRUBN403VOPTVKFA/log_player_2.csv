This offer heavily favors Alice. I'm willing to negotiate, but not with such a large disparity."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split, Alice. This seems fair considering the inflation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is using the inflation to her advantage, but I'm not desperate yet. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be stubborn, Bob. The value for you diminishes with every round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation rapidly eroding my share, accepting a smaller amount is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
