"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and take the rest.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, Alice. 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000

I accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
