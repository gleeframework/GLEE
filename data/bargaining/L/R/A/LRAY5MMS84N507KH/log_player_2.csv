"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bigger share, Bob, but we need to find a compromise. Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair deal, and it avoids further risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware of the impact inflation has on her.  While her offer is better than the first round, she's trying to capitalize on my likely desire to avoid getting to the later rounds. It's a waiting game now, and I need to see if I can push her further while still being cautious of the time limit."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. The longer this drags on, the less appealing any deal becomes, especially for you.""
