"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair and reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, considering he's trying to take a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a slightly lower amount to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 45 is the most I can offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I deserve a bit more since the money is worth less now due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 42.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Since Bob's offer was 58/42, I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you more than 52. Let's meet in the middle.""
