"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round.  I figure if he rejects, I can make a slightly less aggressive offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to be equally aggressive, but I'm not going to accept that kind of deal!  The inflation is starting to hit, but I'm not desperate enough to accept such a low share so early in the game. I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a more balanced proposal, offering Bob a larger share but still ensuring I get a decent amount. It's a risky move, as we're still early in the game, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still pushing for a larger share, but I'm not giving in.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident I can secure a better deal for myself.  I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which feels like a fair compromise given the current state of the game. The inflation is starting to affect our earnings significantly, so it's time to be more practical and reach a middle ground.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
