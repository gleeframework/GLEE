Let's see if we can get a better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to give me a bit more, as I'm taking on the risk of you rejecting my offer. Let's see if we can work this out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 2:1 is too extreme. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than what I could potentially get in the next round, considering the inflation. It's a fair compromise."
