"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 600,000 and leaving 400,000 for Bob. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good deal last time, but I think I can do better this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 60% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 70-30 split in Bob's favor. I'll have to think carefully about it.

For now, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my gain is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, due to the cumulative 40% inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Time for a fair split, 40-60 is a good compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on me! My gain of 200,000 is now worth only 32% of what it was in the first round.

Bob's offer is a 80-20 split, which is quite lopsided in his favor. I'm not sure if I should accept it, but I'm running out of options.

For now, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money I gain is now worth only 25.6% of what it was in the first round, due to the cumulative 60.8% inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal, don't be greedy""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a relatively even distribution of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
