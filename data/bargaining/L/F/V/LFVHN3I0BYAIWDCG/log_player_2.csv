"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting,  it's better to see if we can get a more favorable deal.  We have 12 rounds to work with, and the money is worth more to me than it is to Alice in later rounds due to inflation.  I'll try to negotiate a better split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money will be worth less for both of us in later rounds.  Let's make this deal and end the game."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This one is more realistic. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While she is taking into account inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal by holding out.  I'll try to negotiate a lower amount for her in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share. This takes into account both our losses due to inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable split for myself. I'm willing to continue playing, as the inflation affects me more severely than Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. It's the fairest option considering the current inflation rates.  We can end this game now and avoid further losses.""
