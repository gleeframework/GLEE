"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 10%, but next round I'm taking a bigger share! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is deliberately unfair, banking on my fear of inflation.  While 10% is better than nothing, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40.  We're both losing money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to take the lion's share. Accepting 40% now is better than nothing, but I believe I can get a better deal.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This is a fair split considering the circumstances.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  We're both losing money.  A 50/50 split is the only sensible way to go from here. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally willing to agree to a fair split. While I might have been able to negotiate a slightly better deal in earlier rounds, the inflation is working against me. Accepting a 50/50 split now is the safest option to ensure we both get something."
