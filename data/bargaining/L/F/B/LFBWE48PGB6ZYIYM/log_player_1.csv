"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $6000 and Bob receiving $4000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is closer to 55/45,  let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less in this round due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. A 55/45 split is still not ideal for me, and I'm willing to take the risk to see if I can get a more favorable offer in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 58-42 split, with me receiving $5800 and Bob receiving $4200. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see how he responds! Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're both losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'm accepting Bob's offer. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept the 50/50 split. At this point, both of us are losing a substantial amount of money with each passing round, and it's better to secure $5000 now rather than risking further losses. This seems like a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm willing to conclude the game with this agreement."
