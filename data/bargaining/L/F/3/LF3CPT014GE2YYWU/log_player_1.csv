"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I still want a decent share 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I think I'll accept it. The 70% gain for me is a decent share, and I'm not sure I can do better in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
