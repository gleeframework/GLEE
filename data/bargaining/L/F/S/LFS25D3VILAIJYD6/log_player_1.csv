"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll get 70% of 80% of the original $100, which is 56. I'm not sure if I'll be better off accepting this offer, but I'll have to consider it.

After calculating, I think I'll accept this offer.
