"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a very small share. I figure he'll be tempted to accept rather than risk getting nothing at all if we keep going.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more fair than my own, but it's still not enough.  I know I have a good chance of getting a better deal if I can make it to round 3. I'm willing to risk it!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to get a better deal than Bob's offer.  I think I can offer him a more respectable sum while still getting a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal than my previous offers and the inflation is starting to hurt Bob's gains.  I don't want to risk getting nothing at all!"
