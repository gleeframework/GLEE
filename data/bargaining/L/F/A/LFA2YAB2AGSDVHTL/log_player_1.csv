Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think a 51/49 split is only fair if we both have the same rate of inflation.  Since yours is higher, I'll offer you a 49/51 split instead. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
