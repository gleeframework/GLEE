Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, but I think a 51/49 split is only fair if we both have the same rate of inflation.  Since yours is higher, I'll offer you a 49/51 split instead.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  Inflation is impacting us, but we can still find a way to split the money fairly.  I propose a 50/50 split, which seems the most equitable given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
