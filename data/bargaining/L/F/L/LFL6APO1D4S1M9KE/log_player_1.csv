"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a slightly higher amount for myself to compensate for the loss of value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and Bob's message, I think he's being reasonable. I'll accept this offer.
