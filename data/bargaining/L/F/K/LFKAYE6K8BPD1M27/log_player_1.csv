"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and keep 60.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 50 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 40. So, in real terms, I'm still getting 40.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good deal, so I'll accept it.
