"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 75/25 split in my favor.  Since you rejected my previous offer, I'm confident in my position this round.  Remember, the value of your money decreases by 10% each round, so you're better off accepting this deal. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{
