"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, especially considering the inflation that has occurred. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still maintain a significant share. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that further rejection will lead to even more inflation, making his share even smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, the inflation has made a considerable impact on the value of the money. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure at least some gain.  Further rounds risk losing even more due to inflation."
