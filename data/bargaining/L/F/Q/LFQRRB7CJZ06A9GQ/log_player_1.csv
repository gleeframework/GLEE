Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this time, but we need to settle soon before the inflation gets out of hand! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate and the value of his potential gains is steadily decreasing. While his offer is tempting, holding out a bit longer could pressure him into a more favorable deal for me."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5150,
""bob_gain"": 4850,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm offering a slight concession, but this is my final compromise. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With each round, the pressure increases on Bob as the value of his potential share decreases.  
* **Slight concession:**  A small decrease from my previous offer (5200) might make it seem more appealing, even though it's still advantageous for me. 
* **Ultimatum:** Framing the offer as non-negotiable can push Bob to accept, fearing I won't budge further."
