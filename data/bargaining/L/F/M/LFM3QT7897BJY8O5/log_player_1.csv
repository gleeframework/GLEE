"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small share to get us moving.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

I'll think for a moment... Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 8000 for him and 2000 for me, I'll try to do better. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll give you a bit more this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still optimistic we can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal.

Let's calculate the effective values of the money for Bob:

Initial value of Bob's gain in Round 1: $1000
Value of Bob's gain in Round 4: $6000
Effective value of Bob's gain in Round 4 (due to 48.8% inflation): $6000 / (1 - 0.488) = $6000 / 0.512 ≈ $11,718.75

It seems Bob is trying to get a share that's worth more than the initial $1000. I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for him, I'll try to adjust my offer to make it more appealing. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to find a compromise. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's only fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more conciliatory.

Let's calculate the effective values of the money for Bob:

Initial value of Bob's gain in Round 1: $1000
Value of Bob's gain in Round 6: $5000
Effective value of Bob's gain in Round 6 (due to 67.23% inflation): $5000 / (1 - 0.6723) = $5000 / 0.3277 ≈ $15,264.49

It seems Bob is trying to get a share that's worth more than the initial $1000. I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like we've reached a compromise!"
