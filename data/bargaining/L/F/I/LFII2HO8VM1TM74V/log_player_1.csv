{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40, a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer, while still keeping some for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
