"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of rejection, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to negotiate a bit more for himself. Given the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $800,000.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60% share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, which is $405,000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the inflation.""
