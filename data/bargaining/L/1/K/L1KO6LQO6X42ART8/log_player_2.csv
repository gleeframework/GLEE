Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as her potential gains from the $100 are rapidly decreasing. While her offers are getting marginally better, they are nowhere near a fair split considering the rate of inflation working against her. By continuing to reject her offers, I increase the chances of her eventually offering a deal where I receive the majority of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and your potential gains are shrinking fast. Take this offer before it's too late!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand now that Alice is feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.  This offer is still heavily in my favor, and the message is designed to make Alice realize she needs to make a deal soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know time is running out, but I still want a bit more than you're offering 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the time pressure, her offer is only marginally better than before. The inflation is significantly eroding her potential gains, making my position stronger with each passing round. I'll continue to apply pressure by rejecting this offer and hope she comes back with something much closer to a 60/40 split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This is my final offer.  Take it before inflation makes it completely worthless for you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing my advantage slightly while making it clear this is my final offer. This approach creates a sense of urgency and finality. Alice is running out of time, and even though this offer heavily favors me, it's still significantly better than nothing, which is what she'll get if she continues to reject my proposals."
