I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept something small.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than in the first round due to inflation, it's still better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other. I'll accept Bob's offer and get $1,000."
