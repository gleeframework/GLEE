"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. 

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll get 600000 * 0.95 = 570000.
For Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so he'll get 400000 * 0.8 = 320000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
