This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting is the best option now:

* **Severe Inflation:**  Bob is losing value incredibly fast.  Taking 430,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  She's barely budging in her offers. Waiting for a significantly better deal is unlikely.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a perfect 50/50 split might mean ending up with nothing if the game goes on too long."
