"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I take a bit more to start, and we can avoid inflation eating our money! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the potential of getting a better deal later.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a fair split considering the potential for inflation. Let's avoid further losses and reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My last offer was already generous, and the clock is ticking. I'm firm on this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Alice's proposal is still favorable, and the inflation is eating into our potential gains. It's time to secure something rather than risk losing it all."
