Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60, I'll try to get a better deal for myself this time.
