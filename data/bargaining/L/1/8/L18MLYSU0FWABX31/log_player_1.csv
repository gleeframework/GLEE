"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30% share, I want a bit more. The offer is still too skewed towards Bob's favor. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it 45-55""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I'm willing to compromise to get a better deal."
