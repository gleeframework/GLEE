"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is more attractive than it initially seems.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
