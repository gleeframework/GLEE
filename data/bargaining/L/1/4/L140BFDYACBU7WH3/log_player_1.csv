I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive start, but I figure I have the advantage of being the first proposer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty good, even with the 20% inflation. I'd rather have 6000 than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's take it!"
