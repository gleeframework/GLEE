"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no haggling 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, I calculate that my gain of 50 is worth 80% of the original 50 (due to 20% inflation), so it's actually equivalent to 40 of the original amount.

As for Bob's gain, since it's 50, and the money is worth 5% less, it's equivalent to 47.5 of the original amount.

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a smaller share to Bob this time, but still a fair one.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Let's calculate the equivalent values:

My gain of 40 is worth 51.2% of the original 80 (due to 48.8% inflation), so it's actually equivalent to 40.96 of the original amount.

Bob's gain of 60 is worth 95.74% of the original 50 (due to 14.26% inflation), so it's actually equivalent to 47.87 of the original amount.

Considering these values, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best deal, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gains.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I need a bigger share""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Let's calculate the equivalent values:

My gain of 45 is worth 56.25% of the original 80 (due to 67.23% inflation), so it's actually equivalent to 45 of the original amount.

Bob's gain of 55 is worth 110% of the original 50 (due to 22.62% inflation), so it's actually equivalent to 55 of the original amount.

Considering these values, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a decent deal, considering the inflation. I'll take it!"
