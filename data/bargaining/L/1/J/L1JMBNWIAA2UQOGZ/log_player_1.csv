"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a very simple offer, but it maximizes my take in this first round. I'm not sure how Bob will react, but we'll see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than the offer I made in the previous round.  Even with inflation, his offer is significantly lower for me than my offer was for him. I'll reject and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to try to push for a slightly better deal than the previous round. Bob's offer was quite bad, and I think he'll realize that he needs to offer me more if he wants to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of his offer. His offer is still much lower than the offer I made in round 3, and I believe I can do better than this. I'll reject and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I think it's a reasonable amount considering the inflation.  Bob is going to have to make a better deal if he wants to get any of the money."
