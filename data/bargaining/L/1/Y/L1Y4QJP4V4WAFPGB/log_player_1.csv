"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite reasonable, considering the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in the second round, his offer is effectively 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000 in real terms. That's a good split.

I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
