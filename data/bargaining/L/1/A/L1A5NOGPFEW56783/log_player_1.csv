Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Accepting $500,000 now is better than risking an even lower amount in future rounds.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixed on the 50/50 split. It's unlikely he'll budge from this position.
* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome becomes for me due to inflation. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting the current offer prevents further losses due to the decreasing value of the money."
