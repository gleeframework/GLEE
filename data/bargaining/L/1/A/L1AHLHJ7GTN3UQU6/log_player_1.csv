"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the money, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but let's see if we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain would be 80% of 80% of $100, which is 64.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get 50% of $100, which is $50. Since I'm already getting less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer to get a higher amount.
