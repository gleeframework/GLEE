Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both need to compromise to get something. I'm willing to give up some of my share to avoid another round of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Importantly, the inflation is hitting her harder than me. It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a more equitable split."
