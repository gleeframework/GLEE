"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm taking the lion's share in this first round, but I'm leaving a small amount for Bob to see if he's willing to play along. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to accept rather than risk losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing some money due to inflation, I'm still getting a decent amount. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing more in the next round, where my share could decrease further."
