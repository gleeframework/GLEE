I'm going for a large share in the first round, aiming to secure a decent amount before inflation kicks in. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!  While I lose only 5% due to inflation, he's losing a significant 20%. I'm not going to let him get away with that. It's my turn to propose again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a substantial share.  Bob's offer was clearly a bluff, and I need to assert my position.  Let's see if he takes this offer or continues to gamble with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculous! Inflation is hitting him hard, but I'm still in a better position. I'm not going to settle for a 20% share after being the one to propose better offers.  Let's see if he can come up with something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a majority share. Bob is losing a significant amount to inflation, and it's clear he's desperate to reach a deal. I need to find a balance between securing a decent amount and not pushing him to the point of complete rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation. He's offering me a pitiful 30% while he's losing a huge chunk due to inflation.  I'm not giving in. I'm still in a better position than him, even with the inflation affecting me.  Let's see if he can come up with something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm still aiming for a decent share, but I'm realizing I need to be more flexible. Bob is clearly desperate now, and it's possible he'll accept even a less favorable offer than my previous ones. I'm lowering my proposed share again, hoping to find a point where we can agree before we both lose even more money."
