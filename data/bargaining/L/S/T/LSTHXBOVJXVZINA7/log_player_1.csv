"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, my gain of 6000 in the first round is now equivalent to 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67 in the second round.

In comparison, Bob's offer of 4000 in the second round is equivalent to 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as good as my initial offer, considering the inflation effect. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my previous offer of 6000 in the first round is now worth 6000 / (0.9 * 0.9) = 6666.67 in the third round.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
