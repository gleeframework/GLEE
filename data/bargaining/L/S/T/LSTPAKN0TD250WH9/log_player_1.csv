"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40, no need to negotiate""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more fair.  I think 55/45 is a good starting point.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of money, I'd like to try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55/45 is fair, especially with the inflation. I'll think about it and come back with a counteroffer""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, no more negotiations""
}"
