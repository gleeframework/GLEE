"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll consider this offer carefully. Since Bob is offering an equal split, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
