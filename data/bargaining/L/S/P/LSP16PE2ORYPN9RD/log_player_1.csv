"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""A fair and balanced split, let's wrap it up!""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair and balanced split, and I'd like to wrap up the game with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""I'm not accepting this unfair split. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}

I'll think about what I want to propose next..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share it equally!""
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $5,000 each. I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
