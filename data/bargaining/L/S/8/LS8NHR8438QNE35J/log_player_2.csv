"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflationary effect, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
