Round 5

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to wear me down with incremental changes, but I'm holding firm. Accepting now sets a bad precedent and shows I'm willing to cave under pressure.  We still have time to negotiate."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still playing games and trying to inch her way to a more favorable outcome.  While her offer has increased, it's not a significant jump.  I need to show I'm serious about my position and not going to be swayed by small concessions this late in the game."
