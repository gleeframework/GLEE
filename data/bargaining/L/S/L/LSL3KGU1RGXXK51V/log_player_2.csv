Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take what you can get 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most rational decision. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer Bob waits, the less his share is worth due to inflation.  
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage, offering increasingly worse deals.
* **Potential for Losing Everything:** If Bob rejects this offer and tries to negotiate in Round 8, there's a chance he'll be left with an even worse offer, potentially getting almost nothing.

While $3,500 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten in earlier rounds, it's better than risking a worse outcome by continuing to play."
