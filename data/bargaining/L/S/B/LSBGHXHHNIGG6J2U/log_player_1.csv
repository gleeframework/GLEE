"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a fair split, 600k for me and 400k for you. It's a better deal for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd prefer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to get me to accept the same offer I made in the first round, but with the advantage of knowing I'll accept a lower amount due to the inflation. I'm not falling for it. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was just a repeat of the first round, I'm going to try to make a slightly more aggressive offer this time. I'll take a bit more, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all the leverage. Meet me in the middle and we can finalize the deal.""
}
