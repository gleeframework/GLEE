Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and your pile is shrinking. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Don't let greed make you lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time pressure is mounting, Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation disadvantage. Accepting $400,000 now is better than nothing, but I believe holding out for a better offer in the next couple of rounds is worth the risk.  Alice knows I'm becoming increasingly desperate, but she also doesn't want to walk away with nothing."
