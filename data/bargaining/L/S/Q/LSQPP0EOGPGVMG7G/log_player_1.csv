Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about getting a smaller share, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
