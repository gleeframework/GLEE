Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice.  We both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
