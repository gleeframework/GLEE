"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'll need the majority of the money. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm willing to split the money 55/45, but I'm not going to give you a larger share. This will ensure we both get a decent amount and avoid further losses due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to offset the inflation hitting me harder.  This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we risk losing more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, given the inflation hitting Alice harder and the risk of further losses, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I receive something at all."
