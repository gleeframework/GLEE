Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to split the money 55/45, but I'm not going to give you a larger share. This will ensure we both get a decent amount and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
