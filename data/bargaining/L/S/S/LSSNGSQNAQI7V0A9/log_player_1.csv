I'm going for a slightly unfair split, hoping to get the most I can in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm not going to accept that! It's only fair that we try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split, aiming for a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's see if Bob will accept this!"
