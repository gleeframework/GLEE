"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we're still close to a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less now, I'd rather not take a smaller share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we're still close to a fair split. Let's get this done!""
}
```

Note that I'm mirroring Bob's message from Round 2, and making a similar offer, but with the money worth 10% less due to inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
