I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me getting the larger share. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy, but I'm starting with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a much worse deal for me than the initial offer.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 6000, which is a significant reduction, but it still gives me a majority.  This is a compromise to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to avoid giving up too much."
