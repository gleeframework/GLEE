"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, given that the money will be worth less in the next round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that the 55-45 split is the best deal for me. I think I can do better.

I'm proposing that I get 58% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 42%."
