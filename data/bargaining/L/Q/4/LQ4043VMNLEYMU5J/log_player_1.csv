"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I think this is a fair offer, as I am taking on the risk of the money losing value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer. While the money is worth less than in the first round, I'm guaranteed to get something, whereas if I reject and propose my own offer, I risk getting nothing."
