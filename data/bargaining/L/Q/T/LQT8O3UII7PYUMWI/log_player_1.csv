"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting, but ultimately unfair given the inflation. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in your favor. It gives you a slight edge while acknowledging the money's decreasing value for me over time. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
