"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, my share of the money is worth even less now. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation still eating away at the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
