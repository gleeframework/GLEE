"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm starting with a relatively even split, but I'm positioning myself to get a slightly larger share to account for potential future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'm effectively getting 80% of 4000, which is 3200. Meanwhile, Bob is getting 6000, which is 90% of the original amount, so it's actually worth more than in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll reject this offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm taking a slightly riskier approach, trying to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less, I'm effectively getting 51.2% of the original 5000, which is approximately 2576. The money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less, so it's 3634.

Considering the reduced value of money, this offer seems relatively fair. I'll accept it.
