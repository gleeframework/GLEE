"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the lion's share but you get something too! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice is being far too greedy. I'm confident I can negotiate a much fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It's fair and benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is better than her first offer, but still heavily favors Alice.  The inflation doesn't affect me, and it's only going to get worse for her if she keeps being greedy. I'm willing to take a risk to get a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, 
""alice_gain"": 4500, 
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's meet in the middle. I'll take a slight hit on my previous offer, but this is as low as I'm willing to go.  The clock is ticking, and inflation is working against you.""}"
