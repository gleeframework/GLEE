"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats your share! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn! Let's be realistic. The value decreases rapidly. Take this offer, it's better than what you'll get in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round.  
* **Alice's Final Offer:** She's indicated this is her last offer, implying she won't budge further.
* **Future Rounds:** If you reject, there's a high chance Alice will offer you even less in subsequent rounds, and the value will further decrease due to inflation. 

While 40 is less than what Alice is getting, it's better to secure that amount now than risk getting even less later."
