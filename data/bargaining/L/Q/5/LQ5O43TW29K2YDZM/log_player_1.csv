"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make a better offer this time. Let's see if you can do better than me! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to match my initial offer!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I can take advantage of this. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! I'll take advantage of that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think I can still do better, considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more significantly."

  ""bob_gain"": 3700,

# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a big bite out of Bob's gain! I'll take a closer look at Bob's new offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the extreme inflation affecting his gain, I think this is a reasonable deal. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
