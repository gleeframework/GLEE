"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... I'd rather not give up $8,000 to Bob just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... I'd rather not give up $7,000 to Bob just yet. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint and the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
