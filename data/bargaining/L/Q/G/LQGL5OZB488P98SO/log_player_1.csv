"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a generous 10% to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% to 10% split, giving Bob a relatively small share to get him on board."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
* Bob's gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share, considering the inflation affects me more. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount is 400000 * 0.8 = 320000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32% to 68% split, trying to give Bob a slightly larger share while still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to be fair 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 300000 * 0.5192 = 155520
* Bob's gain: 700000 * 0.8554 = 599580

I'm not sure if I want to give up such a significant share, considering the inflation affects me more. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount is 155520 * 0.8 = 124416.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 124416,
  ""bob_gain"": 875584,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a huge share, but I need to make sure I get something!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 12.4% to 87.6% split, trying to give Bob a very large share in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game."
