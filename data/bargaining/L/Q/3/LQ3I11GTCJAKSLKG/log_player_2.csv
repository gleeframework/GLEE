"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm also a smart businesswoman. This deal is fair, and it gets this game over quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is ridiculously unfair, and even though I'm playing as Bob, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, considering the money will be worth less each round. Let's finish this!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also aware of the inflation affecting your share. This offer is fair, considering the circumstances. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is hurting my share significantly. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me something, even though it's less than ideal."
