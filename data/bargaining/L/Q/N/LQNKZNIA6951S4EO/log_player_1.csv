"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will receive $80 and Bob will receive $20. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. It's a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

The offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. However, considering the original value, I would be getting $50, but it's worth 95% of the original $80 I proposed in the first round, so it's a bit less than I initially suggested.

I'll accept the offer, but I'll keep in mind that I could have gotten more if I had held out for a better deal.
