Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split in my favor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer, but still keep most of the money for myself.  I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with inflation hitting me harder, I think it's wise to take this offer and secure some money."
