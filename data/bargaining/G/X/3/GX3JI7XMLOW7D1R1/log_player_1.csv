"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting and getting even less in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
