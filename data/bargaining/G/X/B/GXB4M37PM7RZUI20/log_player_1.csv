  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 300k, is that okay?""
}

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a generous 30% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 500k, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 475,000.

I don't think this is a fair start, considering I could have gotten 700,000 in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
