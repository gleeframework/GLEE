"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference!  I think this is a fair and reasonable start.  We both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can avoid the inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
