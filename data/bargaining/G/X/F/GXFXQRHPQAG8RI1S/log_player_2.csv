"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly biased, division. I'll take the larger share, but you'll get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth rejecting this offer. While 1000 is something, the inflation rate for Alice is significantly higher. It's likely we can get a better deal if we push for more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference!  I think this is a fair and reasonable start.  We both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can avoid the inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}
