"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($90), while still giving Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept. I want to see if he's willing to accept a less-than-fair deal in the first round, or if he'll try to negotiate for a better share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, giving me only $5. While the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, it's still a significant difference. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since I have the opportunity to propose a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $60 for myself, while still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money ($40). This is a more balanced offer than my previous proposal, acknowledging that Bob is willing to negotiate. I hope this offer will be more appealing to him, considering the inflation that's occurred."
