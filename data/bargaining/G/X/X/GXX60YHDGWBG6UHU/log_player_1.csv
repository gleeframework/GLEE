"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the inflation factor. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather not accept a split that's even more skewed towards Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 55/45 split, especially with inflation affecting my end. Can you consider a more even split?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a 50/50 split, considering the inflation factor. What do you think, Bob?""
}
