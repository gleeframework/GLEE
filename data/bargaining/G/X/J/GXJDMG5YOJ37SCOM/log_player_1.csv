Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55:45 split is a fairer starting point, considering the risk of inflation. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.
