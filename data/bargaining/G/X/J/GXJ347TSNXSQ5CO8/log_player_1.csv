"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and leave 20% for Bob. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but Bob will still get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth 56 (70 * 0.8) and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 28.8 (30 * 0.96).

I'll accept this offer.
