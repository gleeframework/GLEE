Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being a little greedy, but I'm hoping Bob will be rational and accept this offer to get at least something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's a fair offer. I'd rather get $500,000 than risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other."
