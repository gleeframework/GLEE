"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose 90 for me, 10 for you. We can always adjust later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the money will lose value with each round. Let's be reasonable and get this done.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to 70/30, but I don't want to go any lower.  We need to work together or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  Let's take the 30% and avoid losing it all."
