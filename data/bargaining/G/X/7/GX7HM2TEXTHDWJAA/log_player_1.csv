Please relay this to Bob and let me know his response."

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than Alice's offer. This split is a little closer to 50/50, and still gives you a good chunk of the money. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
