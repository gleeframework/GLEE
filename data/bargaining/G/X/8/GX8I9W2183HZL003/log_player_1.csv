"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The inflation is working against me, Bob.  This is a counter-offer.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need more than 450,000 to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While he's offering a slightly larger share than his previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I proposed in Round 1, and inflation is eating into my potential gains. It's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is running out, and this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to come to an agreement soon. Inflation is hitting you harder, but I'm also losing out.  This offer is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a difficult decision, and time pressure is mounting. However, Bob's offer is still significantly skewed in his favor, even accounting for the inflation hitting my potential gains. His ""final compromise"" language is also a tactic to pressure me. I'm willing to gamble on one more counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising. This is a reasonable offer considering we both lose if this fails. Don't be greedy.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Time is running critically short.  While Bob's offer was too low, I need to make a significant move towards his position to avoid losing everything. This offer is a last-ditch attempt to secure a deal while still getting a reasonable share, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and desire to avoid a lose-lose situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are down to the wire.  This is my final offer.  If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a devastatingly low offer, but I have no choice.  Bob has me over a barrel. If I reject this, we both get nothing, and at this point, taking the pittance Bob is offering is better than nothing."
