Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, hoping inflation will force me to accept a worse deal. While 43 is rapidly becoming a less appealing number, I still hold the power to propose in the next round.  I need to convey urgency and the significant loss we both face if we don't settle soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing out with every wasted round.  This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and end this.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is working heavily against me. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of my share is plummeting. While 44 is significantly less than I wanted, rejecting this offer means risking an even lower amount in future rounds. 
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly using a waiting game, banking on my desperation as inflation eats into my gains. She's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point. If I reject this, there's a real chance we'll reach round 12 with no agreement, leaving us both with nothing.

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now secures me something, which is looking increasingly better than nothing as the clock ticks down."
