"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, and Bob will get 10%. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm starting with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going for a lowball offer. Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to gain $225,000 (90% of $250,000) in this round, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a reasonable compromise. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
