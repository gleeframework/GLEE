Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground.  I'll go down to 60%, you go up to 40%. We can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's important to remember that the longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us, but especially for Alice. I need to push for a more favorable split while it still holds significant value."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""It's clear we need a more balanced deal. How about 55% for me and 45% for you?  Time is running out and the money is losing value."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting a larger share. The message emphasizes the time pressure and the devaluation of the money, which should incentivize Alice to accept a more equitable deal."
