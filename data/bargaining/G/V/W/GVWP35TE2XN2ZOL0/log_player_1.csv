# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not sure if I want to accept an even split. My gain of 5000$ is worth 5% less than in the first round, but Bob's gain of 5000$ is worth 20% less than in the first round. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer, considering the increased inflation. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

# Alice gain: 4500

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's still relatively close to the original 50-50 split, considering the decreased value of money. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on both of us. Considering the extreme decrease in the value of money, I'm starting to think that I might have to accept a lower offer. However, Bob's gain is still worth a significant amount less than the original 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 9

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500
}

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm running out of options and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Considering the extremely low value of money at this point, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or not.

However, with Bob's gain being worth so much less than the original 50-50 split, I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into the next round with an even lower value of money.
