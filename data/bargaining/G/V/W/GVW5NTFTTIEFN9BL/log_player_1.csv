Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 30%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob's gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of the original $10,000 as well.

I'll reject this offer. The difference between our gains is still too large.
