Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy strategy, hoping Bob will accept this first offer to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy for me. Bob's offer gives me a significant amount of money, and if I reject it, there is a chance I could end up with nothing in future rounds."
