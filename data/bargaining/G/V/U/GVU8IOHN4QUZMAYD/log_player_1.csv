"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave Bob with 40 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 70-30? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious with my offers.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 70-30 is a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 70-30. Can you meet me in the middle at 55-45?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a more balanced compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50-50. It's only fair!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight edge. How about 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of Bob's offer is decreasing rapidly. I'm not sure if I want to give him the edge he's asking for.

Considering the current state of the economy, I think I can do better than 45 dollars. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 55-45. Can you meet me at 52-48?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. 55-45 is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to stick to my previous message and offer a 55-45 split, but this time it's my final offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle the deal."
