"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. This way we both benefit from splitting the money now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a more even split, Bob, but remember the money loses value quickly for both of us. I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for me this time, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice acknowledges the need for a more balanced split, her offer still heavily favors her. The slightly higher amount doesn't compensate for the rapid devaluation of the money, especially for Bob.  It's worth risking another round to aim for a fairer division."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon.  I'm proposing a split that's closer to the middle ground, acknowledging the inflation but also ensuring a fairer outcome for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. Let's go back to my initial offer. It might seem like I'm not budging, but with the inflation, it's the best way to ensure we both get a reasonable amount in the end. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The relentless inflation is making this a difficult decision. However, waiting any longer significantly risks getting nothing at all. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure something now rather than risk getting a worse offer later or, even worse, reaching the 12th round with no deal."
