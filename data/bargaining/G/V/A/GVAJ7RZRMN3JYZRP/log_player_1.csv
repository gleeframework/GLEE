"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a little more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good deal for me, I want a fairer split""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I should get a larger share, considering the money is worth less for me due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less than the previous round), I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me now, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still not a good deal for me, I want a more significant share""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the gap between our shares is too large, and I think I should get a larger share, considering the money is worth less for me due to inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.39% less for me now (5% less than the previous round, and an additional 14.26% from the previous round), I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
