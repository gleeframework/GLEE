"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can take the smaller share this round, I'll take the bigger one. It's my turn to lead! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the lead!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation effect. Since my share is worth 5% less this round, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to give up so much yet. Let's try something else.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 50/50. Let's try this!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and keeping the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet. Keep trying! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to drive the negotiations in his favor!

Considering the inflation effect, my share is worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, which is a significant drop. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much more. Let's try something else.""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50/50 split. It's a fair and equal proposal.""
}
```

I'm trying to revert to a more neutral proposal, hoping to bring the negotiations back to a more balanced point."
