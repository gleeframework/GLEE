"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm open to adjusting it in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem entirely fair to me, and I believe we can negotiate a better split, considering the impact of inflation on our earnings. Let's continue to the next round where I'll propose an alternative division."
