"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving Bob a bit more than half, hoping he'll accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation will hit us both in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation hitting us both, I'd rather take the smaller share now and avoid further erosion of value. I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
