"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is a good starting point.  It's a fair split, but gives me a slight advantage.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even accounting for inflation. I'll reject and see if he'll give me a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5900, ""bob_gain"": 4100}
```

I'll offer a slightly better deal for Bob than his offer in the previous round.  Hopefully, this will entice him to accept, and I can secure a deal close to my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5650 
# Bob gain: 4350 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not as good as my initial offer, but inflation has taken a significant toll. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I still get a decent share of the money."
