60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  I think this is a fair offer since I'm losing more to inflation with each round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable, you're losing more to inflation than I am. How about a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"I understand your point, but I'm the one taking on more risk with the inflation.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you.",Bob,4,
