"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 80% of $6,000 (20% less than $8,000), and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 95% of $5,800 (5% less than $6,100).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
