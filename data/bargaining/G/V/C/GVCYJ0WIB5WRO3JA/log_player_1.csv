"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm keeping the remaining 70% for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think about it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'd be getting $190,000 (200,000 x 0.95). That's a decent offer, but I was hoping for a bit more.

However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. So, I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
