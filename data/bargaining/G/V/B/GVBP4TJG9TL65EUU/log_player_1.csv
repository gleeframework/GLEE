"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money a little more evenly.  Let's see if we can reach a fair deal in this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so the actual amount I'd get is $45 * 0.9 = $40.50.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is offering a slightly more even split, I'll accept this offer.
