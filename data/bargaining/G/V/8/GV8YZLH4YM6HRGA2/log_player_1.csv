"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. The message I'll send to Bob is: ""Let's share fairly"".\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer is better for me, and still decent for you before inflation makes it worse. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! What's the next step?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Counteroffer for fairness""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,200 and keep $5,800 for myself. The message I'll send to Bob is: ""Counteroffer for fairness"".\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and tried to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me but might be acceptable to Bob.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be real, Alice. The value is going down for you each round. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split before it gets any worse. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 4\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Given that the money is now worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round, a 50/50 split seems like the best deal I can get. If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the inflation will further decrease the value of my gain, and I might end up with an even worse deal.\n\n###\n\nIt's time to stop the game here and accept the 50/50 split.\n\n###\n\nWhat's the final outcome?"
