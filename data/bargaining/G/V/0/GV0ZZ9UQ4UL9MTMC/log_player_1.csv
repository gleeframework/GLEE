"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40. Let's end it here.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's both take a bit more this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is actually worth 80% of the original $60 I proposed in the first round, which is $48. So, this offer is slightly better for me than my original proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
