"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, let's just divide and get out of here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority, huh? That's a bit cheeky!
