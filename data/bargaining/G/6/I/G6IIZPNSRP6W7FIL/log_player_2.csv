"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to take the 50/50 split, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. Inflation is in play, and I'm not sure how it affects Alice, so I'm going to see if I can leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think I can offer you a better deal than 50/50. With the potential for inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share now for a chance to secure more in the future.  What do you think?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd still like a bigger share, the inflation has made it less desirable to keep rejecting offers. Alice seems willing to negotiate, and this offer is still a good deal for me considering the inflation."
