I'm going to offer Bob a small share to try and get the game going quickly. I figure he might accept it in the first round, and if he doesn't, I can adjust my offer later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and it's in my best interest to accept it. While I may gain a little more by rejecting and making a counter-offer, the risk of inflation means I could end up with less."
