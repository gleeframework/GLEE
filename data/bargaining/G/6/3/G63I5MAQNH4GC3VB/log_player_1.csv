"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and I'm not leaving too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money, even with the inflation adjustment. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 45, you take 55. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and not giving Bob too much."
