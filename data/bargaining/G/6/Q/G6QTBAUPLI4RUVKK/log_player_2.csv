"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point, but we can adjust in the next rounds if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While I only get a tiny share, the inflation will eat away at the value for both of us if this drags on. I need to aim for a much fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer accounts for the time pressure and gives us both a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable split, but the deal still heavily favors her considering the rapid depreciation of her potential winnings. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. This offer is a fair compromise to reach an agreement.""}
