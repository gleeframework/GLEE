"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the first to make an offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting! My potential gain is worth 20% less now.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, especially since the inflation has already reduced the value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, but still trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. My potential gain is now worth 48.8% less than it was initially.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is the best I can get, especially considering the significant inflation. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, but I'm still aiming to maximize my gain considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll. My potential gain is now worth 67.23% less than it was initially.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been offered a decent deal, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. It's better to take what I can get at this point, rather than risking further negotiations and potentially getting an even worse deal."
