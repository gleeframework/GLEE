"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, emphasizing the fairness of the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's be reasonable - this is a little better for me than your offer last round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth less to me now, I think I can still get a better deal. Since Bob's offer is only slightly better for him than my previous offer, I believe there's room for further negotiation. Let's proceed to the next round and see if I can make a more favorable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer $57 for myself and $43 for Bob. Since the money is worth less to me now, I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway between our previous offers. The message highlights the impact of inflation and encourages Bob to accept this more balanced proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the inflation we both face. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth significantly less to me now, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation we both face. Since Bob's offer is still skewed in his favor, I believe it's worth proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal. The fact that Bob is emphasizing the fairness of the offer suggests that he may be willing to compromise further. Let's see if I can make a more appealing proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me harder, let's rebalance""}\n\nI'll offer $52 for myself and $48 for Bob. Given that inflation is affecting me more significantly, I believe it's essential to rebalance the proposal in my favor. By doing so, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this offer. The message highlights the unequal impact of inflation and justifies the adjusted proposal."
