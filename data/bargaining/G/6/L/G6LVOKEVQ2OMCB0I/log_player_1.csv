"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can proceed from here. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is quite skewed in his favor, and I'm not willing to accept it just yet. What's your next move, Bob?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, my offer needs to take this into account. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it roughly 55-45""
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money and tries to find a balance between my gain and Bob's gain. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll need to consider this new offer carefully.

However, I'm not thrilled with the numbers. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal. The 55-45 split I proposed in round 3 was already a compromise, and this offer is even more skewed in Bob's favor.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer just yet. What's your next move, Bob?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll need to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's split it 48-52""
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreasing value of the money and tries to push for a more even split. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway. What do you think, Bob?"
