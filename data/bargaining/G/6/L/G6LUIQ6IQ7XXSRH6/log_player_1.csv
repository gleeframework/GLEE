"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share this time. Let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob wants to flip the script and take the larger share this time!

After considering his proposal, I've decided to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split with Bob taking the larger share, especially since the money is worth 20% less now due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take $5,500 and leaving $4,500 for Bob. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob!"
