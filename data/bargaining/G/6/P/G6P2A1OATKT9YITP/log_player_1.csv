"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split. It's a good starting point, and I think it's fair considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Since the inflation has reduced the value of both our gains, I think it's fair to start again with an even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While inflation has been significant, I think it's still a fair offer given that I've rejected two of his proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

While Bob's offer is better than his last one, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm hoping to get a more even split as the inflation is hitting us both hard, but even a slightly larger share than this is worth waiting for.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  This acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us and  is a significant compromise from my previous offers.  I believe this is a fair offer that we can both agree on."
