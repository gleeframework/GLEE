"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly, or I'll make a better offer next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself, with a message encouraging him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a fairer split.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I would gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: 400000 * 0.95 = 380000
Bob's gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You said it's a fairer split, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you agree!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio slightly in my favor, but still offering a significant amount to Bob."
