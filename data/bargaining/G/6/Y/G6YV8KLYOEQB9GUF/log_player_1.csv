"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given the large amount of money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. My offer will be based on this reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take the majority, but I'm not giving up yet. I'll give you 580k, and I'll take 420k. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 10% reduction in value due to inflation, and I'm still trying to negotiate a 42-58 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting greedy, you're getting desperate. This is my best offer 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. Giving up 900k is unacceptable, considering the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking control 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my dwindling options.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
