"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 80-20 in my favor.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting your 80-20 offer. I'll offer a 60-40 split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less already!

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, a 60-40 split is a bit more generous than I initially offered, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 40% of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. So, the total amount is now worth 90% of its original value.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob. 55-45 split. Let's make a deal.""
}
```"
