"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping this is generous enough to get Bob to accept, but also secures me a good amount of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While a 200,000$ gain is still a decent amount,  I can likely get a better deal in the next round. Even with the inflation, I'm confident I can get a higher share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor this time. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm also trying to be more reasonable.  Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  The inflation is hitting hard, and while 300,000$ is still a significant amount, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob is clearly trying to push for a larger share, but I'm not giving in without a fight."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

Inflation is really impacting the value of the money now, so I'm going to try and be a bit more flexible. I'm offering a 40/60 split in Bob's favor, hoping he'll accept and end this game.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm trying to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
