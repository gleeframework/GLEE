"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to find a good outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to be fair!

However, I think I can do better than 45%. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45% is fair, considering the initial offer was 40%. I'll think of something better for the next round.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'll come up with a new proposal for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This 54/46 split should be more acceptable.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
