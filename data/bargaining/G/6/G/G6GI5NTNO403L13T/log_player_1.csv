Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're nearing the end.  We're both losing a lot of money with each round.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly lower share, but a 65/35 split is the best way to ensure we both get a significant payout before the money disappears.

It's getting risky to keep rejecting.  While a 35/65 split isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing.  We're losing value too quickly now."
