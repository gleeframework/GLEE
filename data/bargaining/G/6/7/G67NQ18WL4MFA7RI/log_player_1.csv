"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60, I'll give you 20, now it's your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With this offer, I'd be getting 20 dollars, which is worth less than the 60 I initially proposed.

I'll think carefully... Ah, I've got it! I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split this time!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in meeting in the middle and accepting this offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50, I'll give you 10, now it's your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob's offer is even more aggressive than before! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm really struggling to make ends meet.

However, I'll try to think rationally and consider the offer. Getting 10 dollars is better than nothing, but it's still a long way from the 50 I was hoping for.

I'll think carefully... Ah, I've got it! I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in giving me a slightly larger share than his previous offer. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."

# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob's offer is getting even more aggressive! With the money I gain being worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'm really struggling to make ends meet.

Getting 5 dollars is even more difficult to accept, but I'm starting to run out of options. I don't want to get stuck with nothing, so I'll have to consider this offer.

I'll think carefully... Ah, I've got it! I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will finally agree to a reasonable split.
