"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping to secure a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm losing nothing from inflation in this round, I'm still being offered a drastically worse deal than my initial proposal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a deal where I'm getting so much less than Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this round.  I've lowered my demands from the first round, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  This should be a more reasonable proposal, considering the inflation factor and Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation has clearly impacted Bob's gains more significantly than mine.  Accepting this offer means I secure at least 40%, which is a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
