"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll calculate my gain as 50 / 0.8 = 62.5

And since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he'll gain 50 / 0.95 = 52.63

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a decent one. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
