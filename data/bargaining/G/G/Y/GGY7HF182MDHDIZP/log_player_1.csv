"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering you 40% of the original $10,000, and keeping 60% for myself. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the original amount. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I'm offering you a slightly more generous share this time, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain. What do you think?"
