"Round 1

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and let Bob have 100,000 dollars. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation! I'll reject his offer. It's a lot less than what I was initially offered, and I'm sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars. This is still a generous offer considering the inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I've lost a significant amount of purchasing power due to inflation, his offer is far below what I could have gotten initially. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's clear that we both need to compromise given the impact of inflation. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer."
