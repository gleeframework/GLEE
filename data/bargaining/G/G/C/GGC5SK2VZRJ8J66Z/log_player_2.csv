"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early to accept a 50/50 split. There's a chance I can get a better deal later, especially if I'm the one making the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit less to be the one setting the terms. Let's see if you're open to a more favorable split for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better than the initial 50/50 split, and since I don't know the exact inflation rate for her, it's possible that this is the best I'll get. Accepting now ensures I get at least something, and it prevents further rounds where I risk losing out entirely."
