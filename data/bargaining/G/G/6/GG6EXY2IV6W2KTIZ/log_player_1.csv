"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after inflation, I'll get $480,000 (0.8 x $600,000) if I accept Bob's offer. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 40% less after two rounds of inflation (0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64), I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and leave $450,000 for Bob."
