"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the $100, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly worse deal, but I think this is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
