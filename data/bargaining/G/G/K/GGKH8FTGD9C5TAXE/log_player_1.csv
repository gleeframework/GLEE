"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so $4,000 is actually worth $3,600 in real terms.

Bob's offer is $6,000, which is worth 20% less than the original $7,500 he would have gained in the first round, so it's worth $6,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500, which is a slightly larger share than before, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so $4,500 is actually worth $3,273.90 in real terms.

Bob's offer is $5,000, which is worth 48.8% less than the original $9,800 he would have gained in the first round, so it's worth $5,000 in real terms.

Since Bob is offering me $5,000, which is equal to what he's offering himself, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. However, I'm also considering that if I reject this offer, the money will continue to decrease in value, and I might end up with less in future rounds. I'll accept the offer.
