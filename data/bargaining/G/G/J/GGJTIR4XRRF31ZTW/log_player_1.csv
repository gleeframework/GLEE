"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $10,000 and giving Bob $1,000. This is a relatively small amount for Bob, so he might be willing to accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. The even split is a good starting point, but I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, Bob. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""
}
```

I'm offering to take a slightly smaller share this time, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
