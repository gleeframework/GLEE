Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a slightly more even split, 51/49 in my favor. Let's be fair, but remember, inflation is a factor. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
