"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose taking $90 and giving Bob $10. This seems like a fair starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is being very greedy! I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to be a bit more flexible with my offer. $80 for me and $20 for Bob seems reasonable, considering the inflation. It's a compromise that gives Bob a bit more than before, while still securing me a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. I will reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob needs to understand that the inflation is affecting me more, and we need to reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach. I'll offer Bob a bit more, $30, while still securing a significant share for myself. Maybe this will convince him to compromise and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
