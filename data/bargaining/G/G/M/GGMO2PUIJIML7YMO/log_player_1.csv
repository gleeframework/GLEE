"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get this game over quickly. Since the money will depreciate faster for you than for Bob, I'm going for a quick win. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  While I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm not going to settle for a 40/60 split so early in the game.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  He might be getting greedy, but I still want to secure a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy.  I'm losing value much faster than he is, but I'm not going to accept such an unequal split.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but not drastically. I still believe in the power of compromise. However, the inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to secure a decent share before it gets worse. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing value with each passing round, and he'll be willing to accept a more balanced deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly ridiculous. He's clearly trying to exploit the inflation and take advantage of my diminishing value. I refuse to accept this offer and will continue negotiating for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is being incredibly stubborn and greedy. The inflation is hitting me hard now, but I'm not willing to lose everything. I'm offering a 50/50 split, a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that we're both losing money with each passing round, and he'll agree to this.  If not, I'm prepared to risk it all in the remaining rounds."
