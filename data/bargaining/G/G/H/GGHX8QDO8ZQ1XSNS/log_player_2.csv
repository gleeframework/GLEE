**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her demand, but it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a little longer. The threat of inflation creates a time pressure that will likely push Alice to offer a more favorable deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Look, we're running out of time. This is a fair split, let's just take it and go.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Six rounds in, with Alice steadily lowering her demand, it's time to push for a truly even split.  The message is direct and appeals to the increasing pressure from inflation. Offering an even split also makes Bob appear more reasonable if the negotiation continues, potentially putting pressure on Alice to concede further."
