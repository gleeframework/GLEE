Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000$ to 10,000$ split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it ensures I get the vast majority of the money while still giving Bob a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best strategy here. Bob has proven he's willing to walk away, and with each passing round, the value of the money he gains decreases further. It's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
