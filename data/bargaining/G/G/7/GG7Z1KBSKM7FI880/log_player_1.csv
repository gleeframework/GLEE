"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, a fair and simple division of the $100. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation reducing the value of my gain, I'd like to try to get a better deal. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively small difference, and I don't want to risk going to the next round if I can get a decent deal now.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
