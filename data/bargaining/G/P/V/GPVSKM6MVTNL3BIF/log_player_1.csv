"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer.  I'll take the majority, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount. Since I'm unsure about the inflation effect on Bob, I'm starting with a relatively large offer to encourage him to accept. I'll see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer was for him. I'm not going to accept this deal.  I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 85 for me and 15 for Bob.  Since I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Bob, I'm going to be cautious and try to keep the deal relatively close to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my initial offer was for him, and the inflation is making it worse. I'm going to keep rejecting until I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept a deal that's closer to what he offered in the previous round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm not going to cave in yet. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm increasing my offer again. The inflation is starting to be a real factor now, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. I'm hoping that Bob will start to realize that the longer we go on, the less money we both will get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm still feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal.  I'm starting to think I might need to take a bit more of a risk and make a more aggressive offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to take a risk and make a more aggressive offer. I'm going to offer Bob 45, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. The inflation is starting to seriously hurt, and I need to get a deal done soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation is hitting me hard, I'm going to accept this offer. It's not great, but it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. The longer this goes on, the less money we both get, and I'm afraid Bob might make a more aggressive offer in the next round that I wouldn't be able to accept."
