"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small taste of the money to keep you interested""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but still a significant one, to keep him engaged in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm hoping for more in the long run 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of the money!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if 4000 is enough for me. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the possibility of getting a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my offer in round 1, and I rejected his offer in round 2, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time around.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, but I'm willing to give you a small share. Don't expect much more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the money now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if 4500 is a good deal for me. I'll have to think carefully about whether I can do better in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my offer in round 3, and I rejected his offer in round 4, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer this time around.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, take it or leave it. I'm not getting any younger""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if 3500 is a good deal for me. I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer, but I'll think for a moment...

Hmm... I've rejected Bob's offers a few times, and I'm not sure if I can do better. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to end up with nothing.
