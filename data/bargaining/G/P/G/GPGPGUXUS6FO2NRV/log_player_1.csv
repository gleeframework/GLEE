I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm hoping to get the most out of this deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm offering 85% to myself and 15% to Bob. It's still a good deal for me, especially since the money is worth less now. I hope this is enough to convince him to accept."
