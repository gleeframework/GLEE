Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this is a reasonable proposal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the impact of inflation is significant, accepting Alice's offer would mean losing a substantial amount of the potential gain. It's worth taking a risk and making one final counter-offer.  If Alice is reasonable, she'll understand that accepting a smaller share now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is the absolute floor for me considering the circumstances.  Let's end this here and both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming extreme. While this offer represents a significant decrease from our desired outcome, it's better to secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all if Alice rejects this offer and we enter another round. This offer attempts to balance the impact of inflation with the risk of losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the extreme impact of inflation on your gains, I believe this is a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation has reached a critical point. While Alice's offer is far from ideal, accepting it will still yield a positive return. Rejecting it means risking getting nothing at all in further rounds, as the value of Bob's potential earnings continues to plummet. It's a difficult decision, but at this stage, it's the most rational choice to cut losses and secure some gain."
