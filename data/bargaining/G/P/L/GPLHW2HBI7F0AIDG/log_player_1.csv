"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}

I'm offering Bob 60% of the initial $10,000, and I'll take 40%. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid a potentially contentious negotiation."
