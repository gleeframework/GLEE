"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the effective amount I would gain is $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the effective amount is $360,000 * 0.9 = $324,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share myself, but I think this is a good compromise given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the effective amount I would gain is $500,000 * 0.727 = $363,500.

I'll consider Bob's offer. I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share, but I'll think about it.
