60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can work from there if you like.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"You wanted 60, I'll start with 80. Your turn!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share, but 80/20 is too unbalanced.  Let's find a middle ground. I propose 55/45,  a compromise that accounts for inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"You compromised, now it's my turn to push for a better deal. 70/30, it's a fair offer considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
45.0,55.0,We're both losing value with each round. Let's meet in the middle again. 45/55 reflects the current inflation and allows us both to get something.,Alice,5,
