  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}

Round 2

# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is now worth 80% of the original $8,000, and Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth 95% of the original $3,150.

I'm not too fond of Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
