"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher. Given the inflation, I'd rather take a 50-50 split now than risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
