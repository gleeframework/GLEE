"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a lion's share, but that's not how fair play works. I'm offering a more balanced split. Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking, and the money is literally shrinking for me. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
