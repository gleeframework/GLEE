"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of $600,000, which is $570,000. Bob's gain is still $400,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. In the second round, my gain was $450,000, so in the third round, it's worth 95% of that, which is $427,500.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 427500,
  ""bob_gain"": 572500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the fourth round. In the first round, my gain was $600,000. With 3 rounds of 5% inflation, the total inflation is 1.0525 (1 + 0.05 + 0.05^2 + 0.05^3). So, my gain in the fourth round is $600,000 * 0.8525 = $512,500.

Since Bob's offer is for $400,000, which is more than my gain in the fourth round, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. In the first round, my gain was $600,000. With 4 rounds of 5% inflation, the total inflation is 1.0525^4 = 1.2156. So, my gain in the fifth round is $600,000 * 0.8156 = $489,36.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 489360,
  ""bob_gain"": 510640
