"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount. This way, we both have a chance to negotiate and make a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, Alice. It's the most equitable way to start the game.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually equivalent to $4,000 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a bit too harsh for me, considering the initial offer I made was already a relatively generous one. However, I'm willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually equivalent to $4,000 in the first round.

Considering the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that's slightly more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating with you.""
}
```"
