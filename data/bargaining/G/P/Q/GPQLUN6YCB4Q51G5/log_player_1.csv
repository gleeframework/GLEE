```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiation skills 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'd rather not meet him in the middle, especially since I think my negotiation skills are just as valuable as his. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round.
