"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the negotiations quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, the numbers are now:

* Alice's gain: 100,000
* Bob's gain: 900,000

I'll have to think carefully about this... 

I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting higher!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a fair split, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in compromising and accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the numbers!

Considering the inflation, the numbers are now:

* Alice's gain: 50,000 (which is actually 5% of the original $1,000,000)
* Bob's gain: 950,000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to keep going back and forth. I'll have to accept this offer.
