"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 80/20, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and equal split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, let's negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $10 is worth 20% less than the $80 I proposed in the first round, which is equivalent to $16.

I'm not thrilled with the 10/90 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
