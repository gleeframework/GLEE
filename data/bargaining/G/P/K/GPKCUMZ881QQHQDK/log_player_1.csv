"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the new amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 x 0.8 = 320000
* Bob gain: 600000 x 0.8 = 480000

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
