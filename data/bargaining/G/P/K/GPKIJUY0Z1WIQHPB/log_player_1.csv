Let's see if Bob is happy with taking the smaller share in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure what's going on with Bob's offer, but it's definitely not good for me.  I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'm going to try to stay close to my original offer,  but I need to account for the inflation.  Let's see if Bob's greed is starting to get the best of him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a lot better than it initially seems.  It's not ideal, but it's better than losing everything."
