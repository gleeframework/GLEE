"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you still get a decent piece. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I reject the offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 20% less in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take that risk to potentially increase my share. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the decreasing value of money.""}\n\n###\nI've made an offer that gives me a larger share than Alice initially proposed, but still gives her the majority of the money. I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less in this round, so I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not being too greedy. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\n###"
