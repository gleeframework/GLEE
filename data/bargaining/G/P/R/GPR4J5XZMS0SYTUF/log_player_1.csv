I propose that you, Alice, receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping we can reach a compromise that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Let's both get a good chunk of the money, and hopefully avoid further inflation."
