This is a very close call.  The inflation is hurting Bob a lot more than it is hurting Alice. While Alice is down to 70.17% of the original value of her money, Bob is down to just 20.97% of the original value of his money. If Alice keeps rejecting, there is a very high chance they will both get nothing."
