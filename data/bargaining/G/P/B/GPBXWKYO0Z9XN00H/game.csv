9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%.  Let's get this done quickly!,Alice,1,

3000.0,7000.0,Your turn Alice. I think a 70/30 split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.  Let's close this out.,Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a decent amount to make this worthwhile.  Let's go with a 60/40 split.  It's fairer than your last offer and still gives you a good chunk of the money.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want this money. 65/35 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking.",Bob,4,
