Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 52, I'll take 48.  The clock is ticking, and the money is literally disappearing. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Delaying further significantly erodes any potential gains, especially for me (Alice) with the higher inflation rate.
* **Bob's Movement:** Bob has moved slightly in my favor from his initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate, albeit slowly. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds is incredibly risky. The money we'd be fighting over would be significantly less, making the potential gain not worth the risk of walking away with nothing. 

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than to risk getting nothing later."
