Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer!  I'm starting with a high share for myself, but leaving some for him to encourage acceptance.  We'll see how the inflation plays out in later rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not going to give in to his greed this early in the game. I know I have the power to make a better proposal next round. I'm going to see if I can get a bigger piece of the pie, especially since inflation is starting to kick in."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's previous counter-offer.  I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to back down easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly aggressive. I'm still not going to give in to his demands.  The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm holding out for a better deal. I'll try to find a way to make a more appealing proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm getting a bit nervous with the inflation, but I'm still holding onto a decent chunk of the money.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that I'm not just going to accept whatever he throws at me. This is a negotiation, and I'm playing to win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm still not going to give in to Bob's pressure. His offers are getting increasingly lopsided, but I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep pushing. I'll make another counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is making things difficult, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money. I need to make a strong counter-offer to show Bob that I'm not going to let him take advantage of the situation. This is a high-stakes negotiation, and I'm determined to get the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not giving in to Bob's pressure, even though the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money. It's time to get creative and maybe try a different strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard now, and we are both losing value with every passing round. I'm proposing an even split to see if Bob is finally willing to compromise. This is my last chance to get a decent amount of money before the inflation completely wipes out our potential gains. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
