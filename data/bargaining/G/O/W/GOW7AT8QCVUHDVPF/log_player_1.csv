"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll take a chance and see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than the initial $100, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since Bob is suggesting a 50-50 split, I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round and another 20% less after the second round, my gain is now worth 40% of the initial $100. I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up with me! With the money worth 48.8% less than the initial $100, my gain is now a mere 51.2% of the original amount.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do a bit better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

}

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'm running out of options. The amount I'll get is relatively small, but it's better than getting nothing. I'll accept the offer.
