Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. Your last offer was ridiculous.  I'm proposing a more reasonable 60/40 split. Take it or watch your share shrink. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
