"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage he faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $80 for myself and $20 for Bob. While I still want a larger share, I recognize that Bob has a higher inflation rate and needs to be compensated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is better than the last round.  With further rounds, his inflation rate will make his offers even less appealing."
