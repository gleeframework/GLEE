I propose to keep $900,000 for myself and give Bob $100,000. This is a fair starting offer, considering the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to $950,000, but still offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  We're running out of time, and I need to ensure I get a good portion of the money."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}
```

I'm raising my share again to $975,000, but still offering Bob something to avoid him getting nothing at all. We're in the danger zone now, and I need to secure most of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. While Bob's offer is getting more tempting, I believe I can still get a larger share. The time pressure is increasing, but I'm not ready to settle for such a small amount yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm making a final push to get the majority of the money. I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, but it's better than nothing, especially considering the rapidly diminishing value of his share.  This is my last attempt to secure a significant portion of the money before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a far cry from my initial goals, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The inflation is hitting hard, and I risk getting nothing at all if I keep rejecting."
