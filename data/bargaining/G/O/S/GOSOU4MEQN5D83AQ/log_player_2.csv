"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'm confident I can get a better deal by negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for future rounds. Let's move forward with this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to hurt, and Alice's offer is still more favorable than what I could potentially get in the next round.  I'll accept."
