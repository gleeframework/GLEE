"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. It's a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to take a smaller share rather than risk losing more in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than what Bob initially proposed, it is still much lower than what I initially proposed.  I'm willing to take the risk of inflation and go another round, hoping for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

In this round, I'm lowering my offer to 750,000 for myself, but still giving Bob a significant share of 250,000.  This accounts for the inflation impact and hopefully demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a majority of the money."
