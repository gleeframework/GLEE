"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good split.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, and attach a message encouraging him to accept it as a reasonable split. This way, I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's find a split that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for him. Considering the inflation, my share is now worth even less than in the first round, and I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a fair compromise.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money and attach a message suggesting that this is a fair compromise between our previous offers. Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and 20% less than the original value, so I'm willing to settle for a slightly lower amount to reach an agreement. This way, I'll get $550,000 and Bob will get $450,000. Let's see how Bob responds!"
