**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Alice with each round. Waiting longer means a smaller potential gain, even if she manages to get a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. This suggests he's unlikely to budge much in future rounds. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Alice a reasonable sum. Rejecting risks getting a much worse deal in a later round if Bob stays firm.

While Alice could gamble on getting a slightly better deal, the risk of losing more to inflation and a potentially stubborn Bob makes accepting the current offer the safest and most pragmatic choice."
