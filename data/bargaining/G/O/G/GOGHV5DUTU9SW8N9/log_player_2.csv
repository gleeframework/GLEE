Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think 60/40 is still a little too skewed in your favor.  Let's try 60/40, but with the roles reversed.  I think this is a fairer compromise given the inflation situation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
