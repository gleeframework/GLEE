4000.0,6000.0,I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.,Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think 60/40 is still a little too skewed in your favor.  Let's try 60/40, but with the roles reversed.  I think this is a fairer compromise given the inflation situation.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to a 55/45 split.  I think this is a good compromise that accounts for the inflation.,Bob,4,
