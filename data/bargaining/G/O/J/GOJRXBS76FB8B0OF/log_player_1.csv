I propose to take 9000 dollars and give Bob 1000 dollars.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try a slightly more even split this time.  8000 for me, 2000 for Bob."
