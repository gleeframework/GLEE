I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and giving 100,000$ to Bob. This seems fair, as I am the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose taking 800,000$ for myself and giving 200,000$ to Bob.  While I would prefer more, I need to account for the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer."
