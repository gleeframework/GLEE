"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the majority. Accept this and we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 5% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she has an incentive to make a more favorable offer to me as the rounds progress. I'll take my chances and see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair!""}\n\nI'm making this offer because I believe it's a fair split, considering we both want to get something out of this deal. Since the money is worth 5% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she might be willing to accept this offer to avoid losing more value in the future rounds. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. This is a 50/50 split, and it's the best we can do with the inflation 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not accepting this offer because, although it seems like a 50/50 split, the effects of inflation are on Alice's side, and the value of her half is actually less than mine. Since I have more rounds to negotiate and Alice is losing value each round, I think I can get an even better deal in the next rounds.\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more fair offer now. You're losing value each round, and I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more to get this done. This is a fair split given the inflation we've both been experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, although Alice is willing to compromise, the effects of inflation are still on her side, and the value of her share is actually less than mine. Since I have more rounds to negotiate and Alice is losing value each round, I think I can get an even better deal in the next rounds. The fact that she's willing to compromise now suggests that she's getting anxious to close the deal, which gives me more leverage. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe this offer is more than fair. Each round, the value of your potential gain decreases, and I'm taking on the risk of walking away with nothing if we can't agree. It's time to be realistic about the value we're both getting.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting tight. I'm willing to concede more to avoid getting nothing, but this is my final offer. If we don't agree, we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share and her willingness to concede more, this seems like the best deal I can get without risking walking away with nothing. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and given the decreasing value of her share, it's likely she won't go higher. I've managed to negotiate a better deal than the initial offer, and it's time to close the deal before we both lose out."
