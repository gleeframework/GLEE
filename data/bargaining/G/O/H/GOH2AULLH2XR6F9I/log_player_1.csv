I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! I'm not going to accept such a drastically unfair offer.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time.  Since Bob is being so unreasonable, I'll offer an even split to see if he's willing to compromise."
