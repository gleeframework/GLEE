"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving Bob $200,000 and me $800,000. I'm framing it as a ""good deal"" to try to entice Bob to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, but I'll give you a decent one! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I'm not convinced yet!""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 2:3 split, and I'm giving Bob a hint that I'm not ready to give up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation affecting my gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55:45 split, trying to squeeze a bit more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the best deal, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not satisfied with the 25:75 split, and I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, let's keep negotiating!""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer and will try to negotiate further to get a better deal."

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 45:55 split, trying to take a bit more from Bob, but I'm aware that this might be a tough sell."
