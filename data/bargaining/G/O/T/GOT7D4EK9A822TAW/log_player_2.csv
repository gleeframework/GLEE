**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to consider inflation, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer we wait, the more I lose due to inflation. Accepting a deal significantly below 50% now would leave me with a drastically smaller sum compared to Alice's, even if her offer appears slightly better. It's time to signal I'm willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option now.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

We're reaching a critical point. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal due to the accumulated inflation, it's the strongest signal I can send that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  Alice is very likely to reject anything less favorable to her, and with only a few rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing dramatically increases.  This offer puts the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before time runs out for both of us."
