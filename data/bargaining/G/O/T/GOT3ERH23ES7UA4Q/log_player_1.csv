"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me 99% of the money, while Bob receives 1%. While it might seem unfair, it's a high starting point that I believe will incentivize Bob to accept, especially considering the upcoming inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation has already significantly decreased the value of my potential gains.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable sum, which is better than risking further losses in subsequent rounds."
