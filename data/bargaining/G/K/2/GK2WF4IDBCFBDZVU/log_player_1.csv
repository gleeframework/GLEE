"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the inflation. I'd like to aim for a higher amount to account for the decreasing value of the money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this round, but let's keep the negotiation fair and avoid risking further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd like to push for a higher share to compensate for the losses due to inflation."
