I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since it's the first round, I'm hoping Bob will be more likely to accept a smaller share to avoid risking getting nothing at all if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is significantly better than the 10% I would have gotten if I rejected his offer.  Even with the 10% inflation, a 50/50 split is a much better outcome for me."
