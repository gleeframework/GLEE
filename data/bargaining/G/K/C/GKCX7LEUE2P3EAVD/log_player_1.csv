"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to capitalize on the reduced value of the money and put pressure on him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to be careful!

Considering the reduced value of the money I gain in this round (14.26% less than the original $1,000,000), I'll calculate the actual value of the money I gain:

$400,000 / 0.855 (1 - 0.1426) = $469,048

It's a decent offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the continued inflation and the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of the money and put pressure on him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm taking the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money I gain in this round (22.62% less than the original $1,000,000), I'll calculate the actual value of the money I gain:

$100,000 / 0.7774 (1 - 0.2262) = $128,543

It's a very small share, and I'm not thrilled about it. However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm taking the smaller share, but I'm hoping that the game is over, and I can finally get my hands on some cash!"
