"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  This offer is still fair, but it gives us both a bit more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal, the inflation is starting to hurt.  50/50 is a fair compromise, and it's better than losing more money to inflation."
