"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and give Bob $450,000. I've attached a message ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Waiting for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly, but I'll take the bigger share this time.  
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}


I've reduced my initial offer to $520,000 and increased Bob's share to $480,000, trying to find a compromise. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. Waiting for Bob's response!"
