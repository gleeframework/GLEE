"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll get the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's see if you accept this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my perception of the offer accordingly.

In this round, Bob's offer is equivalent to $47.50 (50 / 0.95) for me, and $50 for Bob.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
