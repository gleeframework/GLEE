"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90% and leaving Bob with 10%. Since we have 12 rounds, I want to start strong and see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but not that small. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll offer Bob 20% this time. While I still want a bigger share, I'm willing to compromise a little to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation is starting to hurt. However, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm still trying to get the most I can, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time and the increasing inflation. I'll offer Bob 25% this time, hoping he'll see it's in his best interest to accept before we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting desperate. Inflation is severely impacting the value of my earnings, and I'm afraid we'll end up with nothing.  I'll accept Bob's offer, even though it's a 50/50 split.  It's better than nothing."
