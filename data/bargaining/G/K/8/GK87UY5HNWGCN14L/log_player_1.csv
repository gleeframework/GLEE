"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in the new terms.

With the 10% inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 50 / 1.1 = 45.45 in the original terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
