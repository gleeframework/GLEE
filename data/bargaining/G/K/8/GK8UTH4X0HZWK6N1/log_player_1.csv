"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take 900,000 for myself and give Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given that we both lose value over time.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I don't like the outcome, I'm going to reject this offer. Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try and get a much larger share. I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. While the inflation is impacting me more, I still need to get a reasonable share. This is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
