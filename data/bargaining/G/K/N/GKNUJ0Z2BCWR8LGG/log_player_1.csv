"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6000 gain from the first round is now worth less, so I'm even more eager to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 42-58 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50-50 split, but still gives me a slightly better deal due to the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
