Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your proposal, but I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fairer given the inflation and the fact that we're now both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's crucial to remember that the value of the money is decreasing faster for me. Accepting a 45/55 split in this round means I'm getting significantly less than what that amount represented in Round 1. I need to push for a better deal while it's still worthwhile."
