**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  While her offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal. The difference between her offer now and a potential deal closer to 50/50 is worth the risk of further inflation."
