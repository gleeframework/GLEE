"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, with me getting 80% of the initial $100 and Bob getting 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same amount as in the previous round, but Bob's offer is worth 5% less than in the previous round.

I accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair 50:50 split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
