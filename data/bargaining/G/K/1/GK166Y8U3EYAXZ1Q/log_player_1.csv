This is a tough one!  Bob is starting to chip away with his offers, but I'm still holding out hope for a better deal.  I'm betting he'll get more generous as we get closer to the deadline."

It's painful, but I have to accept.  While it's less than I hoped for, getting only $400,000 is better than getting nothing if we run out of time. Bob knows the pressure is on and he's using it to his advantage."
