Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and her offers are not reflecting the rapid devaluation of her potential gains. While her offers might seem appealing at face value, I need to push for a larger share before inflation eats away at her side of the deal, making her more likely to accept a more favorable split for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is not your friend. This is my final offer - take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice needs to understand the gravity of the situation. By offering a 60/40 split in my favor and framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, I'm increasing the pressure on her to accept. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for her, and she'll likely be forced to accept a worse deal later."
