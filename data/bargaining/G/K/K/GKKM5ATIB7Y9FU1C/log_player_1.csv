Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I believe this offer is more equitable. Let's end this game and split the money fairly. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's end this now before the inflation hits us both harder. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, his offer is still not in my best interest.  I need to hold out for a larger share, knowing that each round makes my potential gains (from my perspective) more valuable than his."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 625000,
""bob_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse. Take this offer before inflation makes it even less appealing for you. Let's wrap this up!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying a bit more pressure this round. Bob's offers are slowly increasing, indicating his awareness of the inflation. By slightly decreasing my demand, I'm acknowledging his position while still aiming for a favorable outcome. The assertive tone might push him to accept."
