Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This offer is a good compromise. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's end this now before the inflation hits us both harder.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse. Take this offer before inflation makes it even less appealing for you. Let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's significantly less than I initially hoped for, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  Inflation is eating away at my gains rapidly, and continuing to reject offers will only worsen my outcome."
