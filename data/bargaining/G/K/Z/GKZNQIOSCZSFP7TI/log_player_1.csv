  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Still a decent offer, but I can try to do better.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal than your last offer, but don't expect it to be 50/50!""

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is worth about 30.2% of what it was in the first round. It's getting tougher to make ends meet.
