"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. Maybe I can get an even better deal!"

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40!""
