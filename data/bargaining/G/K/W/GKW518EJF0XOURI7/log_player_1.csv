"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  After all, I want to maximize my gains, and the longer the game goes on, the more value I lose due to inflation.  Let's see if he takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I'm still losing money due to inflation, but I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the first round, but I'm still confident that Bob will find it more appealing than his own offer. Inflation is working against him, and he's losing value faster than I am.  Let's see if he takes the bait this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my own proposal, especially considering the significant inflation we're facing. I'm determined to keep playing and see if I can secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm further reducing my offer, but it's still a decent deal for Bob considering the inflation. He's losing value at a much faster rate than I am, and I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being more equitable, it's still not good enough for me. The inflation is hitting him hard, and I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm not giving up just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but I'm still giving Bob a fair share considering the extreme inflation. He's losing value at an alarming rate, and I believe he'll be forced to accept this offer soon rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me. While the inflation is taking a significant toll on both of us, I am determined to secure a better deal for myself. I believe I can still get a more favorable outcome by continuing to play and making counter-offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

The inflation is starting to really hurt, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm reducing my offer again, but I believe Bob is starting to feel the pressure. He's losing value much faster than I am, and I think this offer will be hard to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a risky move.  I'm getting very close to the deadline and the inflation is killing both of us.  I'm lowering my offer one last time, hoping that Bob realizes this might be his best chance to get anything at all.  If he rejects it, we're both getting nothing, which is a terrible outcome for both of us.  Let's see if he takes the bait."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 540000 
# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision.  While Bob's offer is not as good as I would like, it's better than getting nothing at all.  The inflation has been absolutely brutal, and I'm losing value at an alarming rate.  I'm forced to accept this offer, even though it's not ideal.  It's better to take what I can get than risk losing everything."
