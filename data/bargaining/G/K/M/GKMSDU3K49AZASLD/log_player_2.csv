"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose we split the money evenly.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I have an incentive to try to get more than half of the money. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45/55 is a fairer split considering the inflation affecting you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is still worth less and less for me with each passing round, I'll try to get an even better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round! Maybe I can get more than 55.\n\n###\n\nAlso, Alice seems to be aware of my situation with inflation, but she's not giving me a better offer. I'll try to use this to my advantage.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 67, ""alice_gain"": 33, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll! I need a bigger share to make up for the loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is affecting you, Bob. Let's try 40/60 this time. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we need to reach an agreement soon before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The money is already worth 34.39% less for me than in the first round, and this loss will only increase with each subsequent round. Alice's offer of 60/40 seems reasonable under these circumstances, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risk losing even more value."
