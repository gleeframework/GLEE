"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent share to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, it's a good start, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual values are:

* Alice's gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'll accept Bob's offer.
