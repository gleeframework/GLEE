"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob is offering me $2,000, which is a smaller share than I initially proposed, I'll consider this a relatively low offer. However, I still need to get a good chunk of the money to make this worth my while.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit low, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being more patient 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the situation.

Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, but the value of the money has decreased for him. I'm not sure if he's being more patient or just trying to get a better deal.

I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was similar to the previous one, and I'm not getting a better deal, I'll try to negotiate a better offer for myself. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being more aggressive in the negotiations. This is my best offer so far. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob an even smaller share, but I'm trying to get a better deal for myself. I'm making it a ""take it or leave it"" offer, so Bob will have to decide whether to accept it or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve a slight edge for being more patient and not giving in 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 40.95% less for Bob, I'll reassess the situation.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for Bob, I'm not sure if he's being serious about getting a ""slight edge"" or just trying to get a better deal.

I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.
