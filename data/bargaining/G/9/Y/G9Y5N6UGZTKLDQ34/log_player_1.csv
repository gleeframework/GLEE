"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to get the game started. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Waiting for another round risks a lower payout for me, and Bob will be the one making the next offer."
