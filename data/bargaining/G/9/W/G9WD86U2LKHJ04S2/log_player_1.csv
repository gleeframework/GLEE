"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. The remaining $900,000 will go to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think Bob is being too greedy. With inflation, the $300,000 I would gain is actually worth only $240,000 in real terms, and the $700,000 Bob would gain is worth $630,000. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
