"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a toll on the money's value, and now I'd have to settle for even less. Considering Bob's message, I'm not sure if he's being generous or just trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher percentage to Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this time. The inflation is affecting me more, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a bigger toll on my potential earnings! Considering Bob's message, I'm not sure if he's being sincere or just trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really affecting the value of the money now. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to get a decent share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 280000,
  ""bob_gain"": 720000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need a fair share. This is my best offer so far""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a higher percentage to Bob, but I really need to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
