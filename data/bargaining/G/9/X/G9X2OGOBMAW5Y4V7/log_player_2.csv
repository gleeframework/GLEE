Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try 59% for me and 41% for you. We need to reach a deal soon to minimize the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting desperate and is barely budging in her offers. It's clear she drastically undervalues the impact of inflation on her end. As long as I hold firm, I can secure a much better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest deal and ensures we both benefit before inflation causes further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to offer a split that seems fair on the surface while still being advantageous to me. Alice might be more receptive to a 50/50 split as it seems equitable, even though the inflation heavily favors me at this point. This offer creates a psychological pressure point, making it harder for her to justify further delays and risking a much smaller share later."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Back to my original offer, 60% for me and 40% for you. I think it's a good compromise given the inflation impact on my share 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is panicking. She's back to her initial offer, completely failing to recognize the significant advantage I now hold due to the inflation. This desperation signals that I can secure a much better deal by remaining patient."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you 450,000.  Take it before inflation erodes your share even further.  This is your last chance for a reasonable deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Apply Pressure:**  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the dwindling value of her potential earnings.  It's time to press this advantage and start moving the split more in my favor.
* **Final Offer:** By framing this as her ""last chance"" for a ""reasonable deal,"" I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and limit further haggling.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While the offer is weighted in my favor, it's still significantly better than what she'd get if we fail to reach an agreement. The offer is designed to be just tempting enough for her to accept while maximizing my gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 58% and you can have 42%. I think it's a good compromise given the substantial inflation impact on my share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to cut my losses. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is better than risking no deal at all.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this drags on, the less significant the difference in gains becomes. While I might squeeze out a tiny bit more in the next round or two, the potential increase isn't worth the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently shown a reluctance to offer anything beyond the low 40s.  It's unlikely this will change drastically in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting guarantees I walk away with something, which is better than the zero-sum outcome if we fail to reach a deal. 

While I'm confident I could secure a slightly better deal with more time, the risk associated with continued negotiation outweighs the potential reward at this point."
