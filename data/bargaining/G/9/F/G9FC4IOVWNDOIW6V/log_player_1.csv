"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're just starting out."

# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, especially since I had a better offer initially. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try 55/45!""}

I'm trying to get a bit more of the pie, but still leaving some room for Bob to get a decent share."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, 55/45 is a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think I've been too greedy so far, and Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept the 45/55 split to avoid going to the next round and risking an even worse deal."
