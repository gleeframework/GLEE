"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust later if we want. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more than 50%, accepting the offer is the best strategy in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value each round. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount before further losses.
* **Fairness:**  Bob's proposal is fair, and even though I'm losing a good chunk of my initial desired amount, it's a good starting point for potential negotiations. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting could lead to a worse outcome in the following rounds.  Bob might not be willing to budge further, and I could lose a lot more money due to inflation.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting seems like the safest way to get something in this situation."
