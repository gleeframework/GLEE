"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can adjust later if you think it's unfair.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's a very generous offer for yourself! How about we aim for something more balanced? This is my counter-offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a more balanced approach this time. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. We're both losing value with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
After two rounds, Alice is offering a much more reasonable split. Accepting ensures Bob gets something, whereas continued rejection risks getting a worse deal or even nothing as the money rapidly loses value.
