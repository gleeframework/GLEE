"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but consider the impact of inflation. This offer gives you a significant sum upfront, minimizing the effects of inflation over time. Let's be strategic! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
