"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight improvement, but I'm willing to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 540,000 (10% less than 600,000)
Bob's gain: 455,000 (5% less than 480,000, but I think there's a mistake, it should be 5% less than 400,000, which is 380,000)

I'll ignore the incorrect value and consider the correct one. I'll reject the offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 500,000$ and keeping 500,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to meet in the middle and end the game."
