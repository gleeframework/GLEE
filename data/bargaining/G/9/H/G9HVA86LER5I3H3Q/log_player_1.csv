"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting 5000$. But with the inflation, Bob's offer is worth 20% less, so he's only getting 4800$.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping he'll accept it."
