"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount compared to what I'm keeping for myself, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in ending the game quickly and getting something rather than risking losing everything if we don't reach a deal within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and avoids any potential for conflict. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk losing more value in future rounds. However, splitting it evenly doesn't give me a clear advantage, and I'm not sure if I should pass on this opportunity.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a larger share now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take this deal and avoid losing more value in future rounds!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a larger share of the remaining value."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's make a deal and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. A 60/40 split is a more generous offer from Bob, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Considering the value of the money is decreasing, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk losing more in future rounds.

However, I'm not sure if 60/40 is the best split for me. I'll have to think carefully about it.

  ""message"": ""Don't wait any longer, take this deal and secure your share!""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. If you reject it, we risk losing more value with each passing round. Let's end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting desperate to get a deal. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'd rather get a larger share, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money.

I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to give in.
