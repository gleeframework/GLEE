"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:** Starting with a 65/35 split in Alice's favor establishes a firm position. While it might not be immediately accepted, it sets a tone for negotiation. 
* **Considering Inflation:** Alice is hit harder by inflation (20% vs. Bob's 10%).  Securing a larger share now is crucial, as the value of potential future offers diminishes more rapidly for her.
* **Message:** The message aims to appear reasonable and encourage Bob to accept. By highlighting mutual benefit, it attempts to prevent immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering the inflation rate. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer significantly favors him. While inflation is a factor, accepting this deal would mean Alice loses a substantial amount compared to her initial proposal. 
* **Leveraging Time:**  While the value decreases with each round, Bob is also feeling the pressure of inflation, albeit at a slower rate. Rejecting this offer forces him to make a better deal in the next round.
* **Future Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, Alice can propose a counter-offer in the next round that is still more favorable to her than Bob's current proposal, while also accounting for the decreased value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This offer still gives you a good share, Bob, and avoids further losses for both of us due to inflation. Let's be practical.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand from the initial 650,000 but keeps her gain above 50%. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Highlighting Inflation:** The message again emphasizes the shared loss from inflation, urging Bob to settle. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Bob is likely feeling the pressure of the diminishing value, even if his rate is lower.  This offer, while still in Alice's favor, might be more tempting to him now."
