"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. It's a high risk, high reward strategy. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my previous one, but I think I can do better! I'm going to reject and see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of getting a decent share, even if it's not the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting a smaller share than I'd hoped for, this is better than the last round. Inflation is really biting into my potential gains, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer. It's time to take what I can get."
