Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. You're losing more to inflation each round than I am. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a classic negotiation tactic, highlighting my losses to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal. While it's true I'm affected by inflation more, his offer is still skewed towards him.  I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a fair share.  We're getting into riskier territory as rounds go on, but I'm banking on Bob becoming more willing to compromise as the deadline approaches."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer.  It's a fair split, and better than both of us getting nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. By framing this as my ""final offer"" and highlighting the very real risk of getting nothing, I'm hoping to push him towards a deal. I'm conceding slightly from my previous offer,  acknowledging we're both losing out as time passes. However, I'm holding firm on getting the larger share, as the inflation disparity means I'm making a bigger sacrifice in the long run."
