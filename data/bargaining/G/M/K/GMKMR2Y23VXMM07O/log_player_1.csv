Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid any future losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is more balanced and ensures we both get a good share before inflation hits harder. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is compromising, it's still tilted in his favor. Accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less than half the original value due to inflation, while he enjoys the full value of his share. I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Don't let greed make us both lose."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to push for a truly fair split. The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.  The strong message emphasizes the urgency of the situation."
