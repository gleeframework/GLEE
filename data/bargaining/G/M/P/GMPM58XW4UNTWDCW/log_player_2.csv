"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair-ish split. I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I need the majority for this to be worthwhile. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see what Alice's next offer will be.  Since I'm losing value more slowly than Alice, there's a good chance she'll be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split. I'm willing to give you 40%, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while.  We can always adjust if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take a smaller portion now to avoid further losses from inflation.  I'm confident we can reach a good agreement if we both compromise a bit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. While Alice is getting a larger share, the inflation rate is hitting her much harder. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money while minimizing the losses from inflation."
