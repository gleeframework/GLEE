"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, a fair split""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20, but I think it's a bit low 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less, so I'd get $18 (20 * 0.9) if I accept this offer. It's a decent offer, but I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a better split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more equal split this time, hoping Bob will accept!"
