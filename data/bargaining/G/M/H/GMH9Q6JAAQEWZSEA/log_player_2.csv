"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can negotiate more evenly in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is promising future fairness, there's no guarantee she'll follow through. It's better to push for a more reasonable split from the get-go."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It accounts for me taking the risk in later rounds if you don't negotiate fairly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor.  Given the inflation, accepting 450,000 now is a significant loss compared to what Bob could have gotten in the first round.  There's room for Alice to be more generous, especially with the clock ticking."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's meet closer to the middle. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is running out, and this is a fair offer considering the inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm tired of this back and forth. Let's split the money evenly and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally a fair offer! While ideally, Bob would have secured a slight advantage, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the smartest move.  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth, and risking it all for a slightly larger share isn't worth it anymore."
