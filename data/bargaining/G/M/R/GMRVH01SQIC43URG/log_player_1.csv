"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to accept a smaller share. However, I'm not too thrilled about taking only 20% of the remaining amount.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
