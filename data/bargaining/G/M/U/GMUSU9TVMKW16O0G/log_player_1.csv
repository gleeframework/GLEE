"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept quickly, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2. I'm not willing to give up that much money, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll wait for a better offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the need to get a good share of the money."
