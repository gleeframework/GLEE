"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a large share to start, but I'm also leaving a bit for Bob. This should encourage him to accept, but if he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round to account for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair. While my share is worth less due to inflation, his offer is still significantly worse than my initial proposal. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer to account for inflation, but I'm still going for a larger share. I believe this offer is more fair than Bob's previous proposal and should encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my share is significantly lower due to inflation, Bob's offer is the best I've seen yet.  Rejecting again might lead to further inflation, potentially making my share even smaller.  It's time to accept and secure what I can."
