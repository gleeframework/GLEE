"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but I'm hoping we can find something a bit more equitable. How about a 55/45 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and the difference in inflation is working in my favor. I need to push for a more significant change in the split, or I'll be stuck accepting a bad deal in a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and this isn't a fair split. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 52/48 split. This is a very reasonable offer considering the inflation working against me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your offers, Bob. 57-43 is my new proposal. Time is running out, think carefully. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the increasing inflation is severely impacting my potential earnings. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting any longer hoping for Alice to drop to 55/45 is risky. Even if she agrees by round 7 or 8, the inflation might have eaten into the gains, making the difference negligible.
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting guarantees a payout, even if less than initially hoped. Rejecting this offer carries the increasing risk of walking away with nothing.

It's a tough decision, but sometimes a less than perfect deal is better than no deal at all."
