"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, since we both value the money the same right now. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $50 I would gain is now worth 80% of the initial $50, which is $40.

I'm not too keen on splitting it evenly, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a bit more. However, Bob's offer is a reasonable one, and I'm not sure I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 64% of its initial value (80% of 80%). So, if I propose a gain of $40, that's actually $64.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I still think I deserve more.""
}
```"
