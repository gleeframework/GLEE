"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 30/70 split when the money is still worth the same for both of us. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, since we both value the money the same right now. It's the fairest way to start.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is now losing value on the money, so even though I'm getting more, I think it's a good deal."
