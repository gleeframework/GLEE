"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm taking a big hit on the value of my share with each round, so let's split it closer to 55/45. This ensures we both get a fair share before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
