I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000. This is a fair split considering we're both losing money each round. I'm willing to concede a larger portion this time, but it's important to ensure I secure a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal, I'm willing to accept this offer.  The inflation is getting increasingly problematic, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting."
