"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against me, Bob. Let's be reasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll consider Alice's offer.\n\n###\n\nGiven the inflation and the fact that this is Alice's final offer, I think I'll accept it. It's better to secure a guaranteed amount now rather than risking further negotiations.\n\n###\n\nHere's my decision:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet Alice know that I've accepted her offer!"
