It's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My share is losing value rapidly. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Current Offer:** A 50/50 split is fair in principle. While I was aiming for a bit more to offset inflation, Bob is unlikely to agree to anything significantly better given how long he's been holding out.  

Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even though it's less than I hoped for at the start."
