"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be friends""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and leave Bob with 40% ($400,000), along with a friendly message suggesting a peaceful resolution. The ball is now in Bob's court to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round, where he will make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer to split the money evenly, despite the friendly message. Given the effects of inflation, Alice's share would be worth even less than the initial offer, and Bob's proposed 60% for himself is likely seen as unfavorable by Alice. The game will proceed to the next round, where Alice will make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 55% of the money ($550,000) and leave Bob with 45% ($450,000), along with a message suggesting a compromise. Considering the effects of inflation, Alice is trying to find a middle ground that would be more acceptable to Bob while still favoring her own gain. The decision is now up to Bob to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
