"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and efficient. A slightly better deal for me now saves us both money in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair in the first round, I'm hoping for a better deal for myself. I'm going to reject and see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. You get less now, but you'll lose even more if we keep going.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer Bob, and time is running out. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is fair and we are losing money with each passing round. It's best to take the 500,000 now and avoid further losses."
