Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get this over with quickly.  I'm willing to give up a lot to avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my potential gains.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, I'm not sure I can do better than this.  The inflation is real, and the risk of getting nothing is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and take the 50% share."
