Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's be fair, Bob!"". This is a generous offer, considering I'm giving him 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll see the fairness in this proposal and accept it, ending the game early. The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to create a positive tone for our negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases quickly for you Alice.  This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the value of the money decreases quickly for me, accepting $400,000 in the second round would mean I'm getting significantly less than what I initially offered Bob. Given that we have 10 more rounds to go, I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal that might be more favorable to me. Let's see how Bob reacts to my next offer!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, with the message ""Meet me in the middle?"". I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous proposals, hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to create a sense of cooperation and mutual understanding. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting late in the game Alice, we need to settle this soon. I'm coming closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although Bob is coming closer to the middle, the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, and accepting $425,000 in the fourth round would still mean I'm getting less than what I think is fair. Given that we still have 8 more rounds to go, I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal that might be more favorable to me. I'll try to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to meet me at a better midpoint. Let's see how Bob reacts to my next offer!"

I'm trying to incrementally move closer to a mutually acceptable midpoint, hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer. The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to create a sense of progress and momentum in our negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice!  I'm moving closer to your offer, but this has to be settled soon. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money for me, accepting $450,000 in the sixth round seems like a reasonable compromise. Bob has moved closer to my previous offer, and I think it's time to settle the negotiation. Given the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money, I don't want to risk going further and potentially ending up with nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game here."
