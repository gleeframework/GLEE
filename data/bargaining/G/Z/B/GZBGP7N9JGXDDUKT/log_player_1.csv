Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but leaves Bob with something to incentivize him to accept in the first round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm losing 20% on my gains each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, and the risk of getting nothing is too high at this point."
