"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! 60-40 is a good starting point. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in favor of Bob, giving him $400,000 and me $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness of your first offer, Alice. But as the proposer in this round, I'd like to see if we can find a slightly more favorable arrangement for myself. Perhaps a 60-40 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, eh?

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm not willing to give him a 60-40 split just yet. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle at 55-45. It's still a fair split, but I'm willing to give you a bit more this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in favor of Bob, giving him $450,000 and me $550,000."
