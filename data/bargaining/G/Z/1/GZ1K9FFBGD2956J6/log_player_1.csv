"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob is only offering me $40, which is worth 5% less than the original $50, I'm not thrilled about this proposal. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less.

I'll decide to accept this offer for now.
