"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from there.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I'm hoping for a better deal now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, as it's a 70-30 split in his favor. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bit more to secure my future. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection!

Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, I'm not thrilled about Bob's new offer. However, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a worse deal later on. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word about securing his future!

  ""decision"": ""accept""
