"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about something closer to the middle? This way we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
