Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. This avoids us both losing money to inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I understand you want something closer to the middle, but keep in mind the money loses value faster for me.  I'll take a small hit from my previous offer: $5,600 for me, and $4,400 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
