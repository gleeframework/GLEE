Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I think a 90/10 split is a good starting point, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm not happy with that offer! Even with the inflation, I'm worth more than 4000. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still want a fair share.  Let's see if Bob will take a 60/40 split."
