"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, my gain of 600,000 is now equivalent to 480,000 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of 400,000 is equivalent to 320,000 in the first round's value.

I accept Bob's offer.
