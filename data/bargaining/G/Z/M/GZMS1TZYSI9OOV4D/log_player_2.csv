"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. A fair start, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early in the game to settle for a 40/60 split. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair counter-offer to your previous proposal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise.  I'll take a bit less, but I need a larger share.  How about 54/46? 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. I'm happy to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further rounds of negotiation, as the value of the money may decrease further."
