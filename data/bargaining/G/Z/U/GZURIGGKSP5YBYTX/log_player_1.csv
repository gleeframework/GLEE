I'm going to start by being generous (in theory) and giving Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it. After all, it's better than nothing!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to take less, but I won't accept a deal that leaves me with such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

We're down to the wire. I'm going to take a gamble and lower my offer a bit more, hoping to get Bob to finally accept. The inflation is brutal, and we both risk losing everything if we can't reach an agreement."
