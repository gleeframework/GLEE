"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest.  It's a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, 10% is a pretty steep price to pay for inflation! I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to find a middle ground.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle.
