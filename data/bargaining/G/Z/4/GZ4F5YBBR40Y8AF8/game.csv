500000.0,500000.0,Let's split the money equally. It's fair and avoids any potential conflict.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose we divide the money with a slight imbalance in my favor. This acknowledges the risk involved in proposing the division.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more since I've had to reject two of your offers already.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,I believe a 65/35 split would be fair considering the diminishing value of the money with each passing round. Let's move forward with this.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'm willing to give you a tiny share, but I think I deserve the majority since I've had to reject three of your offers already and the money is worth less and less with each passing round.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Considering the decreasing value of the money, I propose a 70/30 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the impact of inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"I'm willing to give you a tiny share, but I think I deserve the majority since I've had to reject four of your offers already and the money is worth a fraction of what it used to be.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,I think a 75/25 split would be fair given the current situation and the diminishing value of the money. Let's move forward with this proposal.,Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"I'm willing to give you a very small share, but I think I deserve the majority since I've had to reject five of your offers already and the money is almost worthless at this point.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I propose an 80/20 split. This maintains a reasonable balance despite the inflationary pressures.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"I'm willing to give you the smallest possible share, but I think I deserve the majority since I've had to reject six of your offers already and the money is almost worthless at this point.",Bob,12,
