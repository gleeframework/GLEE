"Round 1

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do better than your last offer, Bob. Let's split it closer to 55/45, I'll take the slightly larger share this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end, Bob. Let's compromise a bit more. I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, and we can both get something. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear me down with seemingly ""fair"" offers, but the constant delays heavily favor her. I need to push for a better deal before inflation eats away at the value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and inflation is rapidly diminishing the value of the money. Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a better share. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on her to accept a less favorable deal before time runs out and we both lose."
