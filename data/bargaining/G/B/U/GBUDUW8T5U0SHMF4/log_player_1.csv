# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

**Reasoning:** Bob is stalling and trying to wear me down.  He knows the inflation is hurting me more than him. I need to hold out for a better offer, hoping he'll get nervous as we get closer to the deadline."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still trying to take advantage. He's repeating an offer I already rejected, hoping the pressure will make me cave. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a better deal.  I'll make one more concession, but then I have to play hardball or I risk getting even less."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 51.36% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Don't be hasty! Let's be reasonable. My last offer is still on the table. It's a good deal, and we should take it before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?
model: ```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I need to cut my losses. Bob is clearly unwilling to budge, and accepting this offer is better than getting nothing in the end. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and waiting any longer is too risky."
