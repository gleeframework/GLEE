"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more but you still get a lot. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's best to see what Alice will offer in the next round. Since you get a 10% discount each round, it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly. This way we both get a good amount, and we don't risk losing everything as the rounds go on."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While Alice is offering more, it's still not a fair split.  We are both losing value with each round, so I'm still hoping for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
