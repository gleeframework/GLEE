"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said final, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean getting roughly 60% of the value I could have gotten in round 1. It's a risk, but I think I can still get Alice to agree to a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable.  50/50. This is a fair deal.""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor.  By round 6, the impact of inflation on my end is getting significant. It's time to offer a deal that seems fair on the surface and might be tempting enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 isn't as fair as you think 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to move much further from her 60/40 target. Accepting now gives me the equivalent of about $250,000 in round 1 value. If I push further, I risk getting a worse deal or even nothing at all as we approach the final rounds. It's not ideal, but better to secure something now."
