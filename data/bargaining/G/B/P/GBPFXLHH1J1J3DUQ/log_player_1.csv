"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I want to keep the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to ensure he accepts and we avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. We're already three rounds in, and I want to avoid the risk of losing even more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, inflation is becoming a significant issue.  I'm willing to accept this offer to secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
