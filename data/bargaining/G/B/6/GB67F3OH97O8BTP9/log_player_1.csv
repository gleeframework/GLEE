"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob. I get $5,500, and you get $4,500.  This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Bird Gets the Worm:**  Both Alice and Bob lose value from the money with each passing round. It's in Alice's best interest to settle quickly.
* **Slight Advantage:** The 55/45 split gives Alice a slight edge while still seeming reasonable to Bob. 
* **Clear Communication:** A straightforward message emphasizing fairness and the benefit of a quick resolution can encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair that we both get a bigger share than in your last proposal.  Let's get this done quickly.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor. While he is right that a quick resolution is good due to inflation, this offer is not a fair compromise. It's better to negotiate further, even if it means losing a little value to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to resolve this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Highlight Shared Loss:**  By round 3, the effects of inflation are more pronounced. Emphasizing that both players are losing money can encourage Bob to settle.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and Bob's previous offer suggests he might be trying to take advantage of the situation.
* **Urgency:** The ""fastest way to resolve this"" reinforces the need for a swift decision."
