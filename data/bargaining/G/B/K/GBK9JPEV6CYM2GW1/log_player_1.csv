"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give it away too easily. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 60% share, even if it's a slightly bigger share than my initial offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further or make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my offer needs to take this into account. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Think about it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55% share to myself and 45% to Bob, hoping that this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give up too much more. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting worth less and less, and Bob's offers are getting more reasonable. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50-50 split. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the money being worth even less. Let's end the game here!"
