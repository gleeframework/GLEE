Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share than before, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation but is still trying to hold out for a larger share.  I need to keep the pressure on and hope she gets more realistic soon.  We're getting close to the point where she'll be losing significant value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. This is the best you'll get.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a 50/50 split. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the heat of the diminishing returns.  
* **Shifting Power:** Each round that passes makes my position stronger and hers weaker. 
* **Fairness Factor:** While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is logically sound and might be the push she needs to accept before she loses even more."
