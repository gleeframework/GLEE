"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain more severely, I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

After considering it, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the increased inflation, I'll make a more aggressive proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a more skewed split in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more severely, I'm getting desperate. However, Bob's offer is a relatively fair one, and I'm not sure I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
