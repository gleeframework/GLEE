"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not splitting it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering that the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'd like to try to negotiate further. Bob's offer is a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting 60/40, I'd like to propose a more balanced split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a fair share""
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, considering the inflation.

I'd like to reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I need a bit more, considering the inflation is eating away at our shares""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more of the remaining money, but I'm still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting frustrating! Bob's offer is identical to the one I made in Round 5, and considering the inflation, it's actually a worse deal for me now. I've lost more value due to inflation, so I should get more of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""This is the same offer as before, I need a better deal considering the inflation""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to ravage the value of the money, I need to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more of the remaining money, but I'm still leaving a decent amount for Bob. I hope this offer is more acceptable to him."
