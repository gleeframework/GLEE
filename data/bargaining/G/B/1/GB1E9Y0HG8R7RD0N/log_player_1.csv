"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping a small advantage 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to be careful, as the money is worth less with each passing round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather not give him a 55% share, especially since the money is worth less with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to make up for it. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to split it 50/50, Bob. Let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping he'll accept and we can finally divide the money."
