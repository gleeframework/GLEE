"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly and casual offer to split the money 60/40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more equitable split, considering the potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth 90% of the original $600,000, which is $540,000. And Bob's gain of $550,000 remains the same.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split, considering the original proposal was 60/40. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 90% of $540,000, which is $486,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 48/52, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
