Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

While the offer is less than I was aiming for, accepting now ensures I get something.  The inflation is working against me, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting."
