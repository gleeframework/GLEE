"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted an even split, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in terms of the original $10,000.

With Bob's offer, I would gain $3,000 in the original amount, but due to inflation, the money I gain in the next round is worth 20% less than the original $3,000. So, the effective value of my gain would be $3,000 x 0.8 = $2,400.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll try to get a slightly larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You gave me a bit less last time, so I'll give you a bit less this time. Let's see how you feel about it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me less than I want, I'll give you less than I think you're worth. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in terms of the original $10,000.

With Bob's offer, I would gain $4,000 in the original amount, but due to inflation, the money I gain in the next round is worth 20% less than the original $4,000. So, the effective value of my gain would be $4,000 x 0.8 = $3,200.

However, I need to consider the inflation effect on Bob's gain as well. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his gain is actually worth 51.2% of the original amount. So, Bob's effective gain would be $6,000 x 0.512 = $3,072.

Considering the effective gains, I think I can do better than this. I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll try to get an even larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, so I'll take a bit more. Don't be greedy, let's settle this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking more, I'll take more too. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain in terms of the original $10,000.

With Bob's offer, I would gain $5,000 in the original amount, but due to inflation, the money I gain in the next round is worth 20% less than the original $5,000. So, the effective value of my gain would be $5,000 x 0.8 = $4,000.

However, I notice that Bob's gain is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 32.77% of the original amount. So, Bob's effective gain would be $5,000 x 0.3277 = $1,638.50.

Considering the effective gains, I think I'm getting a better deal with Bob's offer, especially since we're back to an even split. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
