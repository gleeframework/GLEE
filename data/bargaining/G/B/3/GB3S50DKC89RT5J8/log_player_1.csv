"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm keeping the majority of the money, but offering Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round.  I'm hoping this will prevent a long game where inflation could hurt me more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 940000 
# Bob gain: 60000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy here. Inflation is already impacting my potential gains, and I don't want to risk another round where I might get an even worse offer."
