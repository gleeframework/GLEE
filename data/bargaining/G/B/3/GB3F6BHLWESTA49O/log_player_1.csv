Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'll be generous in this first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is just the start of the game.  Bob's offer is tempting, but it's my turn to propose a deal in round 3.  I'm not going to accept anything less than 50% of the money.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'll start with a slightly more even split than my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for the majority. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
