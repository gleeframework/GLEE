"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. My message to Bob is a straightforward one: let's split the money 90-10, a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the new values are:

My gain: $850,000
Bob's gain: $450,000

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
