Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  We'll see if he's willing to settle or wants to try to get a bigger share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not sure how many more rounds Bob will be willing to negotiate. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all due to further inflation."
