"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the original value, so I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

* My gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
* Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
