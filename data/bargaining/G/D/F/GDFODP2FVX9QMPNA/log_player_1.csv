"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get the majority of the money. Given the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the significant inflation. Here's my proposal:

```

This way, I'll get a bit more than before, but still leave Bob with a substantial amount, considering the decreasing value of the money."
