Let's see what a better offer could be!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation rates. We both get a decent share.""

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher. Let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
