Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the circumstances.  The inflation is cutting into your gains significantly, and we need to settle this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000
