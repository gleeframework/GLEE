"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from the full amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI can try to get a better offer in the next rounds. Since the money's value decreases faster for Alice, she may be more willing to compromise in the following rounds to avoid losing more value. Let's see how it goes!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the decreasing value, I think this is fair for both of us.""}\n\nSince the money's value decreases faster for Alice, I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to an equal split but still acknowledges her initial willingness to give me a smaller share. I believe that as the rounds progress, the pressure of the decreasing value, especially on her end, will encourage her to consider offers that might not be as favorable to her as the initial one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a strong offer considering the inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly better than the initial one, considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's share is worth significantly less now, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Alice is under more pressure due to the higher rate of value decrease on her end, so I'll push for a bit more, hoping she'll be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress. The difference in how much value we're losing to inflation could be a strong motivator for her to agree to a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your end, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still believe my share should reflect the increasing value loss you're facing. This is a fair adjustment given the current situation.""}\n\nI'm adjusting my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise but still taking into account the fact that Alice's share is losing value at a much higher rate than mine. This increasing pressure on her side should make her more inclined to accept a deal that is slightly less favorable to her but still reasonable, given the circumstances. The goal is to find a balance where both of us feel the urgency to close the deal due to the inflation but also feel that the division is somewhat equitable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is my final offer in this range.  The clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","Although Alice claims this is her final offer in this range, considering the significant loss of value on her end due to inflation, I believe there's still room for negotiation. The pressure is mounting on both of us, but Alice is losing value at a much higher rate. Rejecting this offer and pushing for a better deal in the next rounds might still yield a more favorable outcome for me. The key is to balance the risk of losing more value against the potential gain of a better split.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial loss of value we're both facing, but especially on your end, I think an equal split is more than fair at this point. It's time for us to meet in the middle and walk away with what's left before it devalues further.""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, especially on Alice's share, I'm proposing an equal split. This offer acknowledges the pressure we're both under due to the decreasing value of the money and suggests a compromise that treats both parties equally. Given the circumstances, this seems like a reasonable and fair proposal that Alice might be inclined to accept, considering the substantial loss she's facing if we continue to negotiate. The risk of further devaluation might prompt her to agree to this split to salvage what she can from the situation."
