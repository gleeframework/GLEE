Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, 60/40 is still quite fair!

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our previous offers, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are getting worse for him with each round due to inflation. He's anchored to the idea of deserving more, but the longer he waits, the less that ""more"" is actually worth. I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out! Take this offer before inflation eats away even more of your potential gains. 60/40 is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. By framing this as my ""final offer"" and highlighting the shrinking value of his share, I'm hoping he'll accept a 60/40 split, even though it favors me more than previous rounds.  He's running out of time to get anything better."
