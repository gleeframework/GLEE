Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's meet in the middle for a fair split 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though it's not an optimal gain for me, with each round the value diminishes significantly. Accepting Alice's offer now secures me a reasonable amount before inflation eats away further at the value."
