Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value with each round, it's time to accept a smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

At this point, the effects of inflation are significant. Rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in the next round is too risky. Accepting a 4000 USD share now is better than risking an even lower offer later."
