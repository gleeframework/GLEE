"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40.""
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want more for myself this time 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer. My current gain of 70 is still worth less than the 60 I initially proposed, so I'm not getting a better deal here.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a great deal, so I'm taking 80. It's a good time to end this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, I proposed a 60-40 split, which was worth 60 for me. Now, considering the inflation, I'd be getting around 30.72 (60 * 0.51, since 100 * 0.51 = 51% of the original value is left).

In this round, Bob's offer of 75 is worth less than what I initially proposed, but it's still a decent offer considering the inflation. I'll decide to accept this offer, as I don't want to risk waiting for an even worse deal.
