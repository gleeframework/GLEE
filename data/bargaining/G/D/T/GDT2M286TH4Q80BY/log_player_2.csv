Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, the total amount is now $90 for me and $80 for Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new values, the total amount is now $90 for me and $64 for Alice.

Since my gain in this offer is 55, which is higher than the 53.4 I would get from the original 40% in round 1 (40 * 0.935), I accept this offer.
