Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split, giving Bob a tiny amount. Since inflation affects me more than him, I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the first round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I've lost 5% of the value of my money due to inflation. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point. It guarantees me a decent sum, and rejecting it could lead to a less favorable offer in the next round."
