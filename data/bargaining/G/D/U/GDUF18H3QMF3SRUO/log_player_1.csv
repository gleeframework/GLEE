"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 900,000 dollars and leaving Bob with 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate will hurt Bob more than me in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially considering the inflation rate will only continue to reduce the value of my share in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. This still gives me a significant portion of the money, and it reflects the inflation rate that is impacting Bob more than me."
