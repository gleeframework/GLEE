,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I understand your concerns about inflation, but I think 60/40 is unfair. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about 58/42?  This accounts for the faster devaluation of my share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I see we're getting closer, but I still think your offer is a bit skewed. Considering the inflation, I'll offer 52/48. Let's settle this before the money loses more value!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the money's losing value fast. I'll come down a bit further to 56/44. This is a fair deal considering the inflation we're both facing.",Alice,5,
