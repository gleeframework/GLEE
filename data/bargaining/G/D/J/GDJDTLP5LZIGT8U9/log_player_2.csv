"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, let's close the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the value of waiting any longer is heavily outweighed by the inflation. While not ideal, taking the $350,000 is the best option for Bob to at least walk away with something."
