Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth. I propose an even 50/50 split.  It's fair and avoids further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
