"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

Since I'll be getting 20% of the total amount ($2,000), which is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
