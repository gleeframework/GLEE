Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see how Bob reacts!  I figure he'll probably want to negotiate, but I'm hoping he'll accept just to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed I didn't get to keep most of the money, I'm not sure how much inflation will impact me in future rounds.  Taking 500,000 now is better than risking a worse offer later."
