"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so the actual amount I'd get is $9,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. This is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise.

I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
