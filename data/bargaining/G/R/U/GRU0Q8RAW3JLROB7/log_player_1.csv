"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, that means I'll get $44 (50 - 10% of 50).

Bob's offer is to give me $40, which is less than what I would have gotten in the first round. However, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I think $40 is a decent offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer for now.
