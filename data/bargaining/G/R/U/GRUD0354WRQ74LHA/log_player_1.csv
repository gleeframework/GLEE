"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still 80% of the original amount, I think I should take it.
