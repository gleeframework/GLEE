"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering I'm taking on more risk with the inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a more balanced split, given the inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```
Reason:While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of her share.  I'm willing to gamble on one more round to try and secure a better deal.
