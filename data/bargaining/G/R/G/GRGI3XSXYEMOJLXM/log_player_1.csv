"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 99.9% / 0.1% split, keeping most of the money for myself.  I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept this offer early on, as the inflation risk may be higher for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is an incredibly risky move by Bob. I won't accept this offer.  Even though I get a smaller share, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds. The risk of inflation is high, and I need to maximize my gains.  The 1000$ I'm offered is not worth the potential loss if I end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 99% for me and 1% for Bob.  I want to try to find a balance between incentivizing Bob to accept while still securing the majority of the money. The inflation risk is still high, and I need to be careful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I can't accept. The inflation rate is getting very high for Bob, and he's likely to be feeling pressured. However, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself. I'm aware that the longer we go, the higher the risk of getting nothing, but I'm confident in my ability to secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 980000, ""bob_gain"": 20000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to 98% for me and 2% for Bob.  I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob is incentivized to accept, but I'm still getting the majority of the money. Inflation is a major factor, and I need to secure a good deal before it gets too risky."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject. Bob's offer is getting more tempting, but I'm not going to give in just yet. The inflation rate is hitting him hard, but I believe I can still get a larger share. I have to remember that the longer this goes on, the riskier it becomes for both of us.  I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 970000, ""bob_gain"": 30000}
```

I'm increasing my offer once again, this time to 97% for me and 3% for Bob. The inflation is clearly taking its toll on Bob, but I need to balance that with the risk of getting nothing. We're getting close to the end, and I want to secure a reasonable share before the potential for both of us to get nothing becomes too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30000 
# Bob gain: 970000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject. While the offer is becoming increasingly appealing due to the inflation, I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal for me. I'm aware we're running out of time, but I'm not ready to give up on a larger share just yet. The risk of getting nothing is very real, but I'm going to push for a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 95% for me and 5% for Bob.  We're running out of time, and I need to make sure we can come to an agreement before the inflation risk becomes too high. I'm still aiming for a good share, but I'm also acknowledging the need for a compromise."
