I propose Alice gets $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving me a significant share while leaving something for Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that my share is worth 5% less than in the previous round due to inflation.  I'm not going to settle for a much smaller share this early in the game. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick with my original strategy of aiming for a large share while still leaving something for Bob.  Given the inflation, I'll reduce my share by $1000 but still offer him a decent amount. I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is starting to look more appealing.  Even with the inflation, my share is still considerable, and Bob's is also significant.  It's better to take this offer than risk further inflation and end up with nothing."
