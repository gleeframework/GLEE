"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust later if you're not happy with this deal. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a very unfair offer. While I could accept and get a small amount, there's a good chance I can get more if I reject and let Alice make the next offer. Inflation will start to hurt Alice's potential gains, and she might be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a 40% share, which is a fair starting point considering the inflation that will affect our future offers.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 40% is too low. Let's split it 55/45. This gives us both a decent share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option considering the inflation. It's a significant improvement from Alice's previous offer, and further rounds might not result in a better deal for me."
