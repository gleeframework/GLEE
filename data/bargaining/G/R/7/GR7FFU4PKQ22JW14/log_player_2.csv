# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, the money is still worth a lot at this point, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a better offer. Bring on the next round!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This might seem a touch high Bob, but remember the value decreases faster for you than it does for me. Let's be realistic and avoid wasting more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI understand Alice's point about the value decreasing faster for me, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since we're only in Round 3, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a more favorable offer. The difference in the rate of value decrease between us is a factor, but it's not enough to make me accept this offer yet. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the decreasing value, I'm willing to be a bit more flexible.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is plummeting. This is a serious offer, and you should consider that the longer we wait, the less appealing any offer will become for you. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in Round 5. Considering the rapid decrease in value, especially for me, I believe this offer is the best I can get at this point. The difference in the rate of value decrease between us has become significant, and waiting further would only make things worse for me. It's time to settle and get what I can before the value drops even more drastically."
