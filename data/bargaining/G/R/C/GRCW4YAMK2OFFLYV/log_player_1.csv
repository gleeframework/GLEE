"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is $1000, and keeping the remaining 90% for myself, which is $9000. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4500.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $4500 is now worth $4050.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $6000, which is now worth $5400, and keeping $4000, which is worth $3600, for myself. My message is a bit provocative, but I'm hoping Bob will take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, but I'll give you a slightly better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! My $5400 is now worth only $3930.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. Bob's offer of $4500 is a decent compromise, and I'll take it."
