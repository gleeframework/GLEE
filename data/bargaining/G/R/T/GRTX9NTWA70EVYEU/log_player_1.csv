Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about a 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to account for the inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
