Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my valuation of the offer. In round 1, 40 was worth 100% and 60 was worth 100%. Now, 50 is worth 64% of what it was in round 1 (since 36% less is 64% of the original value). 

In round 1, 40 was 40% of the total, and 60 was 60% of the total. Now, 50 is 50% of the total, which is worth 64% of the original 40, which is 25.6. 

So, the offer is not as good as my original offer in round 2, which was 80, worth 80% of the original 100, which is 80.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 72% of its original value (64% * 1.125, because 20% inflation in round 2 and 20% inflation in round 3), I should adjust my offer accordingly.

Considering the money is now worth 72% of its original value, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation. I'll offer 90, which is worth 90 * 0.72 = 64.8, and leave 15.2 for Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 59.04% of its original value (100% - 40.96% = 59.04%), I need to adjust my valuation of the offer.

In the first round, 40 was 40% of the total, and 60 was 60% of the total. Now, 60 is worth 59.04% of the original 60, which is 35.224.

Since Alice's offer is 40, which is worth 100% of its original value, it's equivalent to 40/100 * 100 = 40.

Considering the offer, I'm getting 35.224 and Alice is getting 40. Since I'm getting less than 40, and I'm trying to maximize my gain, I should reject this offer.
