"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though Alice's offer is tempting in the first round, it's important to remember that you have 12 rounds to negotiate and that the money will lose value with each passing round. It's worth trying to get a larger share of the money, even if it means taking a risk and rejecting this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than the previous one, it's still only a 3000$ gain for me, and the money is worth 36% less now.  I'm still hoping for a better deal, especially considering I have 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Alice's offer is better than the previous one, it's still only a 4000$ gain for me, and the money is worth 59.04% less now.  I'm still hoping for a better deal, especially considering I have 7 more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a turning point.  While the money is worth significantly less now (73.79% less), getting 5000$ is better than risking getting nothing at all.  I only have 5 rounds left, and the odds of negotiating a better deal are slim."
