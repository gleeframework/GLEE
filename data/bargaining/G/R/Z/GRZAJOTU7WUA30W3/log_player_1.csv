Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share, but I'm willing to split it 90/10.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fair split.  We both get a significant amount, and it's more equitable than your previous offer.  Let's end this now and avoid any further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
