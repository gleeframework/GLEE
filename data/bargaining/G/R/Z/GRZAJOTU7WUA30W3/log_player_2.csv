Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share, but I'm willing to split it 90/10.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's not fair to me and there's no reason to think Alice will be more generous in the next round.  I'll make a counter-offer."
