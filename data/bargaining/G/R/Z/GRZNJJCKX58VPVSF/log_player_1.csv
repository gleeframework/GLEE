"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'd like to aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is still a decent compromise.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and I need to adjust my strategy.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bit more too. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming for a 45/55 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gain!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 35/65 split, especially since the money is worth even less than before. I'm starting to feel the pressure to get a better deal.

However, I don't want to reject another offer without trying to negotiate further. I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain!

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bit more too. Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42/58 split, trying to account for the ongoing inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
