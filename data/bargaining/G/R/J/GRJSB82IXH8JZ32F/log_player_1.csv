"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, I'll give you a chance to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly. My message is a friendly one, inviting him to negotiate, but also making it clear that I'm not willing to give up much at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50-50! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 50% of the remaining money. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
