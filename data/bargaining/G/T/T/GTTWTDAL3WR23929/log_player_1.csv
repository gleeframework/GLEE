"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but now it's even more skewed towards him.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll accept it."
