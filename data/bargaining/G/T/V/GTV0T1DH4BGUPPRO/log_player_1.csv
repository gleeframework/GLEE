"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority this time""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, keeping 60 dollars for myself and giving Bob 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm actually trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer, and hopefully we can reach an agreement. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is 45-55, I'm not thrilled about giving up more money. However, I do appreciate the fact that Bob is trying to find a more balanced split. Considering the inflation effect, the 10% decrease in Bob's gain makes the offer slightly more appealing.

I'll decide to...
