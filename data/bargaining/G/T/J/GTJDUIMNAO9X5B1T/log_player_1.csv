"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start with a fair-ish offer to see how Bob feels about it. I'm hoping he'll accept, but we'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and there's still a lot of rounds left. I'm not ready to settle for that yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll reduce my offer slightly to see if Bob is willing to compromise. I think this is a fair offer, considering his offer was worse than my initial one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still worse than my initial one, inflation is starting to bite into his side of the deal.  I'm not sure I can get a better offer, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
