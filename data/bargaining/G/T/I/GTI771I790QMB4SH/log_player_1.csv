I'm offering a 5500/4500 split. This should be a fair starting point, as it gives me slightly more but leaves Bob with a decent share as well.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a fair split, and with inflation biting into both of our gains, I'd rather not risk losing more money in another round."
