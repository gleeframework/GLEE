**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting better, but they're still tilted in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her more than it's hurting me. It's time to play hardball and see if I can get a better deal before time runs out."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a very fair split considering the circumstances. Take it and we both win, or leave it and we both get nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting into the late stages of the game, and Alice needs to understand the gravity of the situation. By presenting this as my ""final offer"" with a firm tone, I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious about not accepting anything less than a near-even split.  The slight edge in my favor acknowledges the inflation disadvantage Alice faces, but not to a degree that would be unreasonable for her to accept at this point."
