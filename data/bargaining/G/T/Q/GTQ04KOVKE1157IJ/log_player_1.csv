"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share for my negotiating skills. How about we split it 50/50? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
