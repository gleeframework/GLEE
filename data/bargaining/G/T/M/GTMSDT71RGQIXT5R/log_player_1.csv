Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk in round 1. How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and we're both losing out.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to accept the offer now, as the money is losing value with each round for Bob. There is a chance that he might reject my offer, in which case I'll be left with nothing in the next round!"
