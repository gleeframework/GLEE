"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I'm taking on the risk of the money losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob than for me. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since I'm not losing value as much. How about 55/45?""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting a slightly larger share since the money is worth more to me due to inflation."
