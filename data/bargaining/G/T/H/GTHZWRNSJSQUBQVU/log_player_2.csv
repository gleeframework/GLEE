Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take more due to inflation costs 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly greedy, but time is also working against her.  It's risky, but holding out for a better offer in the next couple of rounds is still the best strategy. We need to apply more pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the value diminishes with each round. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  The ""final offer"" tactic can push Alice to accept, especially as she's feeling the pressure of inflation. 
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering her slightly more than the initial round is a show of good faith that might encourage her to agree without further negotiation.
* **Risk Assessment:** We're getting into the later rounds, and waiting longer for a slightly better deal might backfire if Alice becomes too inflexible."
