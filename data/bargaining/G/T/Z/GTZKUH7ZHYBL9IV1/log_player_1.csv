Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I've had enough of negotiating and trying to squeeze out a better deal. With my gains worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm not sure I can do any better. The 40-60 split is still a bit unfair, but I think it's time to accept a deal and move on. I'll take the 40 and call it a day."
