"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 95% of the initial value, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
