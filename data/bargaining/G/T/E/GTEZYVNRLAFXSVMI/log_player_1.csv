"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I get $6000 and Bob gets $4000, along with a message suggesting that a 60-40 split is a fair deal. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. If Bob rejects, he will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the bigger share since I'm making the offer this round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I will reject Bob's offer since I don't agree that he should get the bigger share just because he's making the offer this round. I made a similar offer in the previous round, and he rejected it, so I'll reject his offer as well.


{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again to make an offer in Round 3. I will propose a division where I get $5500 and Bob gets $4500, with a message suggesting that we meet in the middle.
