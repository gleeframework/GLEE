"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the faster rate of inflation against my share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation rates. Let's work together to find a solution we both agree on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness. How about a 58/42 split? It's closer to your offer but still accounts for the faster devaluation of my share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
