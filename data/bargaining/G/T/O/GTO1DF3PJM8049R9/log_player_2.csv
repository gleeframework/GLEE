# Alice gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While time is ticking, Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly.  I'm betting she'll become more willing to accept a less favorable deal soon to avoid getting nothing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a risk by not taking your 'final offer', but I think we can still find a better compromise. The inflation is really hurting me now 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly desperate. This offer is better than my last offer and the inflation is going to keep hurting both of us. Better to take a decent deal now than risk getting nothing."
