"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm inclined to accept it. The 3000 I'll get is still a decent amount, and it's better than nothing. Plus, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
