"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant sum, Bob. Let's not lose value to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is becoming a factor, but her offer still heavily favors her.  I need to show her I'm willing to push this further to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise to get us both a decent amount before inflation hurts us too much.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer ensures we both benefit. Don't let greed cost us everything. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation:**  We are five rounds in. The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each passing round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to hold out for a better offer carries a huge risk. The longer this goes on, the less we both stand to gain, even if I get a slightly better split later.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has consistently aimed for a 60/40 split in her favor. Her offer is unlikely to drastically improve in the remaining rounds. 

It's frustrating to accept a less-than-ideal deal, but the risk of walking away with nothing is too great at this point."
