I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to decrease my offer slightly to see if Bob is willing to compromise. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure a deal before it gets too much worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting serious, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer. Even with the significant inflation, I'm better off taking this than risking getting nothing at all."
