"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount.  I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round, as both of us will lose money if we keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better for me than my previous offer, it's still not a good deal.  Since the money is worth less each round, I'm better off rejecting and seeing if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly from the previous round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. Since he lost 10% of the value of his potential gain in round 2, this offer should be more attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though inflation has hit hard, Bob's offer is better than what I can realistically expect at this point.  The money is worth significantly less for both of us, and I don't think I can get a better deal.  It's time to take what I can get and end this game."
