"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive offer in the first round, hoping to secure a large share while taking advantage of the potential for inflation to impact Bob more negatively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd ideally get more, this offer is still a decent gain, and with the uncertainty of inflation, it's risky to continue rejecting offers.  It's better to secure a significant portion of the money now."
