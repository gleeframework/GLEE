"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but I value my contribution too. This offer is more balanced considering the future rounds.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. While I want to reach an agreement, accepting such an offer would set a bad precedent for future negotiations. 
* **Time Value:**  By rejecting her offer, I signal that I'm willing to risk the money devaluing to get a fairer deal. My offer is slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable for Alice to consider given the time pressure.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts the ball in Alice's court. If she's truly reasonable, she'll understand that accepting now is better than risking a lower offer in a later round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money is losing value quickly. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer significantly risks getting an even lower amount in future rounds.
* **Concession:** Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, even if slightly in her favor. This indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a marginally better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk, especially if Alice becomes more assertive in her demands as the deadline looms."
