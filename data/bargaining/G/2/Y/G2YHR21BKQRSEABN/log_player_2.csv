"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept a deal that gives me less than half the money, especially with inflation being a factor. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can find a fair solution that works for both of us. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share since I'm taking on more risk with the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58/42, it's the best I can offer considering the inflation is affecting me more. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hit hard. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and I'm not confident Alice will offer anything better in the future."
