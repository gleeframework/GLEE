"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% of the initial amount, leaving you with 10%.""
}
```

I'm starting with a bold move, offering Bob a relatively small share. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
