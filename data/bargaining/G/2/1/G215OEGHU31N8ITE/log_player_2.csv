Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90 and you can have 10. We can talk about more even splits later.

With inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling the pinch of that inflation, Bob.  Let's try 70-30 this time.  We can work towards a more balanced split later on. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share, but I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more even split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
