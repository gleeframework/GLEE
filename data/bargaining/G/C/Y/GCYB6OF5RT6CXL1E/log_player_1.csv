"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer gives Bob a tiny amount of money while giving Alice the vast majority. This is a strategy to try and get Bob to accept quickly, as he has little to gain from rejecting and moving to the next round. Remember, the money will be worth less for Alice with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice could try to negotiate further, the risk of inflation and receiving a worse deal in the next round makes this 50/50 split the best option."
