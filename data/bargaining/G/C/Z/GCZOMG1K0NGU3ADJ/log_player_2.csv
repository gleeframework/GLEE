"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split to get the ball rolling? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can do better.  I'm not sure a 60/40 split is fair right now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair start, considering the value of the money decreases each round for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with a 55/45 split. It's important we strike a deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's get this done. 55/45 is a reasonable compromise."
