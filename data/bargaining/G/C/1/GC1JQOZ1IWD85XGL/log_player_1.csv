"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. The message is a friendly and neutral proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split offer, but I'm not sure I'll be so generous later on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $60 is now worth $48 (80% of $60).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with reduced value.

```
