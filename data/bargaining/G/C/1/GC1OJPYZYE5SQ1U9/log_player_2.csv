"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for us both to secure a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. This offer considers the time pressure we both face.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer still gives you a sizable share, and it accounts for the increasing impact of inflation on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob, and her offers are reflecting that. While her offer isn't terrible, it's still skewed in her favor.  Bob has time to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation pressure is on you, but my offer is more than fair. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, but I want to reach a deal. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. While not ideal, this offer is closer to a fair split considering the rapid inflation affecting Alice's share.  It's risky to wait any longer as Alice's offers might get even worse from Bob's perspective. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
