}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can have 40% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation. In this round, I'll have to consider that my gain of 4000 is actually worth 90% of the original 5000 I was offered in the first round.

I'll think for a moment...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a better share.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took the lead last time, now it's my turn to try to get a better deal""
}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You want a better deal, I'll give you 45% 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to counter my previous offer. Since the money is worth less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

In this round, my gain of 4500 is worth 36.9% of the original 5000 I was offered in the first round, and Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 55% of the original 5000.
