"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent cut. Accept this, and we both get something.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that offer was too unbalanced. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle. 60/40 in my favor seems fair considering your initial proposal.  Accept this and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation.  She knows the value is decreasing and wants to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal. I need to hold firm for a better outcome, even if it means risking a worse offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice, and we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing a compromise: 55/45 in my favor. It's closer to the middle ground and ensures we both benefit significantly.  Let's be smart and seal the deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but holding firm on getting a larger share.  The message emphasizes the time pressure and frames the offer as a win-win, encouraging Alice to accept before the value drops further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both playing a dangerous game here. This is the closest we'll get to a fair split.  Take it or we both lose more with every passing round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but time pressure is becoming a significant factor. Alice has mirrored my previous offer, and while it's not ideal, it's better to secure something than risk ending up with nothing.  The longer this drags on, the less we both gain.  It's time to cut my losses and accept the compromise."
