Alice's offer is getting ridiculous. I'm not accepting such a terrible deal, especially with the inflation affecting me significantly less than her. I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Alice's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation is hitting her much harder than me. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I'm taking a big gamble here. Alice's offers are becoming absurd, and the inflation is hitting her much harder than me. I'm offering her a small amount, hoping the desperation of the situation will convince her to accept."
