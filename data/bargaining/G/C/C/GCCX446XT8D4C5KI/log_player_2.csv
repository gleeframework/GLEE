Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway between our last offers 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split.  With inflation eating away at the value, it's worth holding out for a better deal a little longer.  There's still a risk, but accepting now sets a bad precedent and Alice may not budge much."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. 50/50 is the fairest and we both lose if this fails.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Sticking to a firm 50/50 split is important to establish Bob is serious about a fair deal.  While a compromise *might* net slightly more, there's a growing risk Alice won't budge and they'll both end up with nothing. This round emphasizes the time pressure."
