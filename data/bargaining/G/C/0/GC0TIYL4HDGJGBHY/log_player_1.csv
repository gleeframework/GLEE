# Alice gain: 4000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This seems like a reasonable compromise, Bob.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is coming, let's settle at 58-42! 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's important to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Accepting Bob's offer of $4200 is better than risking another round where we'd likely get even less. It's a compromise to avoid further losses from inflation."
