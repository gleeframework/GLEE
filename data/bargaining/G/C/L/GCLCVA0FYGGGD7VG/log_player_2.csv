Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. I think this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are really hurting Bob.  Let's analyze why accepting is the best option:

* **Round 5 Offer:** Bob gets $4500 (worth only ~$3000 in Round 1 value)
* **Round 6 Potential:**  Even if Bob could get a slightly better deal in Round 6, the inflation means his gains will be worth significantly less. He'd need to secure a much larger portion of the money to make up for the 34.39% (and growing) devaluation.

Alice knows time is on her side. Bob is better off accepting a less-than-ideal offer now than risking an even worse outcome as inflation eats away at his potential gains."
