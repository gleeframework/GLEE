Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  We're both losing money with every round.  This is better than what you'll get in a few more rounds, I guarantee it. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and our potential gains are dwindling. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. Take it while you still can! 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer. Accepting this offer would mean losing almost two thirds of the potential value from round 1.  While the pressure is on, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a compromise that still gives you the bigger share. Let's end this before we lose even more to inflation.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a significant concession to avoid disaster. Offering 45/55 shows I'm willing to compromise but still positions me better than Alice's last offer. The message emphasizes the urgency and frames the offer as a favorable solution for both of us."
