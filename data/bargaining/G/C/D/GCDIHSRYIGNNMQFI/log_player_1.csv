"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure an agreement in the first round.  I'm aiming for 90% of the money for myself, which is a significant amount, but I'm willing to share a bit to avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my share in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation factor is a major concern. In round 1, I was aiming for 900,000, but due to inflation, that amount is now worth 720,000. Accepting Bob's offer ensures that I at least get half of the original amount, and I'm not willing to risk further inflation."
