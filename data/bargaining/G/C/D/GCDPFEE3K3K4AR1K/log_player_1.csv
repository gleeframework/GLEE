"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll try to get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $5,500, while keeping Bob's share at $4,500. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable compromise."

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. With the new values, I'm considering Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation has reduced the value of the money, but I'm not willing to settle for a 52-48 split just yet. I'd like to propose another offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value now. Here's my new offer:

}
```

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get left with scraps 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value now. With the new values, I'm considering Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, but I'm not willing to settle for a 54-46 split. I'd like to propose another offer, but I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going back to the original proposal, but with a slight tweak. Let's meet in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me.""
}
```

I'm reverting to a 60-40 split, but with a slight adjustment to account for the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation has reduced the value of the money so significantly that I don't think I can get a better deal. $5,200 is a reasonable amount, and I'm willing to settle for it. I'd rather take what I can get now and avoid risking getting nothing at the end of the 12 rounds."
