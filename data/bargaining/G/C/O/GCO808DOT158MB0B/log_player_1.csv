"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more. Give me a chance to prove it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not impressed, Bob. You think you can just take advantage of inflation to get more? I'm not afraid to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending the message to let him know that I'm not afraid to stand my ground."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting away with a free lunch!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough. I'm starting to think you're just trying to lowball me! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit frustrated! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think I'm lowballing you? You're the one who's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more than your fair share! I'm not afraid to stand firm.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, and calling out his attempt to take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but don't think you're getting a free pass just because of inflation. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer, so let's see if he'll accept it!"
