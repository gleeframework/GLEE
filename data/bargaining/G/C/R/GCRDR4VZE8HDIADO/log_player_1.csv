"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair starting point""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split.  It's more equitable, and it gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $405,000. And Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $440,000.

I'm not sure I like this offer. I think I can do better. I'd like to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too generous, I'd like to propose a 60:40 split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. My gain of $450,000 in the previous round is now worth 90% of that, which is $405,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth 80% of that, which is $440,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A 60:40 split is fair, considering the inflation""
}
```"
