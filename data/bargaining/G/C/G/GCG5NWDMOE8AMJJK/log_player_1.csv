"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both want a good share. Let's be reasonable and end this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the offer is not as favorable as my initial proposal, the inflation is a significant factor.  My potential gain is now 20% lower, making it more appealing to accept a less favorable offer.
* **Fairness:**  While the 60/40 split is not exactly equal, it's closer than my initial offer, and the message suggests a desire to end the game.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to the next round would mean another potential 20% reduction in my potential earnings. It's not worth the risk for a slightly better chance at a more favorable outcome."
