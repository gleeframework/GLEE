"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000, the rest is mine.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Splitting it evenly is a fair approach, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}
```

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
