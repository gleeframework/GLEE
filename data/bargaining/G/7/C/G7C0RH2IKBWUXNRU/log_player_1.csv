"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for future inflation.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 55/45 split is indeed a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 55/45 split, how about 52/48?""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being open to negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52/48 is a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000 and keeping $520,000 for myself, and reiterating my message from the previous round."
