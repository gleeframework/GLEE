Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but ultimately unfair given the time pressure on me. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share now to avoid further devaluation of the money. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
