Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55-45. It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. I think I can do better than a 45-55 split.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50-50. It's a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a compromise between my initial 60-40 offer and Bob's 45-55 offer. I hope Bob will consider this a fair and reasonable proposal."
