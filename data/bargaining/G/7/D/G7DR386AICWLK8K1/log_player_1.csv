"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. This way, I get $6,000, and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a bit more than this.  Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

However, I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a better offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 64% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 90.25% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still a bit more than the previous offer."
