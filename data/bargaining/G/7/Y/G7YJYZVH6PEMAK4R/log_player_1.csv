"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40. Is this acceptable to you?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of the original $1,000,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'll consider it. I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a smaller share now against the risk of waiting for a better offer in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This split is a bit more in your favor, but I think it's still fair.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation:

My gain of $300,000 is worth 30% of the original $600,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 70% of the original $1,000,000.

I'm not happy about the 70-30 split, but I'll consider it. I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a smaller share now against the risk of waiting for a better offer in future rounds.
