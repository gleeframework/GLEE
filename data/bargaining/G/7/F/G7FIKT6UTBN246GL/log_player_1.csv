# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, where I'll take 400,000 and Bob will take 600,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that gives Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeps me with a significant portion of the money."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

I'm really unhappy with the tiny consolation prize I'm being offered. I was hoping for a better deal after rejecting the previous offers. With the money being worth less and less, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I'll take 300,000 and Bob will take 700,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that gives Bob a bigger share, but still keeps me with a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle."
