{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be reasonable, I'm offering you 40 which is still a good deal before inflation eats away at the value for me.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn now, and the value is slipping away for you! I'm offering you 30.  It's better than waiting for less. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
