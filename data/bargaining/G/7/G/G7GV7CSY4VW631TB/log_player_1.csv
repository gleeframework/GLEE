"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. I propose a 60/40 split. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my potential gain of $8,000 is now worth $6,400. Bob's offer is still more generous than that, so I'll consider it.

I accept Bob's offer.
