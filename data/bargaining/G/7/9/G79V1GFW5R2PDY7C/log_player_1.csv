# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Although the inflation is taking its toll, I still believe I can negotiate a more favorable deal.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think this is a fair deal at this point. With the value of my gain already decreased by 40.95% and Bob's gain decreased by 22.62%, it's time to close the deal before we both lose even more value. A 50/50 split seems like the best option to stop the loss of value and walk away with something reasonable. Let's end the game here!"
