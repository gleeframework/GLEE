"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think meeting in the middle is a good idea, especially since the money is losing value. I'd like to make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on more risk 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the accelerated inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. Since the money is worth significantly less, I'll aim for a higher share to make up for it. However, I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best option at this point.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the accelerated inflation, I'll need to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next move:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""It's getting tough to make ends meet, so I'll take a more aggressive stance to ensure I get a decent share.""
}
```"
