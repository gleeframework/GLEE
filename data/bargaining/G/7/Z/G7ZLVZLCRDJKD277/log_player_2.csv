"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling a bit greedy.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can finally move on to more important matters. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this negotiation drags on, the more Alice loses due to the higher inflation rate she faces. It's in my best interest to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing valuable time and money here.  My final offer is a 52.5/47.5 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's wrap this up.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round costs both of us money due to inflation, but Alice loses a much larger percentage.  Putting a time limit on the negotiation adds pressure.
* **Slight Advantage:** This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a reasonable split that Alice might accept rather than risk further losses.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling I'm unwilling to negotiate further, which can sometimes push for a quicker resolution."
