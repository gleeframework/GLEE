"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the $1,000,000 and leave 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll take the offer that gives me a higher amount, even though it's less than my initial offer.
