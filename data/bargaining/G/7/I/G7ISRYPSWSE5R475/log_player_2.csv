"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not satisfied with a 10/90 split.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fairer split considering I'm taking the risk of proposing first this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a 70/30 split,  knowing you're feeling the pressure of inflation.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, with the inflation pressure, accepting a 30/70 split is a reasonable move. It's better than getting nothing in the end."
