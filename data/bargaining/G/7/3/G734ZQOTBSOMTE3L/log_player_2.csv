"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can try to negotiate for a better deal without any penalty. Given that Alice's offer is an even split, I'll reject it to see if I can get a better proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let me know what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice loses 10% of the value each round, and I don't, I'll try to take advantage of this by offering her a slightly worse deal than the initial 50-50 split. This way, I'll gain more, but Alice might still accept due to the decreasing value for her.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, I think this is fair.""}"
