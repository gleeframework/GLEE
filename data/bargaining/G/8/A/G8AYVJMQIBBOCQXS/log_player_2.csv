"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know the money will be worth less to me in future rounds. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while still being fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This offer is getting closer to what I want, and the inflation is starting to hit hard. I'd rather take this deal than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
