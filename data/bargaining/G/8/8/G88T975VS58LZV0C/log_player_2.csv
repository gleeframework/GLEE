"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems generous, it's incredibly unbalanced. I'll reject and see what she proposes next, knowing the money will be worth less for her in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering you a decent share, but time is running out, so accept before the money loses its value for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference and avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is much more reasonable now, and the money she gets is worth less due to inflation.  While I'd prefer to get more,  it's a fair split and the risk of losing even more money by rejecting is too high."
