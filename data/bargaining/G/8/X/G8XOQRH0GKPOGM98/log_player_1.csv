I'm going to be greedy in the first round. I'll take the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with a tiny amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it out of desperation, since he might think that getting anything is better than nothing. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being extremely greedy! I'm not going to accept that offer.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose an even split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement quickly. If we keep rejecting each other's proposals, we risk running out of time and getting nothing."
