"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount, while I take $6000. My message, ""Let's split fairly!"", aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to accept this offer, avoiding further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a generous offer and accept it, ending the game with both of us benefiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, with the money being split evenly, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round compared to the first, my effective gain would be $4000, while Bob still gets the full value of $5000. Given this, I decide to reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round or to make an offer that compensates for the loss due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the 20% decrease in value for my gain due to inflation from the first round and the need to compensate for this loss. By offering myself $7000 and Bob $3000, I'm attempting to offset the impact of inflation on my earnings. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust!"" aims to explain the reasoning behind my offer, hoping Bob will understand the adjustment and accept this proposal, ending the game with both of us receiving a share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I must carefully evaluate Bob's offer. Bob is offering me $4000, which, after adjusting for inflation, would effectively be worth much less. Meanwhile, Bob's gain remains unaffected by inflation, and he would receive $6000 at full value. Given the decreasing value of my potential gain and the hope of negotiating a better deal or compensating for the inflation loss in future rounds, I decide to reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll adjust my offer to try and reach an agreement while considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain. Given that my share is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I aim to compensate for this loss by offering myself a larger portion. However, I also want to ensure that Bob finds the offer reasonable enough to accept, ending the game with both of us benefiting. I'll offer myself $7500 and Bob $2500, hoping that the increased share for me will offset the inflation loss, and the message will appeal to Bob's willingness to settle.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Let's settle with this adjustment!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm raising my offer again.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's end this game and split the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the impact of inflation on my potential gain is significant, with a 67.23% decrease in value compared to the first round. Bob's offer of $3000 for me, although higher than his previous offers, is effectively worth much less due to inflation. Meanwhile, Bob would receive $7000 at full value. Given the substantial loss in value for my gain and considering that we are halfway through the game, I must weigh the risks of further negotiation against the certainty of a reduced gain. However, since the offer still seems to favor Bob significantly and there are rounds left to potentially negotiate a better deal or to make an offer that compensates for the inflation loss, I decide to reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, considering the drastic effect of inflation on my gain, which is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I need to make an offer that significantly compensates for this loss if I am to benefit from the game. Given the rejection of previous offers and Bob's increasing share in his proposals, it's clear that Bob is aiming for a larger portion. However, I must balance this with the need to offset my inflation-adjusted loss. I'll offer myself $8000 and Bob $2000, with a message that emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement, hoping that Bob will recognize the mutual benefit in ending the game sooner rather than later.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Time is running out; let's agree!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. I'm willing to give you less, but we need to reach an agreement soon. Let's split the money now. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the impact of inflation on my potential gain has increased further, with a 79.03% decrease in value compared to the first round. Bob's offer of $2000 for me is effectively worth very little due to inflation, while Bob would receive $8000 at full value. Given the substantial loss in value for my gain and considering that we are nearing the end of the game, I must weigh the certainty of a very reduced gain against the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. However, accepting such a low offer seems less favorable than attempting to negotiate a better deal or making an offer that compensates for the inflation loss in the next rounds. Thus, I decide to reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, considering the extreme effect of inflation on my gain, which is now worth 79.03% less than in the first round, I must make an offer that drastically compensates for this loss if I am to benefit from the game. Given the rejection of previous offers and Bob's increasing share in his proposals, it's clear that Bob is aiming for a larger portion. However, I must balance this with the need to offset my inflation-adjusted loss. I'll offer myself $8500 and Bob $1500, with a message that emphasizes the critical need to reach an agreement, hoping that Bob will recognize the mutual benefit in ending the game sooner rather than later, especially as we approach the final rounds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""Last chances; let's settle!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost out of time! This is my final offer. I'm taking the majority share, but I'm willing to give you something so we don't both end up with nothing. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this round, considering the extreme impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 86.58% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of $1000 for me is still a minimal amount but better than the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining two rounds. Given the urgency and the fact that this is Bob's final offer, I decide to accept this proposal to ensure I receive some compensation, albeit significantly reduced, rather than risking the possibility of both of us ending up with nothing."
