"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get $80 and Bob gets $20. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair split, considering the division should be roughly equal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'll take a little less, but we'll both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not getting as much as I wanted, but it's a better deal than the first round. I'll accept this offer.
