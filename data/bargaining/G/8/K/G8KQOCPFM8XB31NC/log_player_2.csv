Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe this offer is fairer. It ensures a more balanced outcome, especially considering the inflation affecting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It reflects the time pressure and the fact that we both lose if this goes on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair compromise. We both receive half of the remaining money.  Let's end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Bob with each round. 
* **Alice's Offer:** A 50/50 split is the fairest offer Bob is likely to get, especially considering the time pressure.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. In fact, she's likely to offer less favorable terms knowing the pressure is on Bob.

Waiting longer will likely result in Bob getting a smaller portion of a shrinking pie.
