"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small portion, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I need to consider the adjusted values.

If we split it evenly, I'll get $50, which is 50% of the original $100, but considering the 5% inflation, it's equivalent to 47.5% of the original amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
