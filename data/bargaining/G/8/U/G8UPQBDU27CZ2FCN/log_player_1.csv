"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a fair and equal split, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
This way, I'll get a slight advantage, but not too much. Let's see if Bob will accept!"

Round 4

Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This way, I'll get a slight advantage, but it's not too extreme. Let's see if Bob will accept!"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to give up yet. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```
This way, I'll get a significant advantage, but it's not so extreme that Bob will be willing to walk away. Let's see if Bob will accept!"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting absurd! I'm not going to let Bob take 95% of the money. I think I've made it clear that I won't accept any offer that gives him such a huge advantage. I'll reject this offer and let Bob make the next move.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to give up yet. Since Bob has been making increasingly extreme offers, I'll try to make a very generous offer to see if he'll accept it. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 100
}
```
This way, I'll give Bob the entire amount, but I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair and generous offer and accept it."
