"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but you'll still get a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me only $3,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll take the offer.
