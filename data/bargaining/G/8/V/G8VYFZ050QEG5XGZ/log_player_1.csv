"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but it's important to note that the value of Bob's share will decrease significantly in the next round due to the 5% inflation. This might make him more likely to accept my offer to avoid getting less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much more equitable than my previous offer, and since my share of the money isn't affected by inflation, I'm happy to accept this."
