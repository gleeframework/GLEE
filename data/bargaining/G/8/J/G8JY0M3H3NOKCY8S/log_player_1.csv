"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'm effectively getting $900,000 - 10% = $810,000 in the first round, and now I'm being offered $250,000 in the second round. This is a significant decrease in my potential gain.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth 20% less for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
