"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 420000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Don't let inflation eat away your share 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would give me less than half of the original amount after inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer, but time is definitely becoming a factor."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly and end the game.  A 50/50 split is the fairest I can offer with the time remaining.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split wasn't so fair considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to use the inflation against me. While the offer is only slightly worse than last round, accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to worse offers later. I need to show I'm willing to risk it all to get a reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer Alice.  Accept this and we both walk away with something.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is agonizing, but I have to be realistic.  Alice is playing hardball and the clock is running out. If I reject this, her next offer will likely be even worse, and I'm rapidly approaching a point where even a marginally better offer won't be worth the lost value due to inflation."
