"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a fair offer, but let's see how things go! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's fair, but I can potentially get more by negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a bit more in my favor, but I'm open to discussion. Let's see if we can find a way to both benefit!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I would have preferred a higher percentage for myself in the earlier rounds, the risk of further inflation makes an even split the best option at this point."
