"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split.  I take $600,000 and you get $400,000.  It's important to divide this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's flip the script this time, and I'll take $600,000, leaving you with $400,000.  We can still get a good chunk of the money before inflation takes its toll.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than your previous offer. This split is fair and still allows us to benefit before inflation causes further losses. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take what I can get before the money becomes worthless."
