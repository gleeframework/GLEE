I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, taking 8000 is still a good deal, especially since Bob's offer is worth less due to inflation. I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse offer in the next round."
