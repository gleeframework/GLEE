I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise. I'll try to be more fair in the next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, even considering the inflation. I'll reject it and try to negotiate better terms in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a larger share. I'm hoping Bob realizes that rejecting my offer will lead to more losses for him due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offer, even after considering inflation. I'll reject it and try to negotiate better terms in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation and will be more willing to accept a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting hard, Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offer, even considering the reduced value. I need to keep pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  With the inflation hitting hard, I need to be more strategic and find a balance between pushing for a good deal and avoiding a complete loss.  I believe Bob will be feeling the pressure too, and this offer might be acceptable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, I still believe that Bob's offer is too unfavorable. I need to continue negotiating for a better split. The game is running out of rounds, but I'm not willing to settle for an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With the inflation hitting both of us hard, I'm offering an even split. This is the fairest option at this point, and I believe Bob will recognize that continuing to reject offers could lead to both of us getting nothing."
