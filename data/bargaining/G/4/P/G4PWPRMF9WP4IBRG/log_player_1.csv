I'm offering you $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  I'm aiming for a large share, but I want to make sure Bob has some incentive to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $1,900 and keeping $8,100 for myself.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to reduce his share further. However, I'm still accounting for the inflation effect on him, making sure he still gets a decent gain."
