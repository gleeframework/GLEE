"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the current circumstances. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 90% of $6,000, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is now worth 87.5% of $6,300.

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that a 55/45 split is fair, especially since he's trying to sway me with a sense of urgency. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 81% of $6,000, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is now worth 81.25% of $6,800.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more balanced split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to find a middle ground and hoping Bob will accept."
