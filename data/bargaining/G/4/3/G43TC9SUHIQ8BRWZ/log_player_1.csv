"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although the money I get is less than my original proposal, I would rather take what I can now than risk getting nothing at all if the game goes on."
