Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll, let's be reasonable and split it 52/48. We're both losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 

Even though it's not the ideal split, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases. Accepting a 48/52 split now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Uncertain Outcome:** There's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might hold out, hoping you'll become more desperate.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Accepting this offer shows a willingness to compromise, which could be beneficial in future interactions (if there are any). 

While getting a slightly smaller share isn't ideal, it's the most rational choice in the face of inflation and an uncertain bargaining partner."
