"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm going to start by offering Bob a small portion of the money. I figure if he's smart, he'll know that it's better to take something than nothing, especially since he'll have the chance to propose a better offer next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take half than risk getting nothing."
