"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a 90/10 split.  This gives you a good starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  While 100,000 is a good starting point,  I'm hoping for a more even split and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and gives us both a good starting point for the game.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I still believe a 70/30 split is fairer considering the value of the money decreases more for you with each round.  Let's make progress towards a solution. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I appreciate the compromise, I still feel 70/30 is too unbalanced. I believe we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to a 60/40 split in your favor, recognizing the inflation affects me more. Let's meet halfway and avoid further losses.""}
