"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd rather have a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since my money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% in round 2 and another 20% in round 3), I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With my money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I need to be cautious. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get at this point.
