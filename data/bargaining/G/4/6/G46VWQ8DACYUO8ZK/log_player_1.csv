"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I hope Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $450,000 in the second round is equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. I think this is a reasonable offer from Bob, considering the initial offer I made was already a 60-40 split. I'll accept this offer.
