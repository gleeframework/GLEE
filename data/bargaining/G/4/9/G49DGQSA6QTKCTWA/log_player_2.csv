This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Hurts:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. Waiting any longer means I'll be getting even less.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** She's consistently offered me less, and her last message suggests she thinks I'm getting desperate. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While 4500 is much less than I wanted, it's better than risking another round and getting an even worse offer, or reaching a point where the inflation makes the whole thing pointless."
