"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this one favors Bob a bit too much. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still keeping a decent share for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
