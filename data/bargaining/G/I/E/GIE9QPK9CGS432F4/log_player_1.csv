"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and with the inflation, it's better than risking getting nothing."
