"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but give you a small taste to keep you happy. This is just the beginning, though.

# Alice gain: 990000

""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to play tough.  I'm willing to compromise, but your offer is still too generous. Let's split it 95/5, and I'll make sure you get a decent return on your investment.  The longer we wait, the more we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear me down with the threat of inflation, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's better to hold out and propose a more equitable split, even with the impact of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back-and-forth isn't helping. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice by presenting this as my final offer.  A 60/40 split, even with inflation, is significantly better than what she's offered. The ""take it or leave it"" approach might push her to accept before the money loses more value for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're both stubborn.  I'm not backing down from my position. This offer is my final one.  I'm willing to take 90% of the pie, but you'll get 10%.  Think about it.  If you reject this, you'll be left with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation rate, waiting any longer is too risky. While Alice's offer is still heavily in her favor, accepting $100,000 now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds where the money will be worth even less. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the most logical choice at this point."
