Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try to get the most money I can, but I also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer. I'm offering him $10, which is better than nothing.  I'll see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would like to get more, the inflation means that my $90 offer is worth $81 now, and the value will continue to decrease with each round.  Accepting Bob's offer will guarantee me $50, which is better than risking getting less in the future."
