"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I propose a split of 810,000 for me and 190,000 for Bob.  This is a reasonable compromise after our previous rounds, and still takes into account the ongoing inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I propose a split of 729,000 for me and 271,000 for Bob.  Given the continued inflation, I need to keep a larger share to maintain my initial value. This offer still offers Bob a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

This is a fair offer, considering the significant inflation we've experienced.  I am willing to concede more to Bob as this is the last round before I receive no value from the money at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, given the current inflation, I am willing to accept this offer to avoid getting nothing.  It's better than nothing at all, as my value is now significantly diminished."
