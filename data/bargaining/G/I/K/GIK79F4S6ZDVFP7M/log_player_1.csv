"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm feeling generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 10% decrease in my gains due to inflation!

However, I'm willing to consider Bob's offer. Since he's being ""generous"", I'll accept his proposal:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the $400,000 and hope that Bob's generosity will continue in future rounds!"
