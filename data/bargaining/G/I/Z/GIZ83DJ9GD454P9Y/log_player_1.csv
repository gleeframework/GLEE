"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This way, I get 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offer, I'll consider it a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
