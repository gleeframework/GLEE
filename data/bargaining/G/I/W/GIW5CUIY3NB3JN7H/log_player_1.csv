Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a better deal. Time is on my side 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

This is a tough situation. While I'd like to hold out for more, Bob is clearly content to wait me out. The value of the money is decreasing substantially for me with each round. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in a future round.  It's better to take the guaranteed $40 now (worth only $59.05 of the original value) than risk getting a worse deal later."
