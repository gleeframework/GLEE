"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation affecting me. However, Bob's gain is now worth 5% less due to inflation.

Considering this, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject the offer. Since Bob's offer is still quite close to the original 50/50 split, I'll decide to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again! Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then made a slightly more favorable offer, I'll try to make an even more generous offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000}

I'm offering Bob $480,000, which is 48% of the total amount. This is a slightly better deal for him than my initial offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, Bob's offer is now even more attractive to me. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation affecting me. However, Bob's gain is now worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'll decide to accept it.
