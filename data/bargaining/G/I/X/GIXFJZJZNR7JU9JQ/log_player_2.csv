Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I want to see what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  We both get half. It's the best way to ensure we both get a good deal!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, inflation is a factor. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further losses."
