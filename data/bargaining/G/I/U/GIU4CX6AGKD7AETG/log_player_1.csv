"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and avoid excessive devaluation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to make a sacrifice. This offer leaves us both better off than another round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as beneficial, it's important to consider the future. Another round of inflation will hurt me more than him.  I need to push for a more favorable split now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. Let's settle this now with a 55/45 split in my favor. It's better than risking further devaluation for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Bob's tactic from the previous round, but with a split that favors me.  This offer is still better for him than another round of inflation, and it allows me to regain some of the ground lost in the devaluation."
