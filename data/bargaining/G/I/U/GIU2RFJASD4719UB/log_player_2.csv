Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases if I continue to reject Alice's offers.
* **Diminishing returns:**  The value of Alice's potential gains is rapidly decreasing. While my gains are not affected by inflation, her willingness to accept a less favorable deal will likely lessen with each round.  
* **Guaranteed payout:** Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable share of the money.  

Continuing to push for a larger share at this point is too risky, and could lead to both of us losing everything."
