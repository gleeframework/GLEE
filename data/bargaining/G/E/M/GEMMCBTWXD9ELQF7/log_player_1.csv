"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** I want to begin with an offer that heavily favors me (Alice) while still appearing somewhat reasonable to Bob.  
* **Time Sensitivity:**  It's crucial Bob understands that time is against me due to inflation.  A delayed agreement means less money for me, even if the final split remains the same.
* **Future Leverage:** This opening offer gives me room to negotiate down in later rounds if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation factor, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting this deal would mean I lose a significant amount of potential earnings due to the 20% inflation already incurred.  It's worth risking another round to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this scenario. Let's settle this now - my offer is still better than a 50/50 split after another round of inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split, recognizing that a deal needs to be struck soon.  
* **Inflation Emphasis:** I'm explicitly reminding Bob of the time pressure and how further delay hurts my position, making my current offer more appealing.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  By framing my offer as ""better than 50/50 after inflation,"" I'm subtly positioning it as a fair and even generous compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation has hit the 48.8% mark, meaning my potential gains are rapidly dwindling.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in further rounds is increasingly risky. The potential gains are now outweighed by the guaranteed losses from inflation. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, and while not ideal, it prevents further losses from inflation.  

It's better to secure a reasonable deal now than risk ending up with a much smaller portion due to continued inflation."
