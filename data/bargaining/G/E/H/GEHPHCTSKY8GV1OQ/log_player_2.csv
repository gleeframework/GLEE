Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split this round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than what I'd get if we continue, and it's not a bad deal for me."
