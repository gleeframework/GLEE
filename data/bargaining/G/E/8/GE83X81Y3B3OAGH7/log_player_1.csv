"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will take 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a larger share of the money.

I'll have to consider the effects of inflation, though. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, I'll gain $300,000, which is 30% of the remaining $1,000,000. That's a relatively small share, considering the original offer I made was 60%.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob will take 58%. I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take a larger share of the money.

Let's calculate the actual value of the money in this round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the effects of inflation.

In this round, I'll gain $200,000, which is 20% of the remaining $1,000,000. However, considering the effects of inflation, the actual value of my gain is even lower.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 36% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob will take 64%. I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
