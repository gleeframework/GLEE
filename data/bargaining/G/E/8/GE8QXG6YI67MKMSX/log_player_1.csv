"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we should both benefit more than 40% each. This is a better deal for both of us.  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still a significant improvement over my initial offer, and it's a 50/50 split, which is more even.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
