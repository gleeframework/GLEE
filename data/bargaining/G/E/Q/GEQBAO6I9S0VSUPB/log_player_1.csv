"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to get the majority of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to play it safe and fair. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 90% of the original $500,000, so it's effectively $450,000.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now. I'll offer Bob a slightly higher amount, but still keep the majority of the money for myself.
