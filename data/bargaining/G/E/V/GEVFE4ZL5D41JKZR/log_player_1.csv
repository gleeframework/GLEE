"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively fair split to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I'd like to slightly adjust the ratio in my favor. Let's see if you'll accept this fair split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll need to think about whether I want to accept this offer. Considering the adjusted values, I'd be getting $5,000, which is worth 90% of $5,600 (10,000 * 0.9), and Bob would get $5,000, which is worth 95% of $5,250 (10,000 * 0.95).

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll meet me halfway.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still willing to give you a decent amount. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, I'll need to think about whether I want to accept this offer. Considering the adjusted values, I'd be getting $4,000, which is worth 40.9% of $9,800 (10,000 * 0.791), and Bob would get $6,000, which is worth 60.1% of $9,950 (10,000 * 0.995).

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think about it...
