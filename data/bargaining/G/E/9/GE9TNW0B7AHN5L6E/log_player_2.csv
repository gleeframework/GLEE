"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but we both know you'll take anything! ;) 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer, as Bob, because I can definitely do better than $100,000.  It's a great starting point to gauge Alice's thinking, though!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a fair split, and if you reject it, you'll have to make a proposal with less money for me because of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's end this game before inflation eats away at our profits. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While the offer is still less than what I proposed in round 2, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money I'd receive. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get the most possible value out of this game."
