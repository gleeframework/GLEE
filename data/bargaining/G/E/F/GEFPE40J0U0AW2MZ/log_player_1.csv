"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, with me getting 60% of the total amount and Bob getting 40%. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as 6000 / 0.8 = 7500.

My gain, on the other hand, is still 4000.

Considering the effective gains, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's gain was 6000 in the previous round, and it's worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim to make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
