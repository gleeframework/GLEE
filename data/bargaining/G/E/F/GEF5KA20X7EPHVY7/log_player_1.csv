"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the total, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal. Your turn!""

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 35% of the total, even with the reduced value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm starting to get a bit worried about the time running out."

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, given the time constraint. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going to take a chance and offer you a 50/50 split again. It's now or never!""
}
```

I'm going back to the original 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept it and we can finally divide the money. I'm not sure if I can afford to wait for a better offer, given the time constraint."
