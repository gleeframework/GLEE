"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate more if needed""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split and see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it more evenly this time.  We both get a little more than we did in your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain would be $48 (60% of $80, which is 80% of $100 after inflation).

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a bit more, considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the current value of $100, which is $45, and keeping 55% for myself, which is $55."
