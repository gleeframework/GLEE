"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm also the one making the offer now.  Let's see if you agree to this deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 20% decrease in value of my potential gain due to inflation.

However, I'll consider Bob's offer. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is still a decent amount. But I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll wait for the next round to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's see if you'll accept this one!""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share, $520,000, and keep $480,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The longer we wait, the less money we both get. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

I'm not thrilled about the 48.8% decrease in value, but I need to consider Bob's final offer. If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial share.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, considering the rapid inflation. Bob's message about the longer we wait, the less money we both get, is also a concern.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take Bob's offer and hope that I can make the most of it."
