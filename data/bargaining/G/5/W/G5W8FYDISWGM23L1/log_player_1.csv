"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 900,000$ to 100,000$ split in my favor.  This is a pretty generous offer, considering the inflation rate will negatively impact Bob much more than me.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is a lot better than nothing, it's still way less than I could potentially get.  Inflation is hurting Bob more than me, so I'm going to try to push for a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000$ to 300,000$ split in my favor. This is still a very generous offer considering the inflation rate and Bob's higher percentage loss.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that Bob should accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split,  Bob's offer is still significantly better than the previous round. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, so I'm likely not going to get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer."
