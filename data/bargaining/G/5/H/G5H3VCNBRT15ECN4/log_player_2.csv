"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation over the 12 rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's risky to accept so early on. I'm hoping to get a larger share by rejecting and seeing what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 75/25 in my favor. I'm willing to share a bit, but I'm also confident I can get a better deal later if you reject.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rate, I propose a division of 60/40. This aims to balance fairness and the risk of devaluation over the remaining rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise. While I'd prefer a larger share, the 40/60 split is a fair deal considering the potential for further inflation and the fact that I have already rejected one offer. It's important to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
