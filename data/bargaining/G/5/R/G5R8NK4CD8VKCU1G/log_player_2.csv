"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is generous and saves us both from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation rate. Let's end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Let's be practical and end this before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher percentage, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Inflation is hurting Alice more, so it's likely she won't budge further. This is a decent gain, and it's better to take it now."
