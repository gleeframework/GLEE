"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation we're dealing with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation, which doesn't affect Alice but impacts me significantly. Given that each round decreases the value by 20% for me, I need to adjust accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation on my end, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable to compensate for the loss in value over rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on inflation, but your previous ask was a bit too much. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation, I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll make another proposal in the next round, aiming to find a better balance considering the current 36% decrease in value for my share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As we're in the fourth round, the money I gain is now worth even less due to inflation. Considering this, I'll adjust my proposal to try and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at a 36% decrease in value, I'm hoping this adjusted offer will meet us halfway, considering the urgency and the disproportionate effect of inflation on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I've adjusted my offer slightly, recognizing the time constraint, but I won't accept an uneven deal. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where my share is worth 59.04% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference in value due to inflation significantly impacts my potential gain, making further negotiation less advantageous. Accepting now mitigates further loss in value."
