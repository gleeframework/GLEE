"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on my end, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable to compensate for the loss in value over rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, now at a 36% decrease in value, I'm hoping this adjusted offer will meet us halfway, considering the urgency and the disproportionate effect of inflation on my end. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is exaggerating the impact of inflation. While it's true his potential gains are diminishing, my gains remain constant. He's using this to justify increasingly uneven splits.  I need to hold firm to secure a fair outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I've adjusted my offer slightly, recognizing the time constraint, but I won't accept an uneven deal. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, the pressure to reach an agreement increases. Bob's offers suggest he understands this urgency.
* **Shifting the Frame:**  By focusing on a ""fair compromise"" rather than solely on inflation, I aim to steer the negotiation away from Bob's inflated sense of loss. 
* **Strategic Concession:** The slight decrease in my share (from 5500 to 5200) signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains a position of strength."
