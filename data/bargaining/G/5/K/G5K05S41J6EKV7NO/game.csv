70.0,30.0,"I propose dividing the money in a 70:30 ratio. This might not seem fair, but consider the inflation factor. In the next round, the value of money decreases by 10%. If we don't agree now, the situation will only get worse for you.",Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I propose a 60:40 split, with me taking 60.  While the money is worth less for you with each round, it's also worth less for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I believe this split is fairer considering the declining value of the money for both of us.",Bob,2,
40.0,60.0,"Your offer seems reasonable, given the inflation factor and our respective losses in value. However, I think we can do better. I would accept a 55:45 split.",Alice,2,accept
