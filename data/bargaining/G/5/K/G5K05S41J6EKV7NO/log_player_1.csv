"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 70:30 ratio. This might not seem fair, but consider the inflation factor. In the next round, the value of money decreases by 10%. If we don't agree now, the situation will only get worse for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60:40 split, with me taking 60.  While the money is worth less for you with each round, it's also worth less for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I believe this split is fairer considering the declining value of the money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Your offer seems reasonable, given the inflation factor and our respective losses in value. However, I think we can do better. I would accept a 55:45 split."",
