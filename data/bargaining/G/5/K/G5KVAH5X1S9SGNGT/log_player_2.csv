"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on only hurts me. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
