"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This offer splits the money fairly close to a 50/50 split, but gives Alice a slight advantage. This is a good starting point, as it's reasonable and gives Alice a bit of a cushion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to Alice than the initial offer, and the inflation only makes it worse for Alice. It's better to keep playing and try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

This round, I'm proposing an even split. This is a fair offer and might be more appealing to Bob than the previous offer.  Since inflation is hurting both of us, it's likely that a fair deal will be more attractive to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than the previous round, and the inflation is starting to seriously affect the value of the money.  It's better to keep playing and see if Bob will come closer to a fair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This offer is a compromise. It gives Bob a slight advantage, but it's still closer to a 50/50 split than Bob's offer, and it's worth trying to reach a deal before the inflation gets too out of hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the inflation is making the potential gains much smaller.  I need to hold out for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share for Bob this time. With the inflation,  it's important to find a deal soon, and this is a compromise that could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable. The inflation is hurting both of us, but Bob seems to be ignoring it. There's still a chance for a more fair deal, and I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

With inflation getting worse and Bob's offers increasingly unfair, I'm offering a slight compromise to hopefully reach a deal.  It's important to avoid reaching the final rounds, where the value of the money decreases significantly."
