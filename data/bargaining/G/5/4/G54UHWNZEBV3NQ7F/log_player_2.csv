Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I think I can get a better deal than 40% of the money. Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. How about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm happy to take 45% of the money.  It's better than my last offer, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
