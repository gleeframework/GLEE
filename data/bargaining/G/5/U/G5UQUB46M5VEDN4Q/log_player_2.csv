Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical.  The value decreases rapidly for both of us. This is a better offer for me considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal considering the significant inflation we both face. Let's end this before it gets any worse.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer benefits us both, but time is running out, especially for you. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer results in a smaller loss than continuing to negotiate and further devaluing the money.
