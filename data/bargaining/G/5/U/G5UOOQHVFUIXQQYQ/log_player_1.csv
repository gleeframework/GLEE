"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 10% less, $2000 is now equivalent to $1800 in the original value. It's still a relatively small share, but I'll have to weigh the risks of continuing the game.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, let's wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chance to reconsider, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money! The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject. With the money worth 27.1% less than the original, $3000 is now equivalent to $2200 in the original value, which is a relatively small share.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, considering the inflation is accelerating. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
