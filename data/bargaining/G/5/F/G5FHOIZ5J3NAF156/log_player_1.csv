"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share, hoping to secure a deal early.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing more.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure something now."
