"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly!"
