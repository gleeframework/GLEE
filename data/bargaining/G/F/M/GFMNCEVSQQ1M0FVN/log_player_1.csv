I'm taking a very risky approach here. I'm offering Bob the bare minimum to avoid him rejecting my offer. The goal is to get the money in my hands as quickly as possible before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal for me than the previous one. While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, it's still a substantial amount and it eliminates the risk of inflation further eroding my share in the next round."
