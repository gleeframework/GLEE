Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 437500 
# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant for Bob.  While 437,500 is less than his ideal outcome, rejecting this offer and potentially receiving an even worse offer in the next round due to inflation is too risky. It's better to take a slightly less favorable deal now than risk losing even more value."
