Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'll take a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation is hitting Bob hard, making this the most advantageous offer for him.  Accepting ensures he gets something, while rejecting risks ending up with nothing due to further inflation."
