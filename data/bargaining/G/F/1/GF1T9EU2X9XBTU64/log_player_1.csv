"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not giving away all the money on the first round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $380,000 (95% of $400,000).

I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away more than 55% of the total. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

Considering the inflation, my gain of $550,000 is actually worth $517,500 (95% of $550,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less each round, and this is the 4th round, the money is worth 0.95^4 = 0.8146 or 81.46% of the original amount.

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $365,730 (81.46% of $450,000).

I think Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
