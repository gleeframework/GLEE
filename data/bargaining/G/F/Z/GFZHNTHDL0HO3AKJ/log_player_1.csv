"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 is a good starting point. We both get a significant share, and we can avoid the risk of losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
