"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 90% and you get 10%. It's a good start, but we can always renegotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 is something, it's a very small percentage of the total.  It's worth risking a round to see if Alice will be more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
