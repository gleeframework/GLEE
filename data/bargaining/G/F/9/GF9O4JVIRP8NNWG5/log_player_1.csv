"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'll have to be more cautious.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a bit more favorable to me, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money, I'll have to be even more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. The offer is too skewed in his favor, and I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my offer for Round 5:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm pushing for a 70% share of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%. This is a more assertive offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it."
