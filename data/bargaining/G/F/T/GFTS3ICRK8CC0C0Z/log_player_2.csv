"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. With 20% inflation, the money will be worth less, but I'm hoping Alice will make a more generous offer to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think 55% for me is a fair offer, considering the money is worth 20% less now.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now, so I'm offering a slightly more uneven split in my favor. Let's see if Alice accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's getting late, Bob. I'll take a little less, 52% to your 48%. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the money is now worth 36% less than the original amount, I think 48% is a reasonable share. I don't want to risk losing even more value, so I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
