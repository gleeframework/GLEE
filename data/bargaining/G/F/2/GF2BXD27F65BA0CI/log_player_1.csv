"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Considering the new values, I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreased value.

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split, where I get 42% and Bob gets 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the new values, I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is still quite favorable to him, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving up more, but I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value...
