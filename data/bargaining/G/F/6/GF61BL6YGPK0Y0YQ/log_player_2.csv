Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to be generous, the inflation is working significantly in my favor.  I need to hold out for a better deal to make the most of this advantage as time goes on."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a factor, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. Offering a 50/50 split now seems like a strong strategic move. It's fair, simple, and avoids the risk of running out of time and getting nothing."
