"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I should try to get a better offer in the next rounds. Alice's offer of 1000 for me and 9000 for her is not fair considering the decreasing value of money for me. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it more fairly considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although Alice has increased her offer to 4000 for me, considering the 19% decrease in value due to inflation, this amount is actually less valuable than it seems. In the next rounds, I should try to get an even better offer to compensate for the loss in value. Rejecting this offer and proceeding to the next round may give me a better chance to get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's be reasonable and split it 70/30. This way, we both get something before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although the offer has increased in nominal value, considering the 34.39% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual value of the 3000 I would receive is significantly lower than it initially seems. With 7 rounds remaining, there is still room to negotiate for a better deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I will reject this offer and try to get a more favorable deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it equally to account for the significant decrease in value I'm experiencing due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my position. We need to finalize this before the value drops too much further.  I'm offering 80/20, which is a reasonable compromise considering the current inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although the nominal value of Alice's offer has decreased, considering the 46.86% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual value of the 2000 I would receive is significantly lower than it initially seems. With 5 rounds remaining, there is still room to negotiate for a better deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. However, I should be cautious and consider that Alice may not be willing to compromise further. I will reject this offer and try to get a more favorable deal in the next rounds, but I should also be prepared to accept a less favorable offer if necessary to avoid getting nothing."
