I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round. It's risky, but I figure Bob might be tempted to accept rather than risk the inflation and potentially get less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is very tempting, but I'm not going to accept it just yet. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly but still aim for a significant share.  I'm hoping Bob will see that the inflation is working against him, and he'll be more likely to accept something closer to my terms."
