"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't ideal for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\nI'm taking into account the 20% inflation that will affect my share if we don't agree in this round, so I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for that. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value decreases quickly, Bob. I'll take a slightly larger share, but we should settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer of a 35/65 split is less favorable than her initial 40/60 split, and I'm not ready to settle for that yet. I'll take the risk of another round to try and get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value for me, I'm willing to take a slightly higher share to compensate. Let's settle on a 58/42 split before the value drops further.""}\n\nGiven the rapid decrease in value, I'm trying to balance the need for a fair split with the urgency to settle before the money loses even more value. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise, considering the time-sensitive nature of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take the offer now before the money is worth even less for you! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, accepting Alice's offer seems to be the most reasonable decision. The money is worth almost 60% less for me than in the first round, and further negotiations would likely result in even greater losses due to inflation. While the 30/70 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round and ending up with even less."
