"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Fair share, considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, Alice suggests a division where she receives $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500, along with a message that this is a ""Fair share, considering inflation."" This division slightly favors Alice but takes into account the higher rate of inflation affecting Bob's share in subsequent rounds, making it a somewhat equitable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking into account the inflation, and I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the effects of inflation, Bob's proposed split seems overly skewed in his favor. The initial rejection and the significant decrease in value for Bob's share due to inflation should not result in such a substantial disparity. A more balanced approach, considering both inflation rates, is needed for a fair agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased inflation impact on your end, this is a more balanced offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the increased impact of inflation on Bob's share. By proposing that I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the greater depreciation of the money's value for Bob, while also ensuring I don't overly compromise my own share. This adjustment aims to encourage Bob to accept, recognizing the diminishing value of further negotiation."
