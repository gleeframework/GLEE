"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. Since I'm losing 10% per round, I want to try and get more than half of the money in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I need a larger share for myself to compensate for the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle and account for inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a bigger share, it's better to take this offer than risk losing more money to inflation. This is a decent compromise considering the diminishing value of the money with each round."
