"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not willing to settle for 40% of the money just yet. The inflation rate is higher for me, so I want to try to get a better deal before the money loses too much value. Bring on Round 2!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split. With inflation looming, I think we should aim for a fairer division to benefit us both.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a slight advantage, considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing. I'm hoping Alice will see the reason in my proposal and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our potential gains. This is a serious offer, slightly better for you than last round considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI appreciate Alice's willingness to slightly improve the offer, but I still believe I can get a better deal. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and push for a more favorable split. The difference in inflation rates between us means that every round costs me more than it costs Alice, so I need to aim for a higher gain to compensate. On to Round 4!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, and I'm feeling the pinch more than you. I think this offer is more reflective of the urgency and the differing inflation rates we're facing. Let's settle on this before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the increasing pressure from inflation and the fact that I'm losing more value with each passing round, I've decided to make an offer that prioritizes my gains. I've explained my reasoning to Alice, hoping she'll understand the urgency and accept this proposal. The gap between our inflation rates is significant, and I believe this offer accounts for that disparity. Fingers crossed for a positive response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your greed. This offer is a compromise. Take it before inflation eats up even more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand Alice's frustration, but I still believe her offer doesn't adequately account for the difference in inflation rates between us. At this point, I've lost over a third of the value of my potential gains due to inflation, while Alice has lost less than 20%. Her offer of 4600 is actually worth less to me now than her initial offer of 4000 was in Round 1, considering the effects of inflation. I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating for a better deal, despite the mounting pressure. Bring on Round 6!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand we're both losing out, but the inflation disparity means I'm hurting more. This offer reflects that. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree, as the value is decreasing rapidly for me.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've made a more assertive offer, prioritizing my gains due to the significant impact of inflation on my side. I've lost over a third of the value already, and I believe this split better reflects the urgency and the unequal effects of inflation on our potential gains. I've communicated my reasoning to Alice, making it clear that I'm prepared to risk further negotiation or even walking away if we can't reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The pressure is on, but I'm hoping this offer will bring us closer to a resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation as well, and this split acknowledges the urgency without being unfair. If you reject this, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation and the risk of walking away with nothing, I've decided to accept Alice's offer. At this point, the 4900 I'm gaining is worth less than 53% of its original value, but it's still better than losing everything. Alice's message indicates that this is her final offer, and I believe the risk of pushing for another round outweighs the potential benefits. It's time to settle and make the most of a difficult situation. I accept the offer, and we can conclude the game here."
