I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, considering the potential for inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my demand to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. This is still a fair offer, given the inflation and the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
