"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  It's a big chunk for me, but it's also a fair starting point.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate or if he'll try to get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's significantly less than my original proposal, inflation has made it clear that I need to be more flexible.  $200,000 is still a good gain, especially given the risk of further reductions in the next round."
