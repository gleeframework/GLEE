"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 400,000 and Bob will take 600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to counter 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. The 300,000 I'll get is actually worth less than the 400,000 I initially proposed. On the other hand, the 700,000 Bob will get is worth 10% less than his initial proposal, so it's not as bad as it seems.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} This offer is still not good enough for me. I'll wait for the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent chunk""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by proposing a 35-65 split, where I'll take 350,000 and Bob will take 650,000. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too high, I'm trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess the offer. The 450,000 I'll get is worth even less than the 350,000 I initially proposed, and the 550,000 Bob will get is worth even less than the 700,000 he initially proposed.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} This offer is still not good enough for me. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 380000, ""bob_gain"": 620000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm trying to find a compromise by proposing a 38-62 split, where I'll take 380,000 and Bob will take 620,000. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
