"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a good deal, Alice, but it's my turn to propose.  This seems fairer given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. Let's settle this now with a compromise.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is indeed a problem, Alice, but it mostly affects you. I need a better deal to agree. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough situation, and Bob is clearly using the inflation mechanic to his advantage. However, accepting $3,500 is a significant loss, especially knowing it's worth even less due to inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means taking a risk."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob. I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split to end this now before the inflation eats away at everything.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm taking a gamble here.  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the fairest offer and Bob might be enticed to accept a sure thing rather than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  The longer this drags on, the less favorable it becomes for me due to the inflation."
