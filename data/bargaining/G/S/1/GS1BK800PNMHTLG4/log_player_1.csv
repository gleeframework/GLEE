"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more"" to justify my slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it 60/40, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, his proposed split doesn't seem fair to me, especially since the money is worth 10% less to me now. I'd rather make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less than before. This is my final offer.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Given the impact of inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, but I've made it clear that this is my final offer to pressure Bob into accepting. Let's see how he responds!"
