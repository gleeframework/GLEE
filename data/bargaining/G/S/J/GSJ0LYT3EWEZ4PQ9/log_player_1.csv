"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good start""
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $80 and leave $20 for Bob. The message is just a friendly gesture to see if Bob will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. No need for inflation to hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, considering the inflation is affecting me more. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting me more, I'll try to get a bigger share this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a decent offer""
}
```"
