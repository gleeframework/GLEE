"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $4000 is now worth $3200.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's not as generous as my previous one. I'll reject it and try to do better next time.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my gain will be worth 40% less than in the first round, due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
