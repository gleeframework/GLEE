Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we have time to be fair. This is the same offer you proposed last round, but with the gains reversed to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet in the middle, but we need to factor in the inflation. This is a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make it seem fair, the time pressure heavily favors her.  I need to push for a larger share while it's still advantageous to settle rather than risk getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a small hit on the split to end this now.  It's in your best interest to accept.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for me, making it crucial to settle sooner rather than later. 
* **Shifting the Balance:**  While my previous 50/50 offer was rejected, I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but still hold a slight advantage.
* **Direct Language:**  Alice is stalling, hoping I'll panic as the rounds progress.  I need to convey urgency and firmness in my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the same split you offered last round, adjusted for the inflation we both know is happening. It's a fair deal at this point. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly just stalling and trying to turn my own offers against me. It's frustrating, but I can't afford to accept a deal where she gains more.  The inflation is hurting, but I need to hold out for a slightly better deal for another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5050,
""alice_gain"": 4950,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm making one last compromise. Accept this, or we both lose out. Don't play with fire.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is it â€“ no more back and forth. This adds pressure on Alice to settle now.
* **Slight Advantage:**  While a very small advantage for me, it's psychologically important to not let Alice think she's winning.
* **Strong Language:**  The message needs to be assertive without being outright aggressive. I want to convey that I'm serious about walking away if she doesn't accept. 

The situation is getting critical, and I need to balance my desire for a favorable deal against the risk of getting nothing."
