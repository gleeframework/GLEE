Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's speed things up. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats into the value even more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob presents it as a 50/50 split, the inflation means he's getting a much better deal. It's likely he'll continue to offer slightly less favorable deals to himself each round, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of losing money to inflation.  I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better deal that acknowledges the impact of inflation on his gains."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a small hit on the split to end this now.  It's in your best interest to accept. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, but his offer is still  skewed in his favor due to the inflation.  He's trying to use the pressure of time to force a bad deal. I believe I can still get a slightly better split if I hold out a little longer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is the same split you offered last round, adjusted for the inflation we both know is happening. It's a fair deal at this point.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm making one last compromise. Accept this, or we both lose out. Don't play with fire. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted. While ideally, I'd want Bob to acknowledge the inflation more fairly, the risk of getting nothing is now very real.  Bob is clearly getting frustrated and may not be open to further negotiation. Accepting this offer guarantees I get something, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if we both continue to be stubborn."
