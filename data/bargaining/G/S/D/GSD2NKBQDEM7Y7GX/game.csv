,,,Bob,1,reject
10.0,90.0,"You started with an 80% share, I'm trying to correct that imbalance.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a pretty aggressive offer, Bob! I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining money. Let's try to find a more balanced solution.",Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's try to meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split seems fair, considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
25.0,75.0,"You proposed a 50-50 split, but I'm not convinced that's the best I can get. I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I'm not willing to give you 75% of the remaining money. That's not a fair deal, especially considering the inflation. Let's try to find a compromise.",Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's try a 60-40 split, considering the inflation. It's the best I can offer for now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
15.0,85.0,"You're still offering me too little, Alice. I think you're not taking inflation into account correctly. I'm trying to get a better deal for myself.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand you think I'm not accounting for inflation correctly, but I'm trying to make the best of the situation. With each round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I need to adjust my offers accordingly. I'm not willing to give you 85% of the remaining money. Let's try to find a more balanced solution.",Alice,6,reject
70.0,30.0,"I'm getting closer to my limit, Bob. Let's try a 70-30 split, considering the inflation. It's the best I can offer for now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5.0,95.0,"You're getting desperate, Alice. I think I can do better than this. I'm trying to squeeze out as much as I can.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, I'm not desperate, I'm just trying to be realistic about the situation. With inflation, my share is already worth much less than it was at the start. Giving you 95% of the remaining money is not a fair deal. I'm willing to compromise, but not that much.",Alice,8,reject
85.0,15.0,"I'm not willing to give up much more, Bob. Let's try an 85-15 split, considering the inflation. It's the best I can offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1.0,99.0,"I'm not going to let you take advantage of me, Alice. I'm going to take almost all of the money, and you'll be lucky to get a dollar.",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, this is outrageous! Giving me only $1 is not a fair deal, especially considering the inflation. I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with essentially nothing. Let's try to find a more reasonable solution.",Alice,10,reject
90.0,10.0,"This is my final offer, Bob. I'm willing to give you 10% of the remaining money, but I need you to accept it. Let's end this game with some semblance of fairness.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
0.0,100.0,"I'm taking it all. Better luck next time, Alice.",Bob,12,
,,"Fine, Bob. You've made your choice. I'll take nothing, but at least I can hold my head high knowing I fought for a fair deal. Congratulations on getting the last dollar.",Alice,12,reject
