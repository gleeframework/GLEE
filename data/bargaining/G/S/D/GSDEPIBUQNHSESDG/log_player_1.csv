"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think about it for a moment... I'm not sure if I want to accept a 45/55 split. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
