Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $600,000 is now worth $540,000, and I'm being offered $500,000. I'll have to decide...
