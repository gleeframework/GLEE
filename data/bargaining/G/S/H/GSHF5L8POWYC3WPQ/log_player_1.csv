  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks I'm being too greedy!

However, I'm not going to give in that easily. I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```

I'll stick to my original proposal, and hope that Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 45% and you get 55%. Let's make a deal?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too greedy, considering the decreasing value of the money. What do you think, Bob?"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to wear me down.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

However, I'm not going to give in just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to hold out for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Round 8

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is taking a firm stance.

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me a mere 10% share of the original $1,000,000. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, this is a very poor offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further, but I'm not optimistic.

```
{

```

I'll try to make one last attempt to salvage a better deal, but I'm not holding out much hope."
