"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split. This is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more balanced than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more. Can we try this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a more equal split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

However, I'm starting to think that Bob might be getting a bit too close to what I want. I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer to get this deal done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I need to be very careful with my decisions now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm surprised he's offering me a smaller share than before. I think he's trying to make a bold move to get the deal done. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
