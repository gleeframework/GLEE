"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. We can negotiate further, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal, considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is a reasonable counteroffer. Let's try to find a middle ground!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, a 50/50 split seems like the best option at this point. Further negotiations might not yield a better result due to the decreasing value of the money. It's time to settle!"
