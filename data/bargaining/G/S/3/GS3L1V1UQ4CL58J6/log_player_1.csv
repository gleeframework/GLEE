```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is feeling a bit greedy today!

I'll think carefully about this offer... Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, his gain of $6000 is equivalent to $5400 in the first round, which is a bit less than my initial offer of $5000. Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.
