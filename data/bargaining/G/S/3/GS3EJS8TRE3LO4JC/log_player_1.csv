"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a very unfair offer, and while I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a more equitable split.  This should be fair to both of us, and I'm hoping Bob sees the value in ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided.  I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, but I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but still trying to be fair. This should be a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation rate.  Let's see if Bob will finally accept."
