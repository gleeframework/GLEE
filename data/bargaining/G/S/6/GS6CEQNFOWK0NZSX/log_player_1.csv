"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not how fairness works. Let's be reasonable - this offer prevents the money from losing value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This offer is fair and prevents us both from losing too much to inflation. Let's end this now.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is eating away at your share more than mine.  This is my final offer - let's be logical and end this before we both lose more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is the most advantageous given the current inflation rate and the fact that I'll be the one losing more in the next round if I reject.  It's time to end this."
