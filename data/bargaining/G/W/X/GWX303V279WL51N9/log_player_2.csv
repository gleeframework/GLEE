"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is pretty good for her, but not so much for me.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round. Inflation hurts Alice more than me, so she's likely to offer more favorable terms as time goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but this time it's my turn for a slightly larger share. Think about the inflation!""} 
``` 

Let me explain my thinking:

* **Turning the Tables:** Alice was aiming for a larger share in Round 1. By offering her slightly less than what I was offered, I signal that I'm also aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Inflation Factor:** While the message mentions inflation, the offer itself takes it into account. Alice loses value faster with each round, making her more likely to accept an offer that's less beneficial than what she might have hoped for initially. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer isn't overly aggressive. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it, allowing me to potentially secure a slightly better deal in Round 3."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being more than fair now 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Bites:**  While 43 is less than the 45 I wanted, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Holding out for another round means risking an even smaller gain. 
* **Alice's Perspective:** Alice is likely feeling the pressure of inflation even more than I am. Her offer, while still in her favor, is more balanced than her first one. This suggests she's serious about reaching an agreement.

Overall, accepting this offer now avoids the risk of getting even less in the future."
