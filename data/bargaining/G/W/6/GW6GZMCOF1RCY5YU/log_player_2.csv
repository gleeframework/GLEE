Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we both know this is going nowhere.  This is my best offer, let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 271000 
# Alice gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Even though it's not a great split, accepting is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is experiencing significant inflation. Her potential gains are decreasing rapidly with each round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in future rounds is risky. Alice might offer even less, knowing her losses are less significant with each round.
* **Present Value:** While $271,000 isn't ideal, it's a guaranteed amount right now.  

It's better for Bob to take a reasonable, albeit imperfect, offer now than gamble on getting a better deal later and potentially ending up with even less.
