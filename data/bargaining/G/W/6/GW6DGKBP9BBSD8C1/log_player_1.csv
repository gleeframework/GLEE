"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob accepts or wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather have a smaller amount now than a larger amount later on. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve more""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather have a smaller amount now than a larger amount later on. However, I think I can do better than 30. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 32, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```"
