"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more substantial increase from his initial rejection. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, so I'm increasing my offer to $75 and reducing Bob's share to $25. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time running out, and I think Bob's offer is a decent compromise. I'm willing to accept $80 and leave $20 for Bob. It's not perfect, but it's a reasonable split considering the circumstances."
