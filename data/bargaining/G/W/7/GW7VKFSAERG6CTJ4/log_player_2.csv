**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me significantly. It's better to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split. We are running out of time and this is the fairest offer for both of us.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The increasing rate of inflation means I'm losing ground rapidly. A 50/50 split is now the most logical offer. It guarantees me a reasonable amount, and the clear fairness might push Alice to accept before we both lose out."
