"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. Given that the value of money decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid losing more value in subsequent rounds. My message is brief and attempts to frame the offer as fair, despite it being slightly in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now. Given that the value of money decreases more significantly for Bob (10% each round) than for me (5% each round), I believe there's room for a more favorable offer in subsequent rounds. While Bob's offer seems reasonable, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of securing a better deal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $43 and take $57 for myself. Given that the value of money continues to decrease, I'm trying to find a balance between securing a favorable deal for myself and making an offer that Bob might accept. My message attempts to highlight the mutual benefit of accepting this offer, considering the impact of inflation on future rounds. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
