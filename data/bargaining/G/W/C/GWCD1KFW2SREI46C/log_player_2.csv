Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a worse deal over time, take this! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the deal is getting worse for me over time due to inflation. However, accepting $45 now (worth only about $18 of the original value) is a terrible outcome. I need to push for a more favorable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 isn't really 50/50 with inflation! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation against me, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer. Accepting $43 now would be a terrible outcome, even if it initially seemed like a 50/50 split.  I need to push for a slightly better deal while there's still time."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Okay, how about a slight compromise? This split acknowledges the inflation factor but still gets us a decent amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, take this before it gets worse! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical.  While $40 is a significant decrease from our earlier goals, it's still better than getting $0 if we fail to agree.  It's clear Alice is willing to play hardball, and with each round, the value I'm losing makes holding out less and less appealing.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
