"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not giving away all the cash.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm trying to be generous, but I'm not giving away too much."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so the actual amount I'd get is $855,000 (90% of $950,000).

Bob's offer is to split the money, which is a fair proposal. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more this time!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'd get is $770,380 (77.38% of $1,000,000).

Bob's offer is to give me $200,000 and take $800,000 for himself. This is a very aggressive offer, and I'm not sure if I should take it. However, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting older, I might need to consider accepting a lower offer to get some cash out of this deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer, hoping to get some cash out of this deal, even if it's not the best deal I could have gotten."
