"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 4:1, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively small offer to Bob, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a better deal than 4:1. Let's try 2:1. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'm not thrilled with the 2:1 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit steep, but I'm willing to go up to 1.5:1. Can you meet me there?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more value out of the deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is starting to take its toll!

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced deal, but I'm not getting any younger!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your 50/50 idea, but I still want a slightly better deal. Let's try 55:45. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now!

I'm not thrilled with the 55:45 ratio, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too close to 60:40, but I'm willing to go up to 52:48. Can you meet me there?""
}
```

I'm trying to hold the line, but I'm not sure how much longer I can withstand the inflation!"

}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the current situation, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going!"
