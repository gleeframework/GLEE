"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rate.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I'm trying to make a fair offer to start with, considering the inflation rate that will affect my share over the next 12 rounds."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up that much more to Bob. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4,000 for me is still a bit low.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the inflation rate and Bob's previous offer."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
