"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is not in my best interest. I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was close, but I still deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. The pressure is on, but I still need to make a rational decision. Let's analyze:

* **Time:** 5 rounds remaining.
* **Inflation:** My gains are worth almost half of what they were originally.  
* **Alice's Offer:** While still skewed in her favor, it's getting closer to an even split.

Accepting would mean settling for less, but rejecting risks walking away with nothing if I misjudge Alice's strategy. 

**Decision:** This is a gamble, but I think I can still pressure her for a better deal in the remaining rounds.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer - take it before inflation eats up even more of the pie!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slight concession here to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm holding a firm line. The message emphasizes the time pressure and the shrinking pot due to inflation. Hopefully, this pushes Alice to accept before we both lose out."
