"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding...

Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'll consider the actual values I'll be getting.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $6000, which is equivalent to 80% of $7500 (the value of $6000 in the previous round).

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
