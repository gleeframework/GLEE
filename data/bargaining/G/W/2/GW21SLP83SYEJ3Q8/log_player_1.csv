Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a risky move, but I believe it's the best strategy to start with.  I'm giving Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting half of the money, and while it's less than what I wanted initially, it's still better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
