"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a bit more this time. After all, you rejected my offer, so I'm assuming you're willing to negotiate.  Let's see if you're still feeling generous! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial rejection. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to fall for that. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm not willing to accept a worse deal. It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting all the pie, Bob! But I'm still willing to be generous.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more, but not too much, to see how Bob reacts."
