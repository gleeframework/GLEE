Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bigger cut, accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation and getting nothing."
