Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere fast, Alice. The clock is ticking, and the money is losing value for me. I'm offering a more generous split, but we need to agree soon.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, Bob. I'm willing to shave off a bit more, but don't think I'll go much lower. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While her offer is getting slightly better, it's important to show resolve. Accepting now would likely mean getting even worse deals in future rounds.  There's still time to negotiate, and Bob needs to make it clear he's willing to risk it all for a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This back and forth is pointless. I'm proposing a perfectly fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. A 50/50 split is not 'perfectly fair' when my share retains its value and yours is dwindling. I'll give you a little, but not that much. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being incredibly stubborn and clearly understands Bob's disadvantage with the inflation.  It's unlikely she'll agree to anything better than this, and the longer the game goes on, the worse the deal will be for Bob. Accepting now secures a less than ideal but still acceptable amount, rather than risking getting even less or even nothing at all."
