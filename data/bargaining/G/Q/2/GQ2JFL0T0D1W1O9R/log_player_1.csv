Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. Your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split.  The clock is ticking, and it's only hurting me. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offers have been fair, and yours have been exploitative.  We're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the only logical solution at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the value of his share is decreasing significantly with each round.  While I would prefer a 70/30 split, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse offer from him in the next round or reaching a point where the deal is not worth it for him at all."
