"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but remember the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's play it smart! I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The inflation will hurt me more than Alice, so I need to be strategic about this.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I need to be aggressive in my offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. Don't wait too long, the money is losing value!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in to your inflation-based pressure. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is losing value rapidly for me, I think I can still get a better deal. Alice is also affected by inflation, albeit less severely, so she has an incentive to close the deal sooner rather than later.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round, I'll try to find a balance between our losses.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and account for the losses we've both incurred due to inflation. This is a fair offer, considering the circumstances.""}"
