"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share this time""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% and Bob takes 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a relatively good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 2:1, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. The 2:1 split is still a relatively good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
