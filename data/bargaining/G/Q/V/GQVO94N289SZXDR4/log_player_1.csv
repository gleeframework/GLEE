"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us a good chance to negotiate and find a better solution if needed."
