Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome considering the circumstances.  Let's close this out before the money loses even more value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:** The value of the money for Bob is decreasing rapidly (almost 50% less than its initial value).  This puts pressure on him to make a deal.
* **50/50 Split:**  While we'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split isn't terrible considering the circumstances. 
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** If we reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll offer anything close to this in subsequent rounds. The money will continue to devalue for him, making any potential offer less appealing. 

It's a gamble to push further. Accepting the current offer ensures a reasonable outcome."
