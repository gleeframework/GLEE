**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to the higher inflation she faces. While time is running out, accepting a deal where I receive less than 50% of the initial pot is not ideal. There's a good chance she'll make a better offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""We're running out of time! Let's just split it evenly and call it a day."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to get serious.  While I could push for a slightly larger share, the remaining time and increasing inflation make a 50/50 split the safest and most logical option. It guarantees a reasonable return and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
