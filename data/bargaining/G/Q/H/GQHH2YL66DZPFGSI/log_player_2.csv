"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept something, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round when it's my turn to decide."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have an equal say in this. What do you think?""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's go for a 60/40 split.  It's a better deal for you than the last round, and we can get this done before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split,  the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's a better deal than the previous round."
