Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. You rejected my initial offer, and now the total value has decreased due to inflation.  This is my final offer.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the increasing effect of inflation on your gains, I believe this split is now more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming severe. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer will likely result in even less favorable offers. Accepting now secures me a reasonable portion of the original amount."
