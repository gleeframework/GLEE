"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 5000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
