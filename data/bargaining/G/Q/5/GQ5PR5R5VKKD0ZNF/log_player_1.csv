Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous, hoping Bob will accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28} 
```

I'm going to decrease my share a bit, but still offer a relatively large portion to hopefully incentivize Bob to accept before the inflation hits harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's better than getting nothing in the later rounds, especially since I don't know how the inflation is impacting Bob's decisions."
