Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure a large share while leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. My share is significantly lower than my initial proposal, but it's still a decent amount.  With each passing round, my gains will diminish further due to inflation. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
