"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both walk away with a nice sum!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid risking a worse deal in future rounds."

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, but still a significant amount.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! The value of the money is dropping fast!""

}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $550,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly."
