"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and efficient, Bob. I take a bit more to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a large sum like $480,000, it's important to remember that this is only the first round.  We have 12 rounds and the money is depreciating with each round.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself later in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's flip the script this round, I'll take a slightly larger share to get things rolling.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats our money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
We've gone through two rounds and haven't reached an agreement.  Inflation is real, and it's starting to bite.  While I would love to keep negotiating, accepting a 50/50 split is the most rational choice to ensure we both get a substantial amount before the money shrinks further."
