Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is framing this as a compromise, she's still getting a larger share even with the inflation working against her.  Time is running out, but accepting a deal where I consistently get the worse end isn't smart. I need to push for a more favorable split, or at least something closer to even."
