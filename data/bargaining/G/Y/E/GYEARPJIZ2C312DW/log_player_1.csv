This offer is getting worse for me with each round! I need to incentivize Bob to accept a deal soon, or we both lose."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, given the accelerating devaluation of your share due to inflation, this offer is more than reasonable. It's time to settle. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I'm starting to get very concerned about the rapid devaluation.  While not ideal, taking Bob's offer ensures I get something before inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
