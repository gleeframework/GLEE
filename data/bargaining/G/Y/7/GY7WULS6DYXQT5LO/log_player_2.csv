Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, but with the inflation rate, my share is decreasing quickly. Let's find a compromise.  I'll accept 40, and you can have 60. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
