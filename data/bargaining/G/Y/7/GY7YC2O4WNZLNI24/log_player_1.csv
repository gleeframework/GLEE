I'm offering Bob a small share (100,000$) to start the game. I hope he'll accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, accepting this offer is the best outcome for me.  My share is significantly less than Bob's, but it's still better than getting nothing.  I'll adjust my offer in the future to try to get more, but for now, it's best to secure something."
