"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering a slightly unfair split. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, knowing that with each passing round, the value of the money will decrease for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's risky, but I'm going to reject this offer. I'm hoping that Bob will be more reasonable in the next round, knowing that the money is losing value with every passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 80/20. I'm still hoping to get a larger share, but I'm trying to be more reasonable to avoid further rounds of negotiation.  The inflation is a major factor in my decision making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is getting risky, but I'm still going to reject. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the value of the money is rapidly decreasing and be willing to negotiate a more even split soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm making another concession here, bringing my offer up to 65/35.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the declining value of the money and will be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  We're getting closer to a reasonable split, but I'm going to continue to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is taking its toll, but I'm confident we can reach a fair outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  We've both been stubborn so far, and the inflation is making it clear that we need to come to an agreement soon. It's time to compromise."
