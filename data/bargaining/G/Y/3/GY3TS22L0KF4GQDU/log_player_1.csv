"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 70/30 in favor of Alice. This seems fair given the potential inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think 70/30 is a bit too skewed. Let's try 80/20 instead. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
