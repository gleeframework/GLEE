It's tempting to take the equal split, but I'm curious how Alice might react to me taking a slightly larger share. I want to see if she's willing to negotiate or if she's set on that equal split."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better for me than my previous offer, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The inflation is affecting her more than me, so I'm going to try to leverage that to get a larger share."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though I'm gaining more than in the previous round, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to continue to push for a larger share while the inflation is impacting Alice more severely."

# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting desperate, but I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to try to push for an even larger share.  I'm confident I can get more than 5500 with the inflation hitting her so hard."

# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and while I'd love to keep pushing for more, I think it's a good time to accept this offer. I'm getting a decent share, and there's a risk that she might not accept any offer in the next round, leaving us both with nothing."
