"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me $60 and Bob $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent deal, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $30 is worth 20% less than my original gain of $60, so it's actually worth $24.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a decent deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
