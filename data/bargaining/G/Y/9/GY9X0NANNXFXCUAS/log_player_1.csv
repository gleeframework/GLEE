I'm going to start by being generous with Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy! I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to stick with a generous offer, but lower it a bit.  I hope Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before things get too complicated.  We're both losing money with every round."
