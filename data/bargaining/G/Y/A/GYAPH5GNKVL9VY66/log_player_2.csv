"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation impact on me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. With 11 rounds to go, I'm hoping to get a better deal. The 10% inflation rate per round is significant, but I think I can get a more even split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor, considering the inflation impact on both of us. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects you more, but I need a bit more security. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the inflation is taking its toll, Alice's offer is still not close to what I'm looking for. With 9 rounds to go, I'm willing to take the risk to try and get a better deal. The gap between our proposals is still quite large, so I'll wait for a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on both of us. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the growing inflation impact, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. A 52-48 split seems fair at this point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer gives us both a reasonable share considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although time is of the essence and inflation is significantly impacting my potential gain, Alice's offer still doesn't meet my expectations. With 7 rounds to go, I'm willing to push for a better deal. The difference in inflation impact between us is substantial, and I believe there's room for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, considering the growing urgency and the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial inflation impact on me, I think an even split is the fairest option at this point. It's time for us to meet in the middle and secure our shares.""}"
