"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""A fair and reasonable starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $40 and Bob receives $60. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to kick off the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm hoping he'll be more open to a compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
