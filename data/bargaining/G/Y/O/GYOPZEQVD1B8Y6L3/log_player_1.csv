I'm going to offer Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the one I offered him. I'm confident I can get a better deal, even with inflation.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not ideal for me.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm confident I can get more than 280,000."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to lower my offer a bit more, but I'm still offering Bob a good chunk of the money. With the inflation hitting him harder than me, I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept before the next round."

# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better for me, but I'm still holding out for a higher percentage. With each round, the inflation is hurting him more than me, so I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Even though it's not ideal, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is starting to really hurt Bob, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round. It's time to take what I can get and end this game."
