I propose to take 9000 dollars and give Bob 1000 dollars. This way, I get the majority, but still leave some for Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 8000, and increasing Bob's to 2000.  While inflation hurts my gains, I still believe this is a fair offer that gives Bob a significant increase from the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is still offering me a very small share, and his offer is likely to decrease further with each round due to inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to lower my share further to 7000, while giving Bob 3000. This reflects the increasing inflation, but I believe this is still a reasonable offer that gives Bob a significant increase from the previous round.  It's crucial to find a balance that allows both of us to get something before inflation erodes all of our potential gains."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to risk losing more money due to inflation, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 6000 and increasing Bob's to 4000. While inflation is impacting our potential gains significantly, I still believe a fair compromise is possible. This offer gives Bob a more substantial share compared to the previous round, while also ensuring I secure a reasonable amount given the current circumstances. We need to find a middle ground before inflation eliminates any potential gains."
