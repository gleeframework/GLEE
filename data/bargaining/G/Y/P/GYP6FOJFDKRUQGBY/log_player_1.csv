"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair offer considering we're trying to divide the money in a way that we both get a significant share. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to continue with Bob's response or if you'd like to simulate a different scenario!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will hurt us both if we keep going. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less in this round, Bob's offer of $4500 for me is actually equivalent to $4050 in the first round. Considering I initially offered Bob $4000, this is a relatively minor concession on his part. However, the fact that Bob is trying to negotiate and end the game quickly suggests that he may be willing to compromise further.\n\nGiven that the money will continue to lose value in subsequent rounds, I'll reject this offer in the hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since Bob offered me $4500 in the previous round, I'll offer him a slightly larger share while still trying to maximize my own gain.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness, while also being mindful of the fact that the money is worth 20% less than it was in the first round. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, rather than risking further losses due to inflation.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
