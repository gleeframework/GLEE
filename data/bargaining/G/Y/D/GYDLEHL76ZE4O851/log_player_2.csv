"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think 62-38 is a reasonable adjustment

# Alice gain: 62

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the significant inflation, I think 65-35 is a more realistic split 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, accepting a deal where I get 35% of the original value is a terrible outcome.  It's time to show I'm serious and willing to risk it all.  If we reach round 6, I'll be forced to accept a very unfavorable deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - 60/40.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes gamble. Here's why I'm choosing this strategy:

* **Time Pressure:**  This is the last round where I can make an offer. If Alice rejects this, I'll be in a severely weakened position in round 7 due to inflation. 
* **Demonstrating Seriousness:**  Alice needs to understand I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a reasonable deal. This offer, while still favoring me, shows I'm somewhat flexible from my previous 50/50 stance.
* **Potential for Alice to Accept:** There's a chance Alice will see this as the best she'll get, especially if she's been assuming I'd fold under the pressure of inflation. 

It's a risky move, but at this point, a strong play is necessary."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the extreme inflation, I think 70-30 is a more realistic split. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

I have no choice.  

Alice knows I'm at her mercy now.  If I reject this offer, the inflation will hurt me even more next round. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but taking 30% now is better than getting even less in Round 8."
