# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI want to see if I can get a better offer in the next round, considering the inflation rate is higher for Alice. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You still get the bigger share, but I need to account for the value decrease over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer accounts for inflation while still giving us both a significant sum. We need to find a compromise soon. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, Alice's offer doesn't seem significantly better than before, considering the overall decrease in value for both of us. I believe there's room for further negotiation to find a more balanced split. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your share, I'm trying to find a middle ground that considers the devaluing of the money over time. This offer aims to balance our gains more fairly under the current circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, it's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, especially on Alice's, and the fact that we're running out of rounds, I believe this offer is the most reasonable compromise we can reach. The difference in our shares is still notable, but given the devaluation of money and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't agree soon, I find this offer acceptable. Let's conclude the game with this division."
