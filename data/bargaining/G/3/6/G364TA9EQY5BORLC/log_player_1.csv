I'll start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I'll take 999,000 and give Bob 1,000.  This gives me the most possible in the first round, while still offering him something to think about.  We'll see if he bites."

Bob is basically offering me the same amount as my last offer. The inflation has really hit him hard, and I'm not going to risk losing everything. It's time to take what I can get."
