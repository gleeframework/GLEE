I'm Bob, and I'm going to be strategic! Even though it's a small amount, I know I can do better. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair starting point and avoids the risk of inflation eating into our gains."" 
}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still the one making the proposal, so I'll take a bigger share.  Accept this and we can avoid more inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even though inflation is hitting my gains, I'm confident I can get closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer.  This is a fair compromise given the risk of further inflation, and we should reach an agreement before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is seriously hurting my gains. While I still believe in a more equal split, at this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer and avoid further losses. I'll need to be more strategic in future negotiations."
