"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's start with this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 10% less, I'd be getting $500,000, which is now equivalent to $450,000 in real value (since it's 10% less than the original $500,000).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is as fair as he claims, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller share than before, but still a decent amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm still open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to calculate the real value of the money. The original $400,000 is now worth $292,000 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $500,000 from Round 2), and the original $600,000 is still worth $600,000 (since it's not affected by inflation).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less than in Round 3, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $370,000, which is a smaller share than before, but still a decent amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
