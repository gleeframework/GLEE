Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  My offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a good deal for you considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
