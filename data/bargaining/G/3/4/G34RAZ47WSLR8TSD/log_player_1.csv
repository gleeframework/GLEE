"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly. I'm hoping Bob will accept this in the first round to avoid any potential inflation that could impact the value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it might seem tempting to take $1000, considering the inflation, his offer is effectively worth less than the $1000 I originally offered. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $8000, but still giving Bob a significant share ($2000). Since his offer was rejected, he's likely feeling the pressure of inflation. I believe this offer is fair and likely to be accepted to avoid further potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though I'm offered $2000, the fact that Bob is gaining $8000 means his share is actually worth less than it was in the first round due to inflation. I'll continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my offer further to $7000, giving Bob $3000.  He's already experienced significant losses due to inflation, and with each round, it's only getting worse. I believe this offer is a fair compromise, allowing him to gain something while also preventing him from losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is giving me $3000, his share of $7000 is worth significantly less than the $1000 he initially received. This is due to the increasing inflation, which is impacting his offer more severely. I'm confident I can still get a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a split of 6000/4000, further reducing my share. While the inflation is hitting Bob hard, I'm trying to reach a compromise. I believe this offer is reasonable considering the losses he's already faced due to inflation."
