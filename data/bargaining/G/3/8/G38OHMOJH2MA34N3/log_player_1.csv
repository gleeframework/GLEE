I propose that I take 900,000 and Bob takes 100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given that the money depreciates at a faster rate for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to try to get closer to a 50/50 split, but I need to offer him more to make it worth his while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a more balanced split, and Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable as inflation takes its toll. I'll try to make a counter-offer that's more appealing to both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is still a significant share, but I need to secure a larger portion for myself to make the offer worthwhile, considering the escalating inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still prefer a more even split, the inflation is making the situation increasingly difficult.  This is close to a 50/50 split, and accepting it is the best way to secure something for myself."
