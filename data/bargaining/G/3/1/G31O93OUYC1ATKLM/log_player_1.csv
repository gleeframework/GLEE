"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'll make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm adjusting the ratio to favor myself slightly, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'll make my next proposal, trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of Bob's offer due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm increasing the ratio even more, taking a larger share of the money. With inflation eating away at Bob's potential gains, I'm trying to capitalize on the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to go back to a 50-50 split, but with the value of his share being significantly lower due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make another proposal. The fact that Bob is reverting to a 50-50 split suggests he's getting desperate, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm taking a very aggressive stance, offering Bob a relatively small share of the money. With inflation eating away at his potential gains, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to salvage what's left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to hold on to a decent share of the money, but the value of his offer is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I think it's better to settle for this offer rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
