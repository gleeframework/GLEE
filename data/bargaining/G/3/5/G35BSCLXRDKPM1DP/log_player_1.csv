"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good starting point for negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to negotiate.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give away too much yet!""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a 55/45 split, while still holding onto a decent chunk of the money. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
