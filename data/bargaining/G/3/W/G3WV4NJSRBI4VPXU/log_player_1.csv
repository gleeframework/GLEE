"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in the first round was 60% to me and 40% to Bob, and Bob's offer in the second round is 50% to each. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think my offer is still a better deal for me.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in the second round was 50% to each, and the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll aim to keep a slightly higher percentage for myself to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the offer. The money is worth 0% less for me, so my gain of $5500 is still $5500. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so it's actually worth $6000 / (1 - 0.488) = $6000 / 0.512 = $11703.13 in the first round's value. However, since we are in the 4th round, the money is worth 0.512^3 = 0.262144 of the original value. So, Bob's gain is actually worth $11703.13 * 0.262144 = $3069.38 in the 4th round's value. My gain is still $5500.

Since my gain is still higher than Bob's gain in the 4th round, I'll accept the offer.
