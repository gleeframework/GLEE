"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make an initial offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'll get $4,500, which is 45% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get $5,500, which is 55% of the current value, I'll accept the offer.
