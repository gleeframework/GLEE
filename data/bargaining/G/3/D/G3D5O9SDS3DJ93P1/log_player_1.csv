I'm taking almost all the money. It's my turn, and I'm not worried about Bob getting a fair share right now. Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept. Even though I'm getting a very small share, it's better than nothing. The inflation will make Bob's offer less and less appealing in the future, so it's better to take what I can get now."
