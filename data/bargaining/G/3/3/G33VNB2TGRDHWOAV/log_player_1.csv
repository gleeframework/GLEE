I'm going for a very aggressive opening move. I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with a tiny sliver.  This is risky, but if Bob rejects it, the money will lose value faster for him than for me, giving me a better chance in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting significantly less than I initially wanted, the inflation is already hitting hard, and I'm better off taking what I can get now before it's worth even less."
