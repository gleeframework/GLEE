Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on only hurts us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we get the most out of this deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
