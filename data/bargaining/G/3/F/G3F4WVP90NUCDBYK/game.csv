60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us both a good deal right from the start.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about a 55/45 split? It's a good deal before inflation eats into our profits.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"I'm sticking with my previous offer. Time is ticking, and we're both losing money due to inflation. It's a fair deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. This is the last round where a 50/50 split is even remotely fair.  Any longer and inflation will demand a better deal for me.  Do you want to make a deal or keep playing chicken?",Bob,4,
