Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think a more balanced split is fairer considering the inflation rates. This offer still gives you a good share, while allowing me to keep more for myself. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
