This offer is not acceptable. While I understand the inflation is impacting us both, it's still too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a fairer split."

This offer is completely unacceptable. While the inflation is hurting me significantly, I still refuse to accept such an unfair division. We're running out of time, but I'm holding out for a more reasonable split."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Given the rapid inflation and the shrinking time, I believe an even split is the only way to reach a deal. It's a compromise, but it's the best way to ensure we both get something."
