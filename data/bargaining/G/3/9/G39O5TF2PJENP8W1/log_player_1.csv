Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
