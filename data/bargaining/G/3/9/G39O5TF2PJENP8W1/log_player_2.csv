Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's split it 60/40,  with me taking 60%.  This is a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
