"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose a split of 95 dollars for me and 5 dollars for Bob. This is a good starting point, and since the value of money might decrease, I want to secure a larger share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid getting nothing.  85 for me and 15 for Bob seems like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, and I need to secure at least some money. I'm dropping my offer to 75 for me and 25 for Bob. This seems like a fair compromise considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 30 dollars is better than nothing, Bob's offer is still very unequal, and I'm not convinced I can't get more. I'm going to continue pushing for a fairer split, even though the clock is ticking."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again to 60 for me and 40 for Bob. Time is getting tight, and I need to make a concession, but I'm still hoping for a more equitable split."
