"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but it's important to be assertive early on. Since Bob has no information about how the inflation affects him, he might accept a small amount to avoid risking getting nothing at all. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer slightly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very fair offer, but I'm going to reject it. I know that the inflation affects Bob negatively, and he's likely to offer me more than 500,000 in the following rounds to avoid getting nothing.  I'm willing to risk it and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to make a slightly more generous offer than in round 1, but I still want the majority of the money. Bob knows he's losing value with each round, and I think he'll be tempted to accept this offer rather than risk losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more favorable to me as the rounds progress. I'm confident that he's feeling the pressure of inflation, and he's willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing. I'm going to accept this offer and secure a substantial amount of money."
