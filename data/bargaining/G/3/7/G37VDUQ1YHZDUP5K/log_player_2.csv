"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a terrible deal for Bob! Even though the money loses value for Alice,  it's better for Bob to reject and see if he can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 999000,
""alice_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous too. ðŸ˜‰ This is a fair deal, considering the inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not a great deal for Bob, it's much better than the previous round. In the next round, the money will be worth less to Alice, and she may offer even less. It's time to take the deal and end the game."
