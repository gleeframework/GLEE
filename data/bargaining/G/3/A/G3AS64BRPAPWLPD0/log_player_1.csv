"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer means I get $5,000, which is better than nothing. The inflation is a serious factor, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all by rejecting."
