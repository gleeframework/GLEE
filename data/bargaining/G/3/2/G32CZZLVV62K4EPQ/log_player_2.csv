Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a waiting game, knowing Bob's value decreases each round. However, accepting $4,300 now is better than potentially getting zero if we can't agree later. I'm hoping this continued rejection will push Alice to be more reasonable in the next round. There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this drags on.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I need to signal that I'm serious and won't accept a bad deal just because time is running out.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $4,800 is a slight increase from Alice's $4,300, showing some willingness to compromise. 
* **Framing:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add weight to the decision and push Alice towards accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows time is on her side. While $3,800 is significantly less than what I aimed for, rejecting this offer carries a massive risk.  

Here's why accepting is the less risky option:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the value will diminish significantly with each rejection.  
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice's offers have been getting worse, not better. There's a real chance she'll offer even less next round.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If we don't agree, we both get $0. 

It's painful, but accepting now guarantees some reward, while rejecting risks getting nothing at all."
