"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a bit more evenly, Alice. How about 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6300,
""bob_gain"": 3700,
""message"": ""I need a better deal than that, Bob. Time is money, but so is fairness.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair in principle, the inflation is working heavily in my favor. Bob is losing value much faster than I am. Holding out for a better offer, even as the total amount decreases, is still the best strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm being more than fair considering how much value you're losing each round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm losing money faster.  This is my final offer for a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is right, he is losing value significantly faster than I am. While this isn't the 60/40 split I initially aimed for, accepting a 52/48 split at this point guarantees me a decent amount of the money.  Continuing to hold out risks ending up with nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
