"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, as it allows for a significant gain for me while still giving Bob something. I'm confident that he will accept this offer and we can both walk away with a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I initially proposed a more favorable split for myself, I understand that Bob rejected it. Accepting this 50/50 split ensures I get a significant amount of money, even with the inflation. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
