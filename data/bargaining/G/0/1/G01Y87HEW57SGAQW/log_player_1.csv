Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money's value has decreased for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob emphasized fairness and equity in his message, I'll try to appeal to that in my next proposal, considering the inflation factor.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome.\n\n###\n\nMy turn again! Here's my next offer:\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $420,000 and keep $580,000 for myself, taking into account the 20% devaluation of the money for me. My message will highlight this adjustment to persuade Bob that the offer is fair under the current circumstances.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in the money's value for me due to inflation (48.8% less than the initial value), I believe this offer is reasonable. Bob's message emphasizes that time is running out, and I agree that prolonging the game further would only reduce my potential gain. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, even if it's less than my initial proposals. The deal seems fair under the current circumstances, so I'll conclude the game here.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome."
