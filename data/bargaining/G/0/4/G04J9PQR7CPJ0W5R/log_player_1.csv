"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $3000, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less money.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
