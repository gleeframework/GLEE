Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's split it down the middle. I'm not willing to go lower than 50%, and I think this is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower than a 50/50 split.  Accepting now ensures I get a reasonable amount, and avoids the risk of further inflation eating into Alice's share (and making her less likely to offer a fair deal later).
