I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to take it and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing any more money to inflation.  Let's end this game."
