450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better for both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a substantial share, but it also reflects the value of my time and effort. Let's work together to get the most out of this deal.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time and both benefit from this.  I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, simple, and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
