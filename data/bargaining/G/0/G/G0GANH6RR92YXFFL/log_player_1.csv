Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to take a small share right away, or if he'll try to negotiate for more.  Since I'm the one proposing, I'll take the lion's share.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take the $10,  it's important to remember that inflation means the money I gain is now worth less than it was in the first round.  I'm willing to take a smaller share than my initial offer, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with significantly less than I had before.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still aim for a larger share. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me significantly less than my initial offer."
