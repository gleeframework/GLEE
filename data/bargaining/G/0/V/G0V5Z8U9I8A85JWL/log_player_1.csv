Let's see if Bob is greedy!  I'll keep the lion's share and give him just a dollar, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to accept the offer now. While I'm losing out on 499,999 dollars,  I'm guaranteed to get something. It's risky to reject and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round, especially considering the inflation factor."
