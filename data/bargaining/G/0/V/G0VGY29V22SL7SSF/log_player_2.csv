Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's make a deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are inching closer to a more even split, but time is on my side. The inflation is eroding her potential gains faster than mine.  I need to keep applying pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most logical choice now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is catching on to the fact that I'm leveraging the inflation. Offering an even split now makes it seem like a concession on my part,  increasing the likelihood she'll accept before her potential gains diminish further."
