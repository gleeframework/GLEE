I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave 100,000 dollars for Bob. This leaves a fair amount for Bob, and since I'm the one proposing, I'm going to keep the majority.  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I'm getting 100,000, it's only worth 95% of what it was worth in the first round due to inflation.  I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to try a more even split this time.  I'll take 450,000, and offer Bob 550,000.  This is still a good deal for me since I'm the one proposing, and it should be enticing enough for Bob given that he's been losing more value due to inflation."
