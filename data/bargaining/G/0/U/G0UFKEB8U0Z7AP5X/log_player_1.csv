Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This seems like a fair starting offer. It gives Bob a small amount to make him feel included, while I get a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it is true that the money is worth less than in the previous round, I still have more bargaining power.  I will likely get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a majority of the money.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation."
