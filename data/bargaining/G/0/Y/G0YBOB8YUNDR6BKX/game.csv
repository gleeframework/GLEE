6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  Hopefully we can reach a deal quickly before the money inflates away!,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can find a better deal from here.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, I see your point about 50/50 being fair.  Let's split the difference.  I'll take 55%, you take 45%.  Let's get this done before we lose too much more money!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,I'm still not comfortable with the 55/45 split. I'll meet you halfway between 50/50 and your original 60/40 offer. 52/48 seems like a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make a deal.,Bob,4,
