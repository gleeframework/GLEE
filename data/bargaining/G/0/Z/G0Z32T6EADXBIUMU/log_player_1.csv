Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round, even though there's a chance the money will inflate significantly in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to keep more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially considering the inflation factor.  It's unlikely that I'll get a better deal in the next round."
