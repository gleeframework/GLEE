Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** While the offer is slightly less than the initial 400,000, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money. My gains are worth 36% less than round 1, meaning I'm effectively getting less than 250,000 in today's value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a significant risk that Alice will propose an even worse offer for me in the next round. Accepting this ensures I get something, even if it's less than I'd initially like."
