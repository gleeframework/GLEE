Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking advantage of the inflation for the moment. I propose a more even split, but with a slight advantage for me. This is a fair trade for your previous offer, considering the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
