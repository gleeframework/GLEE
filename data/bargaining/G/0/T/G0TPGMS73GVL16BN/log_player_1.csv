"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and let's negotiate from here.""
}

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the decrease in value, I'd rather not accept an offer that's still quite skewed towards Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
