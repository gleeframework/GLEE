Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, I can wait 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wait me out, hoping I'll panic as the value decreases. However, her own share is decreasing at more than twice the rate of mine. While the offer isn't terrible, I need to show firmness to get a better deal in the next few rounds."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value too, don't forget 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, I'm losing value too. While not ideal, this offer is now better than my previous offer will be to her in the next round due to inflation.  It's getting risky to keep pushing."
