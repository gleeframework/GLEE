"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less, I'll get more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With Bob's offer, I'll get $300,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial $500,000. On the other hand, Bob will get $700,000, which is a substantial increase from the initial $500,000.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""A slightly tilted split, but still fair!""}

I'm proposing a split where I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000. This is a slightly more favorable split for Bob, but I still think it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get peanuts, I'll get the feast! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm already feeling the pinch. His offer of $150,000 for me is extremely low, and I'm not thrilled about it.

However, I'm also aware that if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing if we reach the 12th round and the money is worth even less. So, I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
