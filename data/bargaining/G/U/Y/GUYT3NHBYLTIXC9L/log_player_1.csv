"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair and balanced start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair this time. I'll take a bit more, but we'll both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 40% is a decent share for me, considering I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
