"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$ and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a bit better, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

In this round, my gain of 55 is worth 90% of the original 70 (since 10% was lost to inflation in the first round). That's equivalent to 63 in the original terms.

Bob's gain of 45 is worth 95% of the original 30 (since 5% was lost to inflation in the first round). That's equivalent to 28.5 in the original terms.

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counteroffer: 60 for me, 40 for you. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, my gain of 60 is worth 90% of the original 63 (since 10% was lost to inflation in the second round). That's equivalent to 56.7 in the original terms.

Bob's gain of 40 is worth 95% of the original 28.5 (since 5% was lost to inflation in the second round). That's equivalent to 27 in the original terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in the original terms.

My gain of 48 is worth 63.33% of the original 70 (since 36.67% was lost to inflation in the first round, and then 27.1% in the second round, and 10% in the third round). That's equivalent to 44.33 in the original terms.

Bob's gain of 52 is worth 76.67% of the original 30 (since 23.33% was lost to inflation in the first round, and then 5% in the second round, and 14.26% in the third round). That's equivalent to 22.8 in the original terms.

Considering this, I think I can still do better. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counteroffer: 50 for me, 50 for you. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the fourth round, my gain of 50 is worth 90.9% of the original 44.33 (since 9.1% was lost to inflation in the fourth round). That's equivalent to 40.0 in the original terms.

However, since I made a counteroffer, I'll keep the same gain of 50.

Bob's gain of 50 is worth 95.4% of the original 22.8 (since 4.6% was lost to inflation in the fourth round). That's equivalent to 21.7 in the original terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
