"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting less than half of the original value. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation again. The money is now worth 20% less for me compared to the first round (10% less in the second round, and another 10% less in this round).\n\nConsidering this, I'll make an offer that might seem a bit more generous to Bob, but still tries to maximize my gain considering the loss of value.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\nYour turn!"
