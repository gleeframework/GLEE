"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, I'm the best negotiator!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. It's fair and just. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'll calculate my gain in the current round:

$20 / (0.95) = $21.05

So, I would gain $21.05 if I accept the offer.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

My gain in this round would be worth 5% less than $21.05, so:

$21.05 / (0.95) = $22.11

I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, considering the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob!""
}
```"
