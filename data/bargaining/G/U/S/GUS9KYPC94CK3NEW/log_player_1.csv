Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he might accept it in the first round. I'm not sure how inflation will affect him, so I'm being cautious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more, given the inflation, the 7500 offer is much better than what I would get if I rejected and then made a counteroffer.  I also don't know if Bob is affected by the inflation, so I might be better off accepting."
