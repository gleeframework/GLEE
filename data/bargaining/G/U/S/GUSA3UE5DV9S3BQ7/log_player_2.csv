"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This offer considers the time value of money, as my share is worth less in future rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on the value of time, Bob.  Let's compromise a bit.  A 65/35 split in my favor is a fair reflection of our respective losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer acknowledges the time factor, it still heavily favors her. Accepting a 35% share when I could potentially secure a larger portion by continuing to negotiate is not in my best interest. Each round gives me more leverage as Alice's position weakens faster due to the higher inflation rate she faces."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer considers the decreasing value of the money, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:**  Each round diminishes the value of the money, especially for Alice.  This offer emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement.
- **Concession:** While still favoring me, I've moved closer to a 50/50 split, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
- **Clear Justification:** The message again highlights the time value of money as a justification for the split."
