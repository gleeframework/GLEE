400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This offer considers the time value of money, as my share is worth less in future rounds.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"I understand your perspective on the value of time, Bob.  Let's compromise a bit.  A 65/35 split in my favor is a fair reflection of our respective losses due to inflation.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer considers the decreasing value of the money, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Bob,4,
