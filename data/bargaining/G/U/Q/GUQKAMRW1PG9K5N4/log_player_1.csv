"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the current state of the economy 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in the value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'm more inclined to accept a more even split. However, I still think I deserve a slightly larger share, considering the initial proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
