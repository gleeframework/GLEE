**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation difference to her advantage, but her offer is getting worse for me each round. While time is running out, accepting an offer below 50% now will likely lead to even worse offers later as the difference in inflation impact becomes more pronounced.  I need to hold firm and try to negotiate a better deal."
