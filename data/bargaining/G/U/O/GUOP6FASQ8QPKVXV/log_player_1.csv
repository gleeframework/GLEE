"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money I gain due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a lower share. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
