"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a larger share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to me, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the significant difference in the value of the money between us, I think I should take this offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.
