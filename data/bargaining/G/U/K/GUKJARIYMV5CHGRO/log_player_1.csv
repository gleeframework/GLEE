"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm hoping he'll take it, but I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation is a serious threat. It's better to get something than nothing."
