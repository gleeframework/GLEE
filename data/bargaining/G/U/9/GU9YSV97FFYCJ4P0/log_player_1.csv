"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I'm the first to propose and can take advantage of the initial value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I prefer a 55/45 split, it's better to secure 40% of the money now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
