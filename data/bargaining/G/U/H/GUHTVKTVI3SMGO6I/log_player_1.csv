"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be fair!"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer.\n\nYour turn! What's Bob's response?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This is better for both of us than waiting longer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I offered Bob $40 in the first round and he rejected it, now he's offering me $45. Considering the inflation, $45 in this round is actually worth less than $45 in the first round. However, it's still a better offer than what I initially proposed to him. Given that inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money in subsequent rounds, I think accepting this offer is the best decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
