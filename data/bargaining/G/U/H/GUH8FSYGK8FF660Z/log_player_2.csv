"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see what Alice will offer next, especially with the inflation rates in play.  Let's see how this affects her proposals."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair division, considering the inflation rates. We both get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic. Time is running out for you, and the money keeps shrinking. This offer is still decent for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not convinced. While Alice is right that time is running out, the inflation rate is significantly hurting me more than it is her. I need to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's make a deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than the last offer. This is a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation.""}
