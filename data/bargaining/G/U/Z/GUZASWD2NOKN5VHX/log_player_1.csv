"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm starting off with a generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer. While the inflation makes the money worth less, I can still do better than this by negotiating. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll offer a slightly better split for Bob than his last offer. Hopefully, he'll accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with this offer, even with the inflation factor. I'll reject and try to improve the split for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll try to compromise a bit more by offering a 80/20 split. It's still a decent share for me, and hopefully, Bob will accept it after his previous offer was rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, I need to be realistic. I've already rejected a few offers, and the money is quickly losing its value. Accepting this offer will secure at least some money, even if it's not ideal."
