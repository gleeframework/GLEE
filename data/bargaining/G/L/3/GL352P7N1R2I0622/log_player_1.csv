"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, and I'll take the remaining 80%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, Alice! Let's see if you'll accept this offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38 ($40 * 0.95) now.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... Hmm... 60% for Bob seems a bit steep, but I don't want to reject another offer and risk getting nothing.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
