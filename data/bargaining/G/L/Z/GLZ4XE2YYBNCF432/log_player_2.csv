"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a small token of my generosity.  Accept and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
