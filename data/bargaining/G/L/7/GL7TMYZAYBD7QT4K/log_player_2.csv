Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's split it 90/10.  But remember, the money depreciates faster for you, so this is a good deal for both of us.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 70/30.  We need to reach an agreement quickly before the value of the money drops too much! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is working against me more than her. It's still too risky to accept an offer where I get significantly less. I need to push for a more favorable outcome in the next round."
