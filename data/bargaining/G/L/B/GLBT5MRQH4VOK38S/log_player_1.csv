"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll get 70 * 0.8 = 56, and Bob will get 30 * 0.8 = 24.

I'll reject this offer, as I was hoping for a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50/50""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and balanced offer. Your turn, Bob!"
