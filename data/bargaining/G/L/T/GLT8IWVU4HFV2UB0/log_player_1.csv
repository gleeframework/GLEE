# Bob's message: Let's try a different split, closer to 50/50 but considering I'm losing less to inflation.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive, and while the offer isn't terrible considering the inflation, I need to hold out for a better deal. The longer this goes on, the more desperate Bob might become, giving me a chance to secure a more favorable split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be sensible. This offer still gives you a decent share, and it's better than waiting any longer with this inflation eating away at our potential gains.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I am meeting Bob slightly closer to the middle ground, but still aiming for a slight advantage given the faster inflation affecting my gains. This offer is designed to be tempting enough for him to accept, as the money is losing value quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get the larger share. Inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is getting close to my absolute bottom line, even considering the inflation. However, accepting now would give him a significant victory. There's still a chance he'll panic as the rounds progress and the total amount shrinks further. I'm willing to gamble on that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer and let's both walk away with something before it's too late.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking and the pot is shrinking fast.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I need to be realistic. This offer is a slight concession from my previous stance, aiming to entice Bob while still securing a reasonable share for myself before inflation eats away at everything."
