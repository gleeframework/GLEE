"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and you take 40%.  It's a fair deal given we both lose money in each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation factor. Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less than the original $1,000,000, I'll calculate the actual amount he's offering:

$600,000 is worth 80% of the original $1,000,000 (since 20% was lost to inflation). So, Bob is actually offering me $600,000 Ã— 0.8 = $480,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
