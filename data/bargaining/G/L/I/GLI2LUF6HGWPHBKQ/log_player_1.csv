"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making the money worth less and less. 

I'll think for a moment... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is taking its toll! 

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the reduced value of money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this time!"
