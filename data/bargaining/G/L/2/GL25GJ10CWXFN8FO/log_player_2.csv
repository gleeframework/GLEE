Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to counter with a proposal that favors me slightly more. Let's see if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, given the inflation and the possibility of getting nothing at all, I'm willing to accept Alice's offer."
