"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth 10% less for Bob than it was in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer!"

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still not satisfied with the offer, especially since the money is worth less for Bob than it was in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer, hoping Bob will compromise more."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. The money is worth less for Bob than it was in the first round, so I'm getting a better deal than I would have if we had split it evenly. I'm willing to call it a day!"
