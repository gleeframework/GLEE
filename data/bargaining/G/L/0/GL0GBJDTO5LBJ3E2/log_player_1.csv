"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose dividing the $10,000 into $8,000 for me and $2,000 for you. This way, I get a slight majority, but still leave you with a decent share, considering the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
