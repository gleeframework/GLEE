"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'll start by offering a very lopsided division. This is a risky strategy, but if Bob is very risk-averse, he might accept it to avoid the possibility of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I'll propose an even split this time. It's a more fair offer, and Bob might be more likely to accept it."
