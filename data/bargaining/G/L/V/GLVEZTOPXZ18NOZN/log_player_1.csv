This is a tough situation, but rejecting this offer is too risky. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round, my potential earnings decrease significantly. Accepting $40 now is better than risking an even worse offer in the next round.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems content to wait me out, knowing inflation works in his favor.  
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee I can get Bob to agree to a better deal, and waiting might leave me with an even smaller share. 

While not ideal, taking the $40 now cuts my losses and ends this unfavorable game."
