"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no hard feelings! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 5000 is actually worth 4,750 (5% less than 5000).

I'm not sure if I want to accept an even split, since I was hoping to get a bit more. But it's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk going to another round.
