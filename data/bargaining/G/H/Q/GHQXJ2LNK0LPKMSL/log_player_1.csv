"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is to see if he's willing to accept anything at all, or if he's going to be more competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $100,000, I know that Bob is clearly willing to be more competitive. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 900,000 for myself, while offering Bob 100,000. This is a more reasonable split than Bob's last offer, and I think it shows a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Bob's offers are getting worse and worse with each round, and while $200,000 is a lot of money, it's still much less than what I believe I can get. The next round is mine, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000.  This is a big drop from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable one given that Bob's offers have been decreasing. I'm hoping that he sees that we are both losing value with each round, and that we need to come to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. Although Bob is starting to be more reasonable, his offers are still far too low.  With only 6 rounds left, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000.  This is a compromise, giving him a larger share than my last offer, but still leaving me with a majority. It's a move towards finding a middle ground, especially with the time running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are steadily getting worse, and I'm not going to accept this one.  With only four rounds left, I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I'm starting to be more flexible. I'm hoping this offer is good enough to make Bob agree, as we're both losing money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept.  With only two rounds left, the value of the money is going to drop significantly. While I would prefer to have more than 500,000, I'm taking what I can get at this point.  I'm also gambling that Bob would be more likely to reject a counter-offer from me, since he is likely also feeling the pressure of time and decreasing value."
