"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one who makes the next offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, I'll have to think carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a larger share""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than his previous offer, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time, but I think I've been generous enough 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the huge gap in the split, but I need to think about the bigger picture. I'll have to accept this offer to avoid getting nothing.
