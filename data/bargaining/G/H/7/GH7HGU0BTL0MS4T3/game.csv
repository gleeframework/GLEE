,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I appreciate your generosity Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm offering you a small share this time, but if you reject this, the money will be worth even less for me in the next round, making it harder to agree on a fair split.",Bob,2,

850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm coming down significantly, but this is a fair deal considering the decreasing value for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to split this fairly, but we need to find a middle ground.  If you reject this, the inflation will continue to hurt us both, and we might not have a chance to get a good deal in the future.",Bob,4,

200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end, and we both stand to lose a lot. This offer is the best I can do considering the inflation. Let's settle this and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.",Bob,6,

250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm risking everything by rejecting your previous offer, so I need a good deal now.  Let's settle this before the inflation completely eats away our gains. This is your chance to get a decent share. ",Bob,8,
