8000.0,2000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to benefit from the division.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair and balanced offer that allows us both to walk away with a significant share of the money. Let's end this game on a positive note.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
