"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you the lion's share.  If you reject this offer, I'm confident I can do better in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
It's painful, but I have to reject. Alice is playing a tough game, but the potential losses from further inflation are too big to accept this offer.  I'm hoping she'll get more reasonable in Round 4 when it's her turn to face the devaluation."
