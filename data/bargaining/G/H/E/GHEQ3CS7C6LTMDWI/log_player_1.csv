"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, let's see if you'll accept! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give him 80% of the remaining amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to make up for the loss in value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, but still fair!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, considering the reduced value of the money."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not willing to accept such an unfavorable split. Bob's offer is too aggressive, and I'm not convinced he's willing to compromise.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

# Alice gain: 1

I'll reject this offer and try to make one last attempt to negotiate a better deal. If I don't get a good offer, I'll have to consider accepting something even worse.
