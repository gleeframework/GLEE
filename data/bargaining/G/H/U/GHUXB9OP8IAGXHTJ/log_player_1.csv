"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a bit more to start the negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share to account for potential future inflation, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. It's a relatively low share, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.
