"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair split and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a slightly larger share but we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a substantial amount for myself."
