"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself, suggesting a fair division to start the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I think this is more in line with the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, the division still seems too favorable to him, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\n###\nGiven the decreasing value of money, I propose a division that is more balanced, taking into account the losses due to inflation, and suggest meeting halfway to reach a mutually acceptable deal."
