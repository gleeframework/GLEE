"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to set a baseline for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take the majority, eh?

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to let you take the majority. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 ratio in favor of me this time, but I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to find a sweet spot, I see.

I'll accept this offer. It's a decent compromise, and I'm getting a larger share than I was in the previous round. I'll take 600,000 and call it a day.

```
