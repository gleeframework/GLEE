Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be a little greedy at first, but I'm hoping to find a balance that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer than my initial one, and I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation."
