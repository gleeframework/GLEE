90.0,10.0,"I'm offering you a fair deal, Bob. Let's split the money 90/10 in my favor. It's a good start, and I'm sure we can work out something more equitable in the future.",Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  We need to reach an agreement quickly because time is literally money for me in this game.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, I understand your need for a bigger share, but 70/30 is still too much. I'm willing to compromise and split it 45/55. Let's meet in the middle and avoid losing more money to inflation.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is literally evaporating with each round.  65/35 is my final offer.  Let's get this done.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, I'm sticking to my guns. Let's split this 40/60.  We're losing too much value to keep going back and forth. Let's both get something before it's too late.",Alice,5,
