600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's the first round and we both get the most value out of the money now.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Your 60-40 split seems a bit off, Alice. How about we go 55-45? It's still a good deal for you in the early rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"I see you're willing to negotiate, but 55-45 is not enough for me. How about we meet in the middle between my original offer and yours?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
530000.0,470000.0,"We're running out of time, Alice. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but it has to be a significant jump from your last offer. 53-47 is my compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I'm willing to make a smaller concession. This is my new offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's stop this dance. We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is eating away at the value. A 50-50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
