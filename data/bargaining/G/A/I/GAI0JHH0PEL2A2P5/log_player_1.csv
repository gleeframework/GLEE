Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, let's end it here! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so fast, Bob!

I'll reject your offer. I think I can do better than 40%.
