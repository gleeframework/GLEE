I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority, but I still offer Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a real concern. It's better to accept a 50/50 split now and secure at least half the money before the value diminishes further."
