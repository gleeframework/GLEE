"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, with me getting the larger share.  I want to secure a good amount in the first round, but I also don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, the offered share is still very small. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I can make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  I'm willing to reduce my share slightly due to the inflation, but I still want to secure a sizable portion of the money. This is a compromise, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
