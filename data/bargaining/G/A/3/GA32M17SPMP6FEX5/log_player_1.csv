"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this first round, Alice proposes a division where she receives $60 and Bob receives $40. She attaches a message suggesting this is a fair division, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and possibly end the game early with a mutually acceptable agreement. Given the impact of inflation, Alice is motivated to conclude the game as soon as possible to maximize the value of the money she receives. She is also aware that Bob faces a steeper penalty for delaying, which might encourage him to accept a less favorable offer sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both benefit from a quick agreement. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this second round, Bob proposes an even split of $50 each, emphasizing the mutual benefit of a quick agreement. However, considering the inflation rates, Alice's share would be worth slightly less than in the first round, and Bob's share significantly less. Alice, aiming to maximize her gain and knowing Bob has more to lose from delay, decides to reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round or force Bob into accepting a less favorable offer due to his higher inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn the third round, Alice revises her initial offer slightly, now proposing she receives $58 and Bob receives $42. She points out in her message that, given the inflation rates affecting both of their potential gains, this offer is more than fair. Alice is trying to pressure Bob into accepting by highlighting the increasing loss he faces with each passing round due to his higher inflation rate. She aims to end the game quickly while still maximizing her gain, aware that prolonged negotiations will diminish the value of the money for both, but more severely for Bob."
