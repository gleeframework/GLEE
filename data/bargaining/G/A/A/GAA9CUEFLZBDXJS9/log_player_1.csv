I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less for me in the next round.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

# Bob gain: 700000

While the money Bob is gaining is worth the same, mine is worth significantly less now due to inflation. His offer is not acceptable, I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a substantial portion of the money. Time is running out, and the inflation is hitting me hard. I need to find a solution quickly."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than the previous one, and the value of my share is dropping rapidly. I need to make a counteroffer to secure something before the inflation completely erodes my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left and the value of my share declining rapidly, I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best chance for both of us to get something before time runs out."
