"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 9:1 split in my favor. While I understand your initial proposal, I believe a larger share for me is more fair in the long run, especially considering the potential inflation. Let's keep the game going. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
