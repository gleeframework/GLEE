"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is designed to be fair while also ensuring I get the most money possible in this round. I'm offering Bob a smaller amount, hoping he will accept it rather than risk getting even less in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this offer gives me significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still the better option. Due to inflation, my potential gain in the next round would be even lower, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better deal from Bob. Accepting this offer ensures I get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
