"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can divide the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. Let's see if you'll accept a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less. I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give Bob a 60% share, especially with the inflation factor. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially with inflation. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40% to account for the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept a 55/45 split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! My gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means I'm getting a lot less value out of the same amount of money.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm ready to give him a 55% share, especially since I think I was already being generous with my previous offer. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 55/45 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really affecting the value of the money! My gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and it's getting harder to make ends meet.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to be even more aggressive this time. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gain. I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'm not willing to give up yet. Let's see if you'll accept a 58/42 split. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! My gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which is a staggering decrease. I'm starting to feel the pinch.

However, Bob's offer is... identical to my previous offer! I'm not sure if he's just trying to lull me into a false sense of security or if he's genuinely willing to meet me halfway. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're just mirroring my previous offer. I'm not buying it. Let's try something new.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really crippling my potential gain now! My gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.

I'll try to be even more aggressive this time, but I'll also have to be careful not to leave myself with too little. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up. I need a bigger share to make it worth my while, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
