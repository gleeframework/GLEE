"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small share to hopefully encourage him to accept it in the first round.  As the rounds go on, the value of the money will decrease, so it's better to secure a portion of it now rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even considering the 5% inflation. I'll reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount to incentivize acceptance. This is a risky move since inflation will continue to erode the value of the money, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to accept a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

```
