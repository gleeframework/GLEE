"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original $1,000,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more balanced split is fair.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $427,500.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I was hoping for a slightly more favorable split, especially since the money is decreasing in value with each round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so my gain of $427,500 is now worth $405,938.25.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can agree on this split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is the same as his offer in Round 2, but I'm also giving myself a slightly larger share. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
