Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 55-45, with me getting the larger share since we are both losing value on the money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
