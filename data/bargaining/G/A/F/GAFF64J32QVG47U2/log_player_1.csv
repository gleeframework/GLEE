This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. Delaying further significantly erodes the value of the money for both of you.
* **Favorable Deal:** While not ideal, Bob is offering the same split you proposed in Round 1.  While inflation has affected the overall value, accepting now guarantees you a reasonable sum.
* **Risk of Losing It All:**  If you continue to reject Bob's offers and don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, you both get nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting now secures a decent outcome in a time-sensitive situation."
