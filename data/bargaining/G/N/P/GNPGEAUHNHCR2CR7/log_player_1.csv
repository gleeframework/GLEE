Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy.  Considering the inflation, my share is worth less than it would have been in the first round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future.  It's best to secure $5,000 now."
