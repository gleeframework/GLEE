Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I want to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm taking into account the inflation. It's better to accept this offer and secure some gains than risk losing even more in the next round."
