"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to see if I can do better.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive with my offer, taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for a possible compromise."
