Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need to be fairly compensated.  How about a 52.5/47.5 split? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases for you with every round.  I'm proposing 55/45.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is becoming increasingly resistant, and the shrinking pot due to inflation is working against me. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable outcome. If I reject this offer, there's a high chance we'll reach a stalemate, and both walk away with nothing."
