"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, and keeping 70% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still a 45% share, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of money by 10% since the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
