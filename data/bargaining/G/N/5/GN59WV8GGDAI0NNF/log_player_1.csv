  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message trying to convince him that it's a fair deal. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair but I need a bit more to make this worth my while. This offer is still more than what you offered before. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
