"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal split, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  I'll see how he reacts to this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still incredibly unfair. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to negotiate further. It's important to remember that the value of my earnings is decreasing with each round, so I need to be cautious about accepting anything too low."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60, still a majority of the money, but a significant step up from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will demonstrate my willingness to compromise and encourage Bob to do the same."
