"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. I included the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey that this is a reasonable and equitable division. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I reciprocate your offer, with a slight adjustment for us to reach a more agreeable outcome.  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the message suggests a ""slight adjustment"" for a more agreeable outcome, the offer is actually the opposite of what I proposed in Round 1, with Bob now receiving the larger share. Given that I started with a 60-40 split in my favor and this is just the second round, I'm not ready to accept such a drastic change in the division. Additionally, the inflation hasn't significantly impacted the value yet, so I'm willing to proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I offer a 55-45 split, with me receiving $550,000 and Bob receiving $450,000. My message, ""Meet in the middle,"" suggests that I'm trying to find a compromise between our previous offers. By giving up a bit from my original 60-40 proposal, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable division. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good faith effort to reach a deal and consider accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It appears we have similar ideas. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message suggests that we have similar ideas and that he's trying to be considerate of the inflation affecting my potential gains, the offer still doesn't meet my expectations. The 45-55 split in Bob's favor is closer to what I offered in Round 3, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Considering that we're only in Round 4 and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try and secure a more favorable division. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean that I've conceded to a worse position than my initial proposal, which I'm not ready to do at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's finalize""}\n\nIn this round, I offer a 52.5-47.5 split, with me receiving $525,000 and Bob receiving $475,000. My message, ""Getting closer, let's finalize,"" suggests that I believe we're nearing a mutually acceptable agreement and that it's time to conclude the negotiations. By making a small concession from my previous offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to be flexible and find a compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good opportunity to end the game with a fair division of the money, considering that further rounds will only reduce the value of my share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's wrap this up with my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer. At this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I believe it's wise to accept the 47.5-52.5 split. The difference between this offer and my previous proposal is relatively small, and the risk of further inflation reducing the value of my share is substantial. By accepting this offer, I secure a significant amount of money, albeit less than I initially hoped for. Given the circumstances, I consider this a reasonable compromise and a better outcome than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
