"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate works heavily in my favor.  Alice is losing value much faster than I am. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4250,
""alice_gain"": 5750,
""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, so I'm proposing a slight adjustment that benefits us both considering the time pressure.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:** By taking the lead in Round 2, I establish myself as a serious negotiator.
* **Slight Improvement:** The offer is still relatively close to Alice's initial proposal, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Factor:** The message subtly reminds Alice of the inflation, putting gentle pressure on her to accept a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Future Leverage:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation in later rounds if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, evidenced by her move closer to a 50/50 split. However, her offer is still barely better than her first. With the inflation working in my favor, I'm willing to hold out a bit longer for a more significant concession."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. Let's close the deal and both come out ahead.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Demand:**  I'm upping my asking amount, reflecting the increasingly favorable inflation dynamic.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message is more direct about the time pressure, urging Alice to make a decision.
* **Compromise (Apparent):** While the offer may seem like a small concession from my previous one, the real value for Alice is diminishing quickly with each passing round.  
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still room for further negotiation if needed, but this offer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's getting risky. While not ideal, Alice's offer is now closer to a 55/45 split in my favor considering the current inflation values. Rejecting this offer could lead to even more unfavorable proposals from Alice in the later rounds as the value diminishes rapidly. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a much worse deal later or even timing out altogether."
