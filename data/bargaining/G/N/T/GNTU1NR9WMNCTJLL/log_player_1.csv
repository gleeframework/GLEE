I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  It's a fair start considering inflation could heavily impact me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is tempting, but I can still negotiate. My gain is drastically reduced even with the inflation factor. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to get a bit more this round, but I need to be mindful of the inflation.  I'll offer $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob."
