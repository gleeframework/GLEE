"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars and keeping 80 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to weigh the offer carefully.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle this time. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
