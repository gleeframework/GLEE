Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your need for a deal, but we both need to make sure we're getting a fair share.  This offer gives you a good chunk of the money, but also gives me a chance to benefit from the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
