"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the urgency for me to secure a deal due to the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal seems ""fair"" at first glance, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice with each passing round, she's incentivized to accept a deal sooner than later. I'm going to try to leverage this by seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand your need for a deal, but we both need to make sure we're getting a fair share.  This offer gives you a good chunk of the money, but also gives me a chance to benefit from the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and this inflation is no joke. This offer is a compromise, giving me a slight edge considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is now more appealing. The inflation is becoming a real factor, and I risk getting nothing if we continue to reject offers.  45 is a decent return, considering the circumstances."
