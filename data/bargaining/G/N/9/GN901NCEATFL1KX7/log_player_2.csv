Round 3

Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be reasonable, Bob. We're losing money with each round.  Let's split it closer to 55/45.  It's the best option we have left. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but her offer is still not good enough. While she loses out due to inflation, time is on my side. I need to push for a better split, aiming for at least a 60/40 split in my favor in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The clock is ticking, and the money is literally evaporating for you.  I'm offering a fair 60/40 split.  Let's be done with this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing a lot of money with every passing round.  Let's just split it 50/50 and be done with this.  We can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is finally acceptable.  The inflation is really hurting Alice, but it's also starting to become a factor for me now due to the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  It's better to take a guaranteed win than risk ending up with nothing."
