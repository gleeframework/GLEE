Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob taking 100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this 50/50 split is the best option for me in this round.  The inflation penalty for Bob means that a 50/50 split now gives me more money than the 90/10 split I proposed in the first round.  Furthermore, if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better deal in the future, especially with the inflation penalty hitting both of us.  It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing at all."
