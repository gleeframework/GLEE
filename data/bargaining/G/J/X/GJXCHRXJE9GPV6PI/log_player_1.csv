"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000 and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob is offering me $400,000, which is only 40% of the remaining $1,000,000, I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money worth 48.8% less, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 300,000 I'd get, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
