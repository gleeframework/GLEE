"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. Easy peasy!""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I still get the majority! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth 10% less, I'm now looking at a gain of $400,000, which is a significant reduction from the $500,000 I was initially offered.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

For now, I'll reject this offer.
