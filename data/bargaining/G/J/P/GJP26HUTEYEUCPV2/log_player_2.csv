"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's agree and avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too lopsided in your favor. Let's go with a 70/30 split. We both lose less with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting, and a 30% share is not bad."
