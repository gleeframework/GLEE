"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider that.

My gain is still 40 dollars, but Bob's gain is now worth 5% less, so it's effectively 57.50 dollars.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather have a higher share of the money. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation.

Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more this round""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle this round 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

My gain is still 55 dollars, but Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less, so it's effectively 47.33 dollars.

I'll accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.
