6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  It's a good deal considering the inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think we can both do better than that.  Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor this time. We can work out a better deal in the next few rounds.,Bob,2,
,,"That's not much different from your last offer, Bob! I'm willing to negotiate, but this seems a bit greedy. Let's try for something more balanced in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay Bob, how about a compromise?  $5500 for me, $4500 for you.  That's a better split than my last offer and gives us both a decent share considering we're already in round 3.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm sticking with my previous offer.  A 60/40 split is fair, and we're losing value with every round we pass. Let's get this done!",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money because of your stubbornness!  I'm offering a reasonable compromise, but you're not budging. I'm willing to walk away with nothing if you don't start negotiating fairly.",Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. $5200 for me, $4800 for you. It's more than fair, and we're running out of time. If you reject this, I'm done negotiating and we both lose!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's reach an agreement quickly.",Bob,6,
,,"Alright Bob, you win. Let's take it before we lose even more.",Alice,6,accept
