  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise.""

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it evenly

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $5,000 I would get in this round is only worth $4,000 in terms of purchasing power compared to the first round.

I'm not willing to accept an even split, since I'm getting less than I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer.
