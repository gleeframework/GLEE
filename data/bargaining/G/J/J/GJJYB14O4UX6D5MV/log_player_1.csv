"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. I'm open to adjusting the split, but I want to emphasize that each round of negotiation will reduce the value of the money, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement quickly.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects it, I'll be happy to consider his counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because I believe a 40-60 split in his favor is not a fair division, especially considering the initial amount was $1,000,000 and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'm willing to continue negotiating to reach a more equitable agreement.\n\nPlease let me know that my rejection has been relayed to Bob, and I'll prepare for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I believe it's essential to find a mutually acceptable agreement quickly. I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in meeting me halfway and accept this offer.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my proposal. If he rejects it, I'll be prepared to consider his next counteroffer."
