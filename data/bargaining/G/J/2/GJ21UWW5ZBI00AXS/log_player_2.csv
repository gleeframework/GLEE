"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 90/10, with me getting the larger share. I think this is a fair starting point, given the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to accept a large sum, it's worth noting that Alice's offer is extremely lopsided, and I can likely get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation factor will only benefit me if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects a fairer balance given the potential for inflation. Let's reach a solution quickly before the money loses too much value."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway this time with a 50/50 split. It's in both our best interests to reach an agreement before we lose too much value from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair and equitable solution, and with the increasing risk of losing value due to inflation, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
