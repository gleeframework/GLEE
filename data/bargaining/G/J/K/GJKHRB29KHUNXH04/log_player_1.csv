"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start with a relatively aggressive offer, taking 90% of the money. This is to see how Bob responds and to gauge his risk appetite. I'll adjust my strategy depending on his decision and the impact of inflation on future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation.  Accepting ensures I get something, and the risk of further rounds is too high.  The 10% loss on my side is significant, and even if I were to reject and propose a counter-offer, there's no guarantee Bob will accept.  It's better to secure a decent portion of the money now."
