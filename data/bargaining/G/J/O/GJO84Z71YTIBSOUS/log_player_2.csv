"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering my advantage in inflation rate 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation rates. I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a slightly more balanced split, taking into account the inflation rates.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my proposed split, Alice's offer is now more advantageous due to inflation. It's better to secure a portion of the money rather than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
