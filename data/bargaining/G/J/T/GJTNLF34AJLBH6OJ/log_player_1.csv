Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both have an equal chance of winning if we keep playing, so a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
