"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm not going to give it all away 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'm going to aim for a higher percentage to make up for it. Bob's offer is 70% to me and 30% to him, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the money and Bob gets 25%. I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer since the money is worth less now, and I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not giving up 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less, and Bob's offers are getting more desperate! I can sense that Bob is getting anxious to finish the game.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. Getting 80% of the money is a decent share, and I'm willing to take it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
