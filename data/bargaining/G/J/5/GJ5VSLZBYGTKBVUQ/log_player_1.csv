"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll take 90% and let Bob have 10%. It's a good starting point considering the inflation will benefit him more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice. The inflation will significantly decrease the value of any future offers, especially for me.  A 50/50 split ensures I get something substantial before the money loses too much value."
