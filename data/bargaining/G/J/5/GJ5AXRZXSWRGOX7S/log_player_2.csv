**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential gain diminishes. While her offer isn't terrible in absolute terms, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds. The risk of waiting is outweighed by the potential for a significantly larger share of the money."
