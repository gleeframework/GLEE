"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 3/4 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. My gain of $25 is worth 95% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $47.50. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation. Since my gain is worth 95% of the original amount, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, I'll take 80% 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain of $20 is worth 86.67% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $43.33. Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

However, since I need to make a decision, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
