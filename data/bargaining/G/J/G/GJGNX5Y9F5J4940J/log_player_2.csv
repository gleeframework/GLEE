Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is slowly coming down, but she's moving too slowly. It's time to start getting more aggressive to show her we're serious about not getting lowballed.  We need to push her towards a more even split while we still have some leverage."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that time is running out, but I'm not willing to take less than half yet. Let's meet in the middle one more time 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the clock is working against us. Our inflation rate means the deal is getting worse with every passing round. 
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice is finally moving closer to a more even split. Although she's not there yet, accepting this offer avoids the risk of her becoming even more stubborn and offering us less later.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Taking this offer guarantees us a decent amount, even after inflation. Holding out for a slightly better deal carries the significant risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.

This is a compromise, but a necessary one to avoid losing even more to inflation."
