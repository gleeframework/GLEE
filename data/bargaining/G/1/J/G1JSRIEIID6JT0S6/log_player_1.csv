"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get 600,000 dollars and Bob gets 400,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's effectively proposing that I get 300,000 dollars and he gets 560,000 dollars.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 550,000 dollars and Bob gets 450,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, he's effectively proposing that I get 450,000 dollars and he gets 284,000 dollars (since 550,000 x 0.5162 = 283,712, but I'll round it to 284,000 for simplicity).

I'll accept this offer.
