I'm going to propose a split of 90/10 in my favor. Since I get to propose first, I'm taking the lion's share. However, I'm leaving Bob a small amount to ensure he doesn't immediately reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significant. It's better to accept 85 now, as waiting for another round risks losing even more value due to inflation."
