"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's try something more balanced 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $4,800 (20% less), and Bob's $4,000 gain is now worth $3,600 (10% less).

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more balanced, but I'm still not getting a good deal. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value due to inflation.
