"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is actually the same as my initial offer, but with the labels swapped.

I'll decide to reject this offer since it's the same as the one I made initially. The game continues!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was the same as mine, but with the labels swapped, I'll try to take a slightly larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
