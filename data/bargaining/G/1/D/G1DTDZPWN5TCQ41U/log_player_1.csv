"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. I'd like to aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation. I'll wait for his next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is still affecting me, and my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share to account for the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain now, and it's worth only 40.8% of what it was in the first round (64% of 63.8% of 80%).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll have to weigh the risks of rejecting it and going into another round. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
