"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount as well. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation, the money is worth 40% less than the original amount. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I gain. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I'll accept this offer, as it's a good deal given the circumstances.
