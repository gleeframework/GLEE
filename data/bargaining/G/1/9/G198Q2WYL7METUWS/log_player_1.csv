"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering 60 dollars for myself and 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts would be:

* Alice gain: 70 / 0.8 = 87.5
* Bob gain: 30 / 0.8 = 37.5

I accept this offer.
