"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can both get our shares and avoid the inflation that will come with each passing round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is worth less to him than it was in the first round, so I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, so take it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500, which is still a relatively small share, but I'm trying to be generous considering the inflation. I'm keeping $7,500 for myself, which is a bit more than my initial offer."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him the majority of the share. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm not ready to give up the majority of the share just yet!"

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

# Bob's message: I'm getting a worse deal with each round, so I need to get a bigger share. Let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and he's trying to compensate for the inflation by taking a larger share. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. I'm not willing to give him the majority of the share, especially since he's getting a worse deal with each round. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
