"Round 1

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share to get something right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less in future rounds due to inflation. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share than last time.  Since he rejected my previous offer, I think he's more likely to accept something now, even if it's a bit less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to get more money each round. While I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal.  I'll reject again and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still confident that I can get a decent share.  With each round, the money is worth less to me, so I need to get a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, and my money is losing value. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal. This is getting risky, but I think I can still get a better outcome than this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again. Bob is clearly trying to get as much as possible, but with the inflation hitting me harder, I need to get a deal soon.  This is a significant concession, but I still believe I can get a better outcome than accepting Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really trying to push for a very unbalanced deal. While I'm losing money fast due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept this yet. I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to compromise a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a difficult situation. Inflation is hitting me hard, and Bob is being very stubborn. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is the most I can offer, and I hope that he'll finally accept. It's a gamble, but with only a few rounds left, I need to find a way to secure at least some of the money."
