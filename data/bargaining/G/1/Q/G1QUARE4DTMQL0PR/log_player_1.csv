Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, which is still a decent amount.

I accept Bob's offer.
