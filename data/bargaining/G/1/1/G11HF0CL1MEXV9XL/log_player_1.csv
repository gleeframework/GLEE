"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's a fair starting point.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share since I have the advantage of proposing this round."
