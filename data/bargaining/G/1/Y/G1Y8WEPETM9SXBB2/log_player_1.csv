"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share, which is $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000. I'm framing it as a ""risk"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now $6,400. Bob's $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now $1,800.

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, as he's taking a bigger share than before, and I'm getting less. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a bigger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but still fair, right?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" offer to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's now $3,120. Bob's $4,000 is now worth 73.9% of its original value, so it's now $2,936.

A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable offer, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept it.
