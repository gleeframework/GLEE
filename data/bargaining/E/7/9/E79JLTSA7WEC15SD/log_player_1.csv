"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. Since this is the first round and the inflation is unknown, I'm aiming for a large share, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes it risky to reject this offer.  If I reject, I'll be the one making the offer next round, but the money will be worth even less then.  Accepting 6000 is better than risking getting even less in the next round."
