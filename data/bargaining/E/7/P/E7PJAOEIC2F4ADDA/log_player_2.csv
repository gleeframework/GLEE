Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a significant amount, but I need to look out for myself too. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice's offer is getting closer to reasonable, and with each round, the value of her potential gain diminishes significantly due to the 10% inflation. This weakens her bargaining position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to hold out for a better deal is risky. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything near this amount in future rounds. She might become increasingly desperate and offer even less.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a significant sum of $300,000. It's better to secure a decent amount than risk ending up with a much smaller amount or even nothing if the negotiations completely break down.

While I could hold out hope for Alice to crack and accept a smaller share in later rounds, the risk associated with that strategy outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
