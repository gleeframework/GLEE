I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to secure a large portion of the money while it's still worth the most.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is less than what I proposed in the first round, it's still a significant amount of money.  Considering the 20% inflation, I'm better off accepting this offer and getting something rather than risking getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's proposals."
