Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more willing to negotiate as the rounds go on and the value of the money decreases, especially since it decreases faster for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""I'm proposing a slightly better split for me this time.  Let's not drag this out and lose too much value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, but she's still trying to take a larger share.  I'll hold out a bit longer and see if she gets more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting tense! Alice is definitely feeling the heat, but she's still trying to hold on to a significantly larger share. I'm willing to push this a little further.  She's losing value much faster than I am."
