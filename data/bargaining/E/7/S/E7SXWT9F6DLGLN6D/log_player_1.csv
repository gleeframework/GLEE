Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair deal.""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm getting desperate. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
