"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept this offer. With inflation, my share is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's share is worth 20% less than in the first round. This means I'm getting less value for my share compared to Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to ensure I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split in my favor, but still trying to be reasonable and give Bob a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I need a slightly larger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like this offer. Bob's share is still worth less than mine, and he's not budging much from his previous offer. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm getting tired of negotiating. Meet me at this point or we'll both lose out.""
}
```

I'm trying to push the negotiation in my favor, but still leaving room for Bob to accept. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offer is actually a 50-50 split, just like my original offer! But considering the inflation, Bob's share is actually worth less than mine. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm pushing the negotiation even further in my favor, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going back and forth."
