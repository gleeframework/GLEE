Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, getting 350,000 is better than nothing at this point.  The risk of getting nothing is too high if I continue rejecting."
