Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer is a starting point, giving Alice a slightly larger share. It allows for negotiation and leaves room for both players to potentially gain more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 
 
This offer is a 50/50 split, acknowledging the inflation that has occurred and offering a fair deal for both players.  The previous rounds of negotiation have shown that a significant power shift has taken place due to inflation, so it's in Alice's best interest to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000} 
```

While Bob's offer was less appealing,  it's clear he's willing to negotiate. This offer represents a middle ground. Alice acknowledges the impact of inflation on Bob's share but still seeks a larger portion for herself."
