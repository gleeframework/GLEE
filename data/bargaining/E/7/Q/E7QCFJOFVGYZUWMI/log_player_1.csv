"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob. I'm trying to get the most I can in the first round, but I'm aware that inflation will affect future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting even less in the next round due to inflation.  Even with the 10% loss from the first round, 50$ is a decent gain."
