"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both have a chance to propose. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain would be $4,500, which is 10% less than $5,000.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a different split, considering the reduced value of money.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again in the third round, my gain would be $4,050 (10% less than $4,500).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
