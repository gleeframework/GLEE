"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain."
