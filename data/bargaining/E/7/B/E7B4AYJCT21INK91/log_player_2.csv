"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. We can adjust it later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer that benefits me more. The current offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which I don't consider fair. With 11 rounds left, I have time to negotiate for a better deal. Despite the inflation, I believe I can achieve a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to propose a division that gives me 60% of the total amount. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to secure a larger share to compensate for the potential loss. This split still gives Alice a substantial amount, and I believe it's a more reasonable starting point for negotiations.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a more equal split is fair. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is more favorable than the initial one, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. With 9 rounds left, I have time to try and secure a larger share. The current offer gives me 40% of the total amount, but considering the inflation, I would actually receive less value than that. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a larger share to compensate for the loss. This is my adjusted proposal.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money for me, I've decided to increase my proposed share to 70%. This split gives Alice 30%, which is still a substantial amount. I believe this proposal takes into account the impact of inflation on my potential gain, and I'm hoping Alice will consider it a fair adjustment.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We're both losing value with each round, and a fair split is the best way to maximize our gains at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe accepting the 50/50 split is the best decision at this point. With 7 rounds left, the value of the money will continue to decrease for me, and I risk ending up with a much lower amount if I continue to negotiate. Alice's offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it to secure a fair share of the remaining value.\n\n###"
