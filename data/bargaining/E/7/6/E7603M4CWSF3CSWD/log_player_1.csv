"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to give you $45, but I'd like to keep $55.  It's a fair deal considering the money is worth less each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
