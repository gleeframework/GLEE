"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I get $60, you get $40.  This seems fair to me considering the money loses value over time, especially for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to give you $45, but I'd like to keep $55.  It's a fair deal considering the money is worth less each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I'm willing to accept anything less than a 50/50 split. The devaluation hurts me more than you, and waiting any longer is just pointless for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
