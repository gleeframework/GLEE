"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, Alice. Let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be fair, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 500,000 just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, Alice. But I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I need to be careful not to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. 600,000 is a decent share, and I'm not sure I can do better."
