"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor, recognizing your initial offer.  This gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
