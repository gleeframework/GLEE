Let's see if Bob is willing to share the wealth!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll take it!  Even though I'm getting a little less, it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
