"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split somewhat evenly, but a bit more in my favor considering the inflation disadvantage I have. This way we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation, it's too early to settle. There's still a lot of rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This is a fair deal, and it ensures both of us get a good share before inflation starts to affect the value too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the even split offer, but the inflation is working against me. Let's meet in the middle a bit more to make it worthwhile for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit more in her favor, but it's not unreasonable given the inflation. It's also in my best interest to accept, as it's unlikely I can get a better deal in future rounds due to the shrinking value of the money."
