"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a good starting point, as the money is worth less to me in each round. Let's see if we can find a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. How about a 55-45 split in my favor? It's still a fair deal, considering the money's value is decreasing.""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to find a middle ground, while still getting a slightly better deal due to the decreasing value of money."
