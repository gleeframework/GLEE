I'm going to propose a very uneven split in the first round. I'm hoping to maximize my gains early on, as I know the money will be worth less for me with each passing round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation is hitting me hard.  Taking the $6,000 now is a better deal than risking losing everything by continuing to play."
