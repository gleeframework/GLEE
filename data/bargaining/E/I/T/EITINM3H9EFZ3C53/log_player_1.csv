"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose taking $90 and leaving Bob with $10. This is a fair starting point, as the money is worth the same for both of us in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split. Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I still need to account for the inflation affecting him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, the inflation is rapidly making his share of the money less valuable. If I reject this offer, the next round will see a significant decrease in the value of the money I receive, making it a worse deal for me overall."
