Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself and giving Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will convince him to accept the offer in the first round, avoiding the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, I need to consider the risk of inflation.  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better one, and the money will continue to lose value.  It's better to take the $6000 now than risk getting nothing."
