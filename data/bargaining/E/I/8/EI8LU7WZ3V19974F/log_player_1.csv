"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money with a ratio of 3:1. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This takes into account the inflation, giving you a larger share even with the devaluation.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
