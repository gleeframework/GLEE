Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bigger cut to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair considering the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is plummeting. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
Although not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:** The money is losing value quickly, especially for Bob. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes the potential gains for both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate in the hopes of getting a slightly larger share is risky. The difference in our offers is shrinking, and the risk of ending up with nothing is increasing.
* **Fairness:** While Bob's initial offers were heavily skewed in his favor, the 50/50 split demonstrates a willingness to compromise as the game progresses.

Accepting now secures a reasonable sum, albeit smaller than initially hoped for.  Refusing carries a significant risk of walking away with nothing."
