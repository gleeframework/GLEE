"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous share considering the inflation factor. Now it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the money.

```
{
