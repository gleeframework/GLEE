"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively even split, but I'm giving myself a slightly larger share. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
