"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want to keep a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! My share is worth a lot less now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not happy with the 30/70 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
