"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim to get a bigger share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money for me, I'll try to get a better deal. My current offer was 70, but now it's worth less due to inflation, so I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate. However, Alice's offer is higher than my previous offer, so I'll accept this one.
