3500.0,6500.0,"I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 65/35 split is more equitable. Let's see if we can agree on this!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to come down a bit, but 65/35 is too far. How about 55/45?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I think we can make this work.  I'm willing to go with a 70/30 split. It's fair, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. We're losing money with every round! A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, with each round, the value of the money decreases.  Let's cut to the chase and agree on a 75/25 split. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to secure a decent share of the money before it diminishes further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're pushing me.  This is my final offer - 45/55.  Any more of this back and forth and we both lose.",Alice,7,
