"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, and there's no apparent reason to believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer seems like the most straightforward and fair decision. It gives both Alice and me an equal share of $50 each."
