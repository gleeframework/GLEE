"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a significant amount to make the deal worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll reject Bob's offer. The money is worth less now, and I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep the majority of the money."
