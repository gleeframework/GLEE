"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise. This is a good starting point for further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is actually $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to keep negotiating. Your offer is a bit too even for me.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, so my gain of $1,000,000 is actually $1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to Alice, but I think 450k is too low. Let's try to find a sweet spot. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, and we're in Round 4, the money is worth 10% less twice, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. So, my gain of $450,000 is actually $450,000 * 0.81 = $364,500.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll accept your offer. It's a good compromise.""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $364,500 for me and $550,000 for him. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
