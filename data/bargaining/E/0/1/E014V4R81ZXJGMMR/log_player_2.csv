"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rate difference. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds ""fair"" on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. It's in my best interest to stall and negotiate a better deal as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation difference, how about we meet closer to the middle?""}

**Reasoning:** I'm nudging the offer slightly in my favor while still appearing somewhat reasonable. This tests Alice's willingness to negotiate and buys me more time for the inflation to work in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your end, this is a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure from the inflation difference and is sweetening the pot, but very slowly.  It's still early in the game, and even with the inflation factored in, I can get a better deal by waiting a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time with incremental offers. A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and fair option.""}

**Reasoning:**  By round 4, the pressure is on for both of us. Offering a 50/50 split might seem like a sudden jump, but it accomplishes a few things:

* **Projects Fairness:**  While I know the inflation favors me, this makes me appear more agreeable and less greedy.
* **Time Pressure:** It puts the pressure back on Alice. If she rejects this, she'll seem unreasonable, especially with the looming deadline.
* **Potential Acceptance:** There's a chance Alice might accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing. Even with the inflation difference, a 50/50 split isn't bad for her at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 offer ignores the inflation difference, I'm willing to meet closer but not that far. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Although the inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains, Alice's counter-offer shows she is willing to negotiate above her initial proposals.  I'll hold out for one more round to see if she'll move closer to a 50/50 split, knowing this is my last chance for a significant gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is a very reasonable compromise considering the inflation. Let's close the deal and avoid getting nothing.""}

**Reasoning:** This is a strategic move balancing several factors:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the threat of getting $0 is very real for both of us.
* **Inflation Impact:** While not ideal, even with the 59.04% inflation,  $480,000 is still a significant sum. Delaying further risks a much lower payout.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  I've slightly lowered my demand from the 50/50 split, showing willingness to compromise. This makes it harder for Alice to justify rejecting and risking a total loss. 

This offer applies maximum pressure on Alice to accept, while still securing me a good portion of the money despite the inflation disadvantage."
