Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a reasonable balance between our shares while taking into account the potential decrease in value of the money for Bob. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
