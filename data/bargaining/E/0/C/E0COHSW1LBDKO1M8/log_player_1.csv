"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my gain of $500,000 in this round is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
