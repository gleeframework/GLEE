"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the pie.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 ratio, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. Let's split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's proposal is a bit too generous, considering I'm the one who made the first move. However, I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to get a significant amount of money, especially since the money is worth 20% less than before.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
