# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the money's value will drop. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split now. We both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to take the risk of further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to inch back towards his original, greedy offer.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to risk it for a better share. Accepting now would show weakness."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both want a fair share, but considering the decreasing value, I'm willing to push a bit more in my favor. It's still a decent offer for you. 
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting bolder, trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. He's clearly aiming for a much larger share. I need to hold strong and signal that I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds for a better deal.  Accepting now would be a significant loss."

""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. We're both losing money with each passing round due to inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point.""
