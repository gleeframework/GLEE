"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""My turn. How about a slight adjustment for a better outcome for both of us? This ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement this round.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Bob needs to be mindful of the rapid inflation decreasing the value of his potential winnings.  
* **Round 1 Rejection:**  Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Bob's rejection signals he's not settling for significantly less than half.
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering Alice slightly less (4800) than what she proposed for Bob (6000) makes it more appealing than waiting. It also secures Bob a larger share than he'd get if Alice proposes in Round 3. 
* **Message:**  By framing it as a ""better outcome for both,"" Bob encourages Alice to accept and avoid the risk of further inflation eating into Bob's potential gain (and thus her potential gain in later rounds)."
