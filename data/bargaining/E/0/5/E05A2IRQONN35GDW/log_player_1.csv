"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This feels like a fair starting point, given that I'll be the one taking the risk of rejection in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less,  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try and secure a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm willing to concede some of my initial gains to avoid going back and forth, but I still believe a 60% share is fair considering the inflation factor."
