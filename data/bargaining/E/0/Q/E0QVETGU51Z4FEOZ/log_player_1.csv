"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount to start, leaving me with $70. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for future inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a more generous split than my initial offer, I think I can do better. The reduced value of money due to inflation means that $60 is worth less than $30 in the first round, so I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a more aggressive move considering the reduced value of money. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a compromise."
