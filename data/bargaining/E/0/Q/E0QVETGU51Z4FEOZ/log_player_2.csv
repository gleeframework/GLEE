"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is fair, it's important to see how Alice will react to rejection. Bob can potentially get a better deal if he rejects and proposes a more favorable split in the next round, considering the potential inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for future inflation.  Let's get this done.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob's potential gain is now significantly reduced due to inflation, accepting this offer guarantees a 50/50 split, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate.  There's no guarantee that Alice will be willing to budge further in subsequent rounds, and the inflation will continue to erode Bob's potential gains."
