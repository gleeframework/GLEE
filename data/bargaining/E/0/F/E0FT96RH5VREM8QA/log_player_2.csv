Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This is likely the best offer you'll get from me. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is working against Bob much faster.  It's better to push for a slightly better deal now than risk getting even less later as the value decreases more rapidly for Bob than Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it - a perfectly even split. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial before inflation hurts us further.""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains.  Alice is likely aware of this and may be trying to push Bob into accepting a less favorable deal as time runs out. A 50/50 split is fair and gives Bob the best chance of securing a reasonable amount before the devaluation becomes even more significant."
