"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure it's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it's a good starting point to see how he's thinking.  I'm curious to see if he'll even try to negotiate, or if he'll just take the bare minimum to get something.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer, and it's much better than getting nothing.  I'm happy to accept it."
