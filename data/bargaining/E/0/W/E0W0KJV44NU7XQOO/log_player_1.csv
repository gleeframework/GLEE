"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll.

I'm not sure I want to give up 50% of the remaining value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the remaining value, leaving you with 40%. It's a good deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 75% of the remaining value, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer to get something out of the game.
