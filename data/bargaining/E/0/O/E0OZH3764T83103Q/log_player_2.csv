Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is too much in your favor. Let's split it 60/40. This shows a willingness to meet in the middle, and with inflation affecting us both, it's a good deal for everyone. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
