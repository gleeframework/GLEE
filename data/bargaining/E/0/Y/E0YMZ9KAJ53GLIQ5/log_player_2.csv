"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that Alice's money is worth less each round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering your money loses value faster. Let's make this quick!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. This offer still benefits you greatly, and we both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer again. Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in. I'll try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm being generous here. Let's cut this short and both get something. I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming a serious factor. Accepting this 50/50 split is the best way to secure some money before we both lose everything."
