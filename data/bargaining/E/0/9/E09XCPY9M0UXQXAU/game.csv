6000.0,4000.0,I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation working against you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm proposing we split the money 60/40, but in my favor this time. While inflation hurts us both, it hits you harder, so let's be fair to each other.",Bob,2,
,,"That's not fair at all, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but 60/40 in your favor is too much.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about a 55/45 split? It accounts for the inflation but is still a decent deal for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's be practical.  We're both losing money with every round. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go at this point.  We can stop the bleeding and walk away with something.,Bob,4,
,,"Alright Bob, a 50/50 split it is.  Let's not risk losing any more to inflation.",Alice,4,accept
