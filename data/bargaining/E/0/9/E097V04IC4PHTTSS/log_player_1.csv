I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the money will be worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to offer $800,000 to myself and $200,000 to Bob.  Since the money is depreciating more quickly for me than for Bob, I need to offer him a bit more to ensure a fair division."

Bob is trying to take advantage of the increasing inflation rate. I will continue to propose a more even split, even if it means less money for me in the long run."

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, but I'm not going to give in to his demands. We are still very early in the game, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal."

I'm offering a slightly lower amount to myself, hoping to incentivize Bob to agree.  We are getting close to the end, and I want to ensure that both of us get something."
