"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer seems like a bad deal, it's best to reject it in the first round.  There's a lot of time left, and the potential for a better deal as the rounds progress.  Furthermore, the inflation rate means Alice loses a lot more value with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is better than the first, it's still not a good deal. The inflation rate means Alice is losing a significant amount of value with each round.  There's still time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still offers a good deal to Alice. The inflation will continue to hurt her more than it will me, so she might be more motivated to accept a less than ideal offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is starting to get desperate, but the offer is still not good enough. The inflation is hitting her hard, and I need to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm going to stick with my previous offer. The inflation is hurting Alice more, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if we keep going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting close to my ideal, and we are running out of rounds. The inflation is working in my favor, but accepting a smaller share than my desired 70% is probably a good move."
