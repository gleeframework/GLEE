"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much, let's start with a good base""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I'd like to propose a more even split.  Let's each take $6000 and call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $4,000 and Bob will take $6,000. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further reduced value."
