"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leave Bob with 400,000 dollars. It's a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will want to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'll think for a moment... Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer, since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

I'll accept this offer.
