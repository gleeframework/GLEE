"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amounts.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $50, which is equivalent to 50% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 40% of the original amount (since 50% of $100 is $50, and 20% less is $40).

However, I'll consider the offer as it is, and accept it to avoid further negotiations.
