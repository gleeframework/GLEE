"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than mine, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his 60% is actually equivalent to 48% of the original $100.

In this case, I'll reject the offer, as I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40% for me and 60% for him, and I rejected it, I'll try to get a better deal for myself this time.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, while still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, his 65% is actually equivalent to about 33.5% of the original $100.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
