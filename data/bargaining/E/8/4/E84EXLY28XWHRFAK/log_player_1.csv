"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100 and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation affects us differently. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's revised offer seems reasonable. I'll accept his proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
