"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of the next round. Let's see if we can both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain. Considering Bob's message, I'm inclined to accept his offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, hoping Bob will consider it a reasonable compromise."
