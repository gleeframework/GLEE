"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is slightly better than mine, but still not ideal. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value due to inflation, Bob's offer is now a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll decide to accept this offer.
