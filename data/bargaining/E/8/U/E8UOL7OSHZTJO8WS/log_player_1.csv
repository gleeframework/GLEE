"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small share, but I'm taking the majority! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think this is a very generous offer, considering the money is worth 10% less than before.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, with each of us getting $50. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take what you can get! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Wow, Bob's offer is getting more and more aggressive! I'm not thrilled about getting only $10, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will come back to the table with a better proposal later.
