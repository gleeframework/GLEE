"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is quite generous from Bob's side, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to think about it.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept the offer.
