"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what I was proposing, I still have 10 more rounds to negotiate.  My money is worth less now, but the potential for a better offer in the future still outweighs the risk of accepting this offer."

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which is tempting, but the inflation is making my share worth significantly less than it was in the beginning. I have several rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
