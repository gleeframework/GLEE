"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the initial offer seems enticing, Alice is getting a much better deal. Additionally, the inflation rate hurts Alice much more than it hurts me. I should be able to negotiate a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable considering the inflation rates we face.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not favorable to me in the long run. I need to hold out for a better split, knowing her position will continue to weaken."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the value is dropping rapidly. I'm offering a 65/35 split.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know time is of the essence, but I still think I can get a better deal. Meet me in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, offering to ""meet in the middle"" while still taking the lion's share. This means her walk-away point is getting closer, and I can afford to push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this 70/30 split before the inflation eats away any chance of a decent agreement for you.""
