"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a good starting point, but I'd like to take a bit more. Let's see if we can negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 45 is a good starting point for me, and I'm not willing to give up 15 dollars more than I did in the first round. I'd like to propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm trying to find a middle ground and propose a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
