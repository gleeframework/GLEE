"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share but still giving Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking a very aggressive stance! While I would be happy to take $2,000, I'm not going to let him take $8,000 in this round.  I'm going to see what he offers next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference this round.  I'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. This is a fair compromise, as I'm giving up a decent amount from my previous offer, and Bob is getting more than he was offered last round. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too aggressive, even with the inflation discount he's getting.  I'm not going to agree to that, and I'm going to see what he offers next round."

Round 5

I'm going to try and split the difference again, but I'm going to offer more for myself.  I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob.  This is a fair compromise considering Bob's last offer, and I believe we can reach an agreement this round."

```

I'm going to make a final attempt to reach an agreement this round. I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob.  This is a very generous offer considering the inflation on Bob's side. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him."
