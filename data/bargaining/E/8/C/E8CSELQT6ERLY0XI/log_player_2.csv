"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share. Let's go with a 55/45 split in my favor. Inflation is hurting us both, so let's make a deal and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting is the better option for Bob, even though it's not an equal split. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** Inflation is eating away at the total value. Delaying further means less money for both.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's share is getting hit harder by inflation (36% loss vs. Alice's 9.75%).  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting risks getting an even worse deal in a future round if Alice plays hardball.

While 45% isn't ideal, it's better to secure a decent sum now than risk getting a much smaller amount later.
