"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering that the money is still worth the same as in the first round for me, but Bob's gain is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. It's getting late, and I don't want to risk losing everything. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer, taking into account that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it seems like a decent compromise.
