"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is fairer.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, but I'm willing to consider it since the game is already in its second round. With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
