# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $3000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $2700.

I don't like the fact that Bob is taking a larger share now. I think I can do better.

I don't think Bob is being very generous, and I'm not sure if I want to close the gap that much.
