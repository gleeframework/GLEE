"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair start 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a lower share. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
