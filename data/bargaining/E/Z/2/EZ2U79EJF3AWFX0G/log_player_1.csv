"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering to give Bob 50% of the money, which is a fair and equal split. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth less than before. Bob's offer is still a bit biased towards him, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
