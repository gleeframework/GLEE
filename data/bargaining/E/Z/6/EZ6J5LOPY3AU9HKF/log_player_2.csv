"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's get this started! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a risky move, but starting with a rejection signals Bob's desire for a more even split.  He'll need to be careful as the rounds progress and the money depreciates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic, Bob. Inflation is a factor, and we need to consider that.  I'm still offering a good share, but I need to protect my own interests too. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should continue to reject. While this offer is better than the previous round, Alice is still taking a much larger share. Bob needs to continue pushing for a more even split, even though time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  Let's compromise - a 45/55 split acknowledges inflation while ensuring we both get a significant portion.""}
