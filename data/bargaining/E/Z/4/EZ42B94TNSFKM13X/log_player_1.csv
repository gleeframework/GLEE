Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. This is just the beginning. I propose a more balanced split for us to work from. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 520000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out, and this money is losing value. I'm proposing a split that is fair and gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm aiming to secure at least 50% of the initial sum.  I'm willing to push the negotiations a bit further as the 27.1% inflation isn't too drastic yet. Bob is clearly feeling the time pressure and will likely concede more in the next round."
