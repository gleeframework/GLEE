Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm going to offer him a small amount and see if he'll accept it in the hopes he doesn't realize the inflation will hurt him more than me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, it's still better to keep playing and potentially get a better deal later on.  Bob's offer is too lopsided, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this round.  While I'm still taking the majority, I'm giving Bob a more significant share than before.  Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him into accepting, as the inflation is going to continue to bite into my gains if we keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While inflation is hitting me hard, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is becoming increasingly greedy, but I'm confident I can sway him in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this round.  Inflation has been hitting me hard, and I don't think I can afford to reject another offer.  Hopefully, Bob will be reasonable and see that this is the fairest deal for both of us."
