Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor. I figure Bob might accept it as it's still a decent amount of money, and if he rejects, I'll have the chance to make another offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing even more in the next round."
