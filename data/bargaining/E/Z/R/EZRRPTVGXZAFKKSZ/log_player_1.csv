"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious with my next offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the initial $10,000 due to inflation, I'll aim to get a bigger share this round.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, I'll have to be even more cautious.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the current value of the money. I'll accept his offer from Round 4.
