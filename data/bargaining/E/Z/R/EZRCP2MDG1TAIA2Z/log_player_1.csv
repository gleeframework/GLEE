"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and simple way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not feeling generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual values.

In the first round, Bob's gain was 50. With 20% less value, his gain in the second round would be 40.

Now, let's compare the offers:

My gain in the first round was 50, and I'll get 50 in the second round if I accept this offer. The proposed offer is 70, which is more than 50.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
