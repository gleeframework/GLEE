"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, Alice is offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer, as the game rules state that the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round. By framing the offer as ""fair,"" Alice is trying to create a psychological incentive for Bob to accept the proposal rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob's response is.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll assume that the response will be in the same JSON format, with ""accept"" being a boolean indicating whether Bob accepts the offer, and ""message"" being an optional field for any additional communication from Bob.)\n\n###\n\nExample response from Bob:\n\n{""accept"": false, ""message"": ""I want more""}\n\n###\n\nPlease go ahead and provide Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n\n###\n\n\n###\n\nI'm ready when you are!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm still aiming to get a larger share. Additionally, I know that the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round, so I'm hoping to use this to my advantage in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money to Bob.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when to send my next offer.\n\n###\n\n\n###\n\n\n###\n\nI'm ready when you are!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing value, I'm being generous""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, I'm taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round. I'm offering him $35, which is less than the $40 I offered in the first round, but still a significant amount considering the decreasing value of the money to him. My message is a bit cheeky, as I'm framing my offer as ""generous"" given the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nLet me know how Bob responds to this offer!"
