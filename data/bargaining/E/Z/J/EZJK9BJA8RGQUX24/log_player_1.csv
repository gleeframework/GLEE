"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. The inflation rate is significant, and rejecting this offer might lead to a worse outcome in future rounds. A 50/50 split guarantees a substantial amount, considering the dwindling value of the money."
