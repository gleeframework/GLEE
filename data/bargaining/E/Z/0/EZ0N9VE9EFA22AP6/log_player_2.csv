"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's see if we can find a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rates for both of us. Since Alice is affected more by inflation, I'll offer a bit more to her, but also keep in mind that I'm affected as well.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's find a middle ground that suits both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a bit more to account for the faster inflation hitting my share. This is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares, I believe we can still find a more balanced division that accounts for both of our losses over time. Alice's offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, so I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""Given the accelerating inflation impact, I'm willing to slightly increase my offer to find a mutually acceptable division, but I also need to protect my share's value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. I'm trying to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although Alice is trying to meet me halfway, the impact of inflation on both our shares has increased significantly. Given that my potential gain is now worth 34.39% less than initially, I believe we can still negotiate a better division that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value for both of us. I'll proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer, aiming to find a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both hard. Given the substantial decrease in value for both our shares, I'm willing to slightly increase my offer again to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I must ensure that my share remains reasonable considering the nearly 35% loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we both lose with every passing round. This is a compromise to end this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, with my potential gain now worth 46.86% less and Alice's gain worth 73.79% less than initially, I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise. The risk of proceeding to further rounds and potentially ending up with nothing due to the 12-round limit is substantial. Accepting this offer seems to be the most prudent decision at this point to ensure we both receive a share, despite the decreased value."
