"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair split, considering we're starting with 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair for Bob to take the majority of the money. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than 20 dollars. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but not all""}

I'm proposing that I get 40 dollars and Bob gets 60 dollars. I'm willing to give Bob the majority of the money, but I'm not willing to give him everything. I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling to accept this offer. 10 dollars is a very small share, and I think I can do better than that. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not willing to settle for such a small amount. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but not all""}

I'm proposing that I get 30 dollars and Bob gets 70 dollars. I'm trying to find a compromise that gives Bob a decent share, but not the majority. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
