I'll take 999,999 for myself and leave 1 dollar for Bob. This is a classic ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer. Let's see if he's willing to accept such a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. I am not willing to accept a mere $1. I will make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the significant inflation we've already experienced.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
