"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but since Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine, I want to maximize my gain in the first round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer.  While I could potentially get a slightly better deal in the next round,  the risk of Bob getting a much better deal (and the fact that I have no idea what his strategy is) makes it worthwhile to accept this offer."
