# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. But I was hoping to get a bit more. On the other hand, the money is worth less now, so I'll have to consider that.

I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money and the fact that the game is getting closer to its end.
