"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is incrementally reducing her demand, but it's still early in the game.  While her offer is closer to a ""fair"" split, I want to see if I can secure a slightly better deal in the next few rounds. The inflation isn't yet a massive factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This seems like a fair compromise, let's settle and avoid losing more to inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give up a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I might get if I reject and things go south in later rounds. Inflation is starting to eat into the potential gains, and risking a worse offer in later rounds with even less value due to inflation isn't wise."
