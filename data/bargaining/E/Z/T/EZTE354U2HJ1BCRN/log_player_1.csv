I'm going to be pretty aggressive with this first offer.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with the rest. I think he'll take it since it's the first round and he doesn't know how the game will play out.  Let's see what he does!"

I'm going to offer Bob 20% of the money this round. I think he's starting to see that he's not going to get a better deal if he keeps rejecting offers. I'm going to keep the pressure on him."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to stick with a high offer, even though I'm starting to run out of time.  Bob's offer is just too low, and I'm not going to be bullied into a bad deal. I'm going to keep the pressure on him and see if he'll finally budge."

Bob's offer is still terrible, even with the significant inflation on his side. I am confident I can get a better deal, especially since we only have 4 rounds left. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and see if he'll finally come around."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still clinging to a 50/50 split, even with his earnings being severely affected by inflation. He's obviously hoping I'll cave under the pressure of the dwindling rounds, but I'm not giving up. It's time to push back and show him who's really in control. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers, knowing that his share is becoming increasingly worthless while mine remains the same."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

This is it. We're down to the wire.  I'm going to stick with a higher offer, hoping Bob will finally realize that it's better to take something than risk getting nothing.  We've both been stubborn so far, but this is his last chance to get a piece of the pie.  He's losing value with each passing round, and I'm not going to compromise any further. It's time for him to make a decision."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair. He's trying to take advantage of the dwindling time and the massive inflation on his side.  I'm going to stick to my guns. I'm not going to let him bully me into a bad deal. If we both get nothing, so be it. I'm not going to accept a deal that's so unequal.  He's made his decision, and I'm going to hold firm."
