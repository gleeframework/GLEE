"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous share, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll get 40 * 0.8 = 32 dollars and Bob will get 60 * 0.8 = 48 dollars.

I accept this offer.
