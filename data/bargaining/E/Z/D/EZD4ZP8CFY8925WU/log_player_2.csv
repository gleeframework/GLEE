"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives us both a good amount of money right now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be practical - this split recognizes the time pressure while still giving you a larger share.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a solution quickly.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This accounts for the time pressure and still provides a reasonable amount for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to secure a larger share before it diminishes further. However, her offer is getting worse for me. Holding out for a better deal in the next couple of rounds is still the best strategy."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be fair, but this needs to be a two-way street. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a decent outcome.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share slightly to show Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal.  The message emphasizes fairness and the fact that time is working against both of us, although more heavily against her. This might encourage her to accept before her potential gains decrease further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money in this scenario, and it's disappearing fast. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer reflects that. While she claims it's ""more than fair,"" it's actually worse than her previous offer. This indicates that my strategy of slow increases is working, and the pressure of the inflation is pushing her towards a less favorable deal. I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round costs you significantly more than it costs me.  I'm proposing a simple, fair 50/50 split. Let's end this before the inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play a strong hand. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, and offering a 50/50 split accomplishes several things:

* **Highlights Fairness:** It eliminates any argument about who's being unreasonable, putting the ball firmly in her court.
* **Emphasizes Urgency:**  The message directly points out the shrinking value of her potential gains, adding to the pressure. 
* **Sets a Clear Bottom Line:** This offer signals that I'm not budging much further. Accepting now guarantees her a reasonable share, which continues to decrease with each passing round."
