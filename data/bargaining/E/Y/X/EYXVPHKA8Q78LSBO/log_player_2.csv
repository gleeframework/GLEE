Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 45

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer.  While time is running out, accepting a bad deal just means we both lose out on potential gains. I need to show her I'm serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking! This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law.  By mirroring Alice's previous offer but with the amounts flipped, I'm sending a clear message that I'm not going to be pushed around. This also gives her a taste of her own medicine, hopefully encouraging her to be more reasonable in future rounds."
