Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to take anything rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
This seems like a fair offer and I would rather get half the money than risk getting nothing."
