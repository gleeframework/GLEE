"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split, let's be reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I hope he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, how about a 55/45 split in my favor? Time is ticking and we both lose if this fails. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an offer that gives me less than half of the total amount, especially considering the unequal effect of inflation on our gains. It's my turn to make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 58-42 split. Inflation is costing me more than you""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob, but still trying to account for the uneven impact of inflation on our gains. Hope he'll consider it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation is hitting you harder, but I need a larger share. Let's compromise - 52/48? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50-50 split, I'm still not convinced it's fair considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains. I'll hold out for a better deal, hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""Getting desperate, but still need a fair share. 56-44 split, or we both lose big""
}
```

I'm making another concession, but trying to emphasize the urgency of the situation. If we don't reach an agreement soon, the inflation will eat away most of the value, and we'll both end up with very little. Hope Bob sees the sense in this!"
