"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start negotiating from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 80% of the original 5000 I proposed in the first round. That's a bit less than I initially wanted.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive move. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after your last offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the offer, my gain of 4500 is worth 45% of the original 5000 I proposed in the first round. That's a bit better than the 40% I would have gotten in the previous round, but still not ideal.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive and take advantage of the fact that the money is still worth less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, I think I deserve the majority of the pie""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I think I deserve more than that, let's keep negotiating 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain of 3000 is worth a mere 30% of the original 5000 I proposed in the first round. That's a significant drop.

However, I'm not sure if I should take this offer or risk waiting for a better one. Considering the message, Bob seems to be willing to keep negotiating, so I might be able to get a better deal in the next round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make one final push for a better deal. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll aim for a compromise. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's end this and split it fairly""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution."
