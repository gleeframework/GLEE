Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your initial proposal, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reasonable considering the inflation rate. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
