"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we should settle on this division to avoid losing value due to inflation in subsequent rounds. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a better deal to make it worthwhile. This is my offer. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because it's heavily skewed in his favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Although the money's value decreases due to inflation, I'm willing to take that risk to potentially secure a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Given the decreasing value of money due to inflation, it's essential to find a mutually acceptable agreement quickly. My message, ""Meet me in the middle,"" aims to convey a sense of compromise, as I'm willing to decrease my share from the initial offer in round 1 to find a middle ground. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'm meeting you closer to the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer has improved, and he's meeting me closer to the middle, I'll reject this offer. The money's value is decreasing significantly for me (48.8% less than the initial round), but I believe there's still room for negotiation. Considering the difference in inflation rates, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair deal""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $480,000 and keep $520,000 for myself. Given the rapidly decreasing value of money due to inflation, it's crucial to reach an agreement soon. My message, ""Last chance for a fair deal,"" aims to convey a sense of urgency and emphasize that I'm still willing to offer a relatively fair split. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider taking a more significant risk in the next rounds. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money. I'm making a final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (67.23% less than the initial round for me), I'll accept Bob's offer. Although it's not the most favorable split, the risk of proceeding to the next rounds and potentially getting nothing outweighs the potential benefits. Bob's message also suggests that he's unlikely to make further concessions. By accepting this offer, I'll secure $450,000, which, although reduced in value, is still a significant amount. It's time to conclude the game and minimize further losses."
