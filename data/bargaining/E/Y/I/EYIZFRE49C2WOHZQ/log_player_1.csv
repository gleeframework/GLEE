  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's just divide it fairly""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a bit worse for me than my previous offer, and the inflation has reduced the value of the money Bob gains even more. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
