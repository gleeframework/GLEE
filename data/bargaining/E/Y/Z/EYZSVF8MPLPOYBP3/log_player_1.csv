"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob only 10%. I'm trying to maximize my gain in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less for Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it gives me 250,000, I know that Bob's offer is driven by the fact that the money is worth less to him.  I'm betting that I can get a better deal in the next round as the inflation will continue to impact Bob's gain more significantly than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  The inflation is starting to hit him hard, and I believe this offer is still favorable enough for him to avoid another round."
