"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Take 200k and let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering we have 11 more rounds to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 40% and leave you with 60%. It's a fair start, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the 10% reduction in value due to inflation, $600,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the previous round. That's $540,000.

I'm not sure if 40% is a fair share, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 32% for me, 68% for you. We're getting closer to a deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $680,000 is worth 73.9% of the original $1,000,000 (since 100% - 26.1% = 73.9%).
Bob's gain of $320,000 is worth 86.74% of the original $1,000,000 (since 100% - 13.26% = 86.74%).

Considering the values, I'm not sure if 32% is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

I'm making a bold move, offering Bob a tiny share of $100,000, while keeping the majority of the money for myself. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will take it. Let's see if he accepts this one!"
