"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a counteroffer. Let me think for a moment...

I'm not sure I like this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more than 450,000$. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and having to deal with even more inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
