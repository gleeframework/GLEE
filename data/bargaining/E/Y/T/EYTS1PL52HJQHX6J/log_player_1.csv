"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split the money 60/40. A deal now is better than risking inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to act quickly against inflation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fair offer considering the inflation rate affects me more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting both of us. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. This offer ensures we both secure a decent share before inflation eats away at it further.""}"
