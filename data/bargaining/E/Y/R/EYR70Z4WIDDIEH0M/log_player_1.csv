"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, but it's closer to an equal split than my previous offer.

I'll accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
