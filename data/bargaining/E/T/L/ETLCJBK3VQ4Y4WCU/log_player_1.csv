"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leaving 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll consider it. Since my gain is still 49 dollars, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is 51 dollars, which is 5% less than the 54 dollars he would have gotten in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
