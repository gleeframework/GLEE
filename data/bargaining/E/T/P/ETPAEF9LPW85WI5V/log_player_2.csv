Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is biting, and we're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  It gives us both a decent share before the money dwindles further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
