Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is losing value on the potential money rapidly (almost 60% less than round 1).  
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively worse for Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a high chance Alice will offer even less next round, and the inflation will make the difference even more significant. 

While Bob could gamble on Alice becoming more generous, the risk of getting a much worse deal is too high with the relentless inflation working against him."
