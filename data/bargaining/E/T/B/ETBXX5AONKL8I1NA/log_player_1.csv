Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling to accept this offer, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money. The 30/70 split is too lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity in the split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm getting desperate, and the risk of not getting anything if we don't agree soon is becoming more real. Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer and take the 25/75 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game."
