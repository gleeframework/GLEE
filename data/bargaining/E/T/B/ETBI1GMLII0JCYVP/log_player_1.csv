"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and leave 40% ($400,000) for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer of $450,000 for me is lower than what I initially proposed for myself ($600,000), and I'm only willing to compromise so much. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the effects of inflation on both of our gains. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, I'll propose a slightly lower amount for myself ($580,000) and a slightly higher amount for Bob ($420,000) compared to my initial offer. This way, we can both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" indicates my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution."
