"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to set the tone for the game and give me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and equal start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll be gaining $5000 instead of $8000.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable one. However, considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since I'll be gaining $5000, which is 50% of the total, I'll have to consider the fact that this amount will be worth less in the future due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
