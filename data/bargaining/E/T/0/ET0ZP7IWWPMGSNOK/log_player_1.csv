"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is still bigger, but let's be a bit more realistic. This offer won't be on the table for long! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm thinking... Bob's offer is a bit better for him now, and it seems like he's trying to pressure me. However, I still hold some power as the value decreases for me with each round, making his potential future offers less appealing.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This offer is a nudge towards a more even split while acknowledging the time pressure.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice! This is my final offer. You're losing more with every round we waste. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to consider a few things:

* **Time pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and Bob is clearly aware of the time pressure. He's framed this as his ""final offer,"" which may or may not be true.
* **Diminishing returns:** While 52 isn't ideal, waiting any longer will significantly decrease the value of any potential gains for me.  
* **Bob's strategy:** Bob seems to be slowly increasing his share, betting on my impatience. 

While it's frustrating, accepting now might be the most logical choice to avoid walking away with even less.
