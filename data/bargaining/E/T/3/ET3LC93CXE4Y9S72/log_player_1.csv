Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair, and avoids the risk of losing value with each passing round. Let's reach an agreement and secure our share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing money with each round. Let's find a compromise closer to a 50/50 split. I'm willing to meet you halfway at 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you. It's a fairer offer considering the inflation rate, and it gives us both a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable split, it's still advantageous for me to hold out a little longer. The inflation disproportionately affects him, making him more likely to concede a larger share to me in the next round to avoid further losses."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I've adjusted my offer slightly. It's crucial to remember the money loses value with each round, especially for you. This offer still ensures you get a good amount, and we avoid further losses.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. We're both losing money, and this gap between our offers is unsustainable. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 475,000 for me and 525,000 for you. This acknowledges the inflation difference and gives us both a decent share before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally making concessions that reflect the urgency of the situation. While I might be able to squeeze a bit more in the next round or two, there's a risk he'll become more resistant to concessions if I push too hard. Accepting this offer guarantees a good share of the money without risking everything by pushing him too far."
