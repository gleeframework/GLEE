Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very unequal offer, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it quickly before the money loses much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer. Although it's still a very unequal split, I'd rather get 10,000 now than risk getting nothing at all if we keep playing and the money keeps devaluing."
