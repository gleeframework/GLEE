"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's split it 40-60, a fair starting point""}

I'm offering Bob 60% of the initial 100$, which is 60, and I'll take the remaining 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, hoping we can come to an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give me a good deal yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 65 for him and 35 for me, I'll try to increase the amount I'm asking for.

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it, considering we're getting closer to the deadline."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided! I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him 70% of the money. I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 70% of the money. How about 42 for me and 58 for you?""}"
