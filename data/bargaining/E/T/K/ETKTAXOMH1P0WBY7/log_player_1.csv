I propose a 90/10 split.  I'm willing to take the larger share, but I want to leave something for Bob as well.  This feels like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, it's still not worth accepting such a drastic drop in my share.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split.  I'm still taking a big chunk, but I'm willing to give Bob a larger portion this round. I think this is a reasonable compromise given the inflation we've both experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'm taking a significant hit due to inflation, a 450,000 gain is still a decent amount, and it's likely I won't get a better deal in the next round."
