"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I believe I deserve a bit more since I'm making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round.  I think 60-40 is a fair split, but I'm open to negotiating further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway on the split difference""
}
```

I've reduced my gain by 20,000 from the initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. Let's see if this is more acceptable to him."
