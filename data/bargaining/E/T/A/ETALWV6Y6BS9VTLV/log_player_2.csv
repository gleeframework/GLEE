Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my gains are diminishing each round, hers remain the same. I need to remain firm to get a reasonable deal. Accepting $350,000 now would be a significant loss compared to what I could have had in earlier rounds. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as the game progresses."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is the same offer you gave me in Round 1.  Accept this and we both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a tactical retreat. Alice is being incredibly stubborn, likely banking on my fear of inflation to force a bad deal.  By offering her the same terms she proposed initially, I'm calling her bluff. She gets no better deal than before, and I minimize further losses to inflation. It's a gamble, but hopefully, it makes her realize I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time's running out, Bob! You're losing value fast! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I'm backed into a corner.  Alice is playing hardball, and the relentless inflation is eroding my potential gains with each passing round. While $300,000 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer risks an even worse outcome in Round 8. I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, but it's a gamble I'm no longer in a position to take. It's better to walk away with something than risk getting even less."
