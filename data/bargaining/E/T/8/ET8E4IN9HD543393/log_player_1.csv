"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, and I'll take $700,000. It's a pretty generous offer, considering the inflation will make the money worth less with each passing round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob made the same offer as I did in the first round!

I'll reject this offer as well. The money is still worth the same for me, but it's worth 10% less for Bob, so I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less than the previous round, and another 10% less from the first round), I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob made another offer that's similar to the previous ones. However, since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob now, I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth the same for me, but 27.1% less for Bob, I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but it's still a decent offer considering the inflation."
