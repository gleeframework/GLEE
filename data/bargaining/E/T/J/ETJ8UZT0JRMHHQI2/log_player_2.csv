"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40. I think it's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to be greedy. 60/40 is a good start, but I want more. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think 70/30 is a fair deal.  It's my turn to be greedy now!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but 45/55 feels fairer to me.  Let's end this before we both lose more money! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep pushing for a bigger share, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  This is a decent compromise, and I'm sure we'll both lose more money if we keep playing. Let's end this."
