"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 30%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $50 gain is now worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's $50 gain is worth 90% of its original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
