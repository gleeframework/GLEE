"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable and fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time. I propose 55/45, a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider whether 45 is a good enough offer for me. Since I'm not sure about the inflation rate affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's try 58/42!""
}
```"
