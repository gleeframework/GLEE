"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant share of the money upfront. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, this offer is actually more favorable to me than the previous one.

I accept the offer.
