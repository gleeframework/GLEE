  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake on it.""

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
