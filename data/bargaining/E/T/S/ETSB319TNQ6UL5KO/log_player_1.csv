"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'd rather not give up 70% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 20% inflation), I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This way, I'll get 48% of the remaining value, and Bob will get 52%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Considering the money is worth 16.8% of its original value (due to four rounds of 20% inflation), I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's a relatively close split, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 13.44% of its original value now (due to five rounds of 20% inflation). I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40.32% of the remaining value, and Bob will get 36.32%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll now!

Considering the money is worth 3.32% of its original value (due to six rounds of 20% inflation), I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's a relatively close split, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. However, the value of the money is getting so low that I'm starting to think it's time to accept a decent offer.

I'll accept this offer.
