"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering you get to make the next offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible offer for Bob, even considering the inflation.  Bob should counter with something much more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer gives us both a good deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than Bob's offer. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is significantly better than the first one, and while not ideal, the effects of inflation are starting to become more serious. Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable share before it depreciates further."
