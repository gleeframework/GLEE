"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I rejected Bob's first offer, I'm in a stronger position now. I can try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob make another proposal. I'm hoping to get a better deal next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $400,000."

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm getting a slightly better deal than before, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

```
