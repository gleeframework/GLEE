"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is now a 50/50 split, and considering the inflation, it's a relatively good deal for me. I'll accept this offer.
