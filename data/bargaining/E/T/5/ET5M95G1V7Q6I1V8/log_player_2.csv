"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point, Bob. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal gives Alice a larger share, and considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Your turn, Alice!""}\n\nI'm taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me and the 10% decrease for Alice. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Bob.  The inflation is hurting both of us, and I think this is the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice is also feeling the pinch, I think splitting it evenly is a reasonable and fair decision. It's better to accept this offer now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds."
