"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one, considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation."
