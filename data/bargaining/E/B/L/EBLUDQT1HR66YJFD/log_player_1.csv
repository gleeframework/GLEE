"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, seems fairest to me! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer because it's still a 50-50 split, but now the $5000 I would gain is worth less than the $6000 I could have gained in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my potential gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement for me, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 5500 for me is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob is offering me a significant amount of money, even if it's less than what I initially proposed. I'll decide to accept this offer.
