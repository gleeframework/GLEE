"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it quickly. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that offer! Even with inflation, I'm sure I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to try and be more appealing to Bob. Inflation is a factor, but I believe I can still secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite, but I still believe I can do better. I'm going to reject and see what Bob offers next round.  I'm starting to think he might be trying to take advantage of the situation, but I won't let him!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a decent share. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement before inflation takes a bigger bite out of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is really hurting me now, but I'm not going to accept this offer. I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm starting to think Bob might be trying to take advantage of the situation, but I won't let him! I'm going to keep fighting for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. With inflation hitting so hard, I think it's the best deal I can get at this point. It's a fair compromise and hopefully, Bob will see that."
