"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll start by proposing a division that seems reasonable to me. I'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting fairness. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be more even this time. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to be more even this time, I believe I can get a better deal considering the inflation factor that affects Bob's gain but not mine. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the inflation factor that affects Bob's gain. Given that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each subsequent round, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this. By proposing $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob, I'm effectively offering Bob a slightly better deal in real terms than in the previous round, while also considering my own interests. Let's see how Bob responds!"
