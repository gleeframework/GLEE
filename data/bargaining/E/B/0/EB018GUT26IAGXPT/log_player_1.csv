"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! Your turn to respond.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, let's end it here! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is matching my initial offer!

Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:
- Alice's gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
- Bob's gain: 50

Since I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob's end, I'll assume it's the same as mine. This means Bob's gain is actually 50 * (1 - 0.05) = 47.5 as well.

I'm happy with this 50-50 split, considering the inflation. I accept the offer!
