Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with each round, so let's just split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Explanation: 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 3 is better than risking further inflation. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might propose an even less favorable split. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, while not matching Bob's initial goal, is objectively fair.
