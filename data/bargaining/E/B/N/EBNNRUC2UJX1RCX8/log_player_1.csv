Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, knowing that each round will devalue the money more for Bob than for me."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time. With only a few rounds remaining, I believe this is the fairest split considering the inflation rate. It's a decent amount for Bob, and it secures a majority for me before the value of the money depreciates even further."
