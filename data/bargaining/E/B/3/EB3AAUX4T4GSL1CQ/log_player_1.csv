"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain of $9,000 in the first round is now worth $8,100.

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the effective amount is $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm still optimistic we can end this game soon.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500 and keeping $7,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's get closer to a deal! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the effective amount is now $7,300.

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. A 60/40 split is a good compromise, and I'd rather settle for this than continue negotiating."
