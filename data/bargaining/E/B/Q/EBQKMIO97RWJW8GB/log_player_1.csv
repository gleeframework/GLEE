Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Inflation will eat away at the value of the money if we keep rejecting.  It's better to take $1,000 now than risk getting nothing."
