"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, giving you a small token of appreciation for playing this game with me. Let's make it quick and easy!

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This reflects that I'm taking on more risk with inflation.  A fair deal for both of us, don't you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here, Bob. 50/50 is the fairest split considering the inflation affecting you. Let's end this before things get even worse! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, accepting a 50/50 split now means I'm losing out on potential gains from earlier rounds. I need to apply more pressure and make it clear that accepting a less favorable deal now is still better for her than risking larger losses later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we are both losing money with every passing round. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still a significant amount for you. Let's avoid further losses and come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and has shifted to offering me a larger percentage.  Rejecting this shows I'm serious and willing to risk it for a more favorable outcome."
