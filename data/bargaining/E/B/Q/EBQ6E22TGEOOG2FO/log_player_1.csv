"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm proposing to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing to take 600,000$ and give Bob 400,000$. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further if necessary.  I am aware of the inflation, and I'm trying to make sure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation makes it increasingly difficult to get a better deal. Accepting this offer secures at least some money, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all."
