"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now, and I'm offering a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. The inflation is going to hurt both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! I'm not sure I'm ready to split it evenly just yet, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm holding out for a better deal, hoping that the inflation will continue to erode Bob's gains and make my share more valuable in the long run!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain! Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less now, and I'm offering a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll cave in!"
