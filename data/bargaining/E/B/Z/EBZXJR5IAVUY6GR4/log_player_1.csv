"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority but you'll get a decent chunk too.""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% and Bob getting 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up too much, but a 50/50 split is a decent compromise. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
