"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see where it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about my next move.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $3000, but I'm willing to negotiate further as Bob suggested.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. With the 5% inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking to get a larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth 14.26% less than the original, I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $4500, but it's a slightly better deal than before. I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating, but I'm willing to give Bob another chance.
