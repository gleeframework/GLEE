"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get more than half of the money to make up for the loss in value.\n\nAlso, I'm curious to see how Alice will react if I reject her offer. Will she make a more generous offer in the next round, or will she try to lowball me? Let's find out!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the 20% decrease in value for me and the 5% decrease for Alice. I'll also include a message to try to persuade Alice to accept my offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}"
