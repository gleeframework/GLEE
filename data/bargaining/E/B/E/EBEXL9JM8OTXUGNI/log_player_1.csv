"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'd get 40% of the money, but due to inflation, it's worth 10% less than the 60% I was initially offered. So, I'd get 40% of the original 100, which is 40, but it's worth 90% of that, which is 36.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
