"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's not forget that the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I think this offer is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's important to remember that every round makes a huge difference for me due to the inflation. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of potential gain. I need to push for a more balanced deal while keeping the dwindling time in mind."
