"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, given the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 52-48 split, considering the inflation factor""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, with me getting $5,200 and Bob getting $4,800."
