Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, 55-45 is more than generous considering the circumstances. Don't let inflation win! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating away at the potential gains so rapidly. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking even lower returns in future rounds."
