"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll consider this offer.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not that big!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly bigger share, but I'm not willing to give him the entire 6,000 he was asking for. I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is still a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! The money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, but he's still asking for a huge share. I'm not comfortable with this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a new proposal that's more balanced.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50/50 split, it's still a fair deal!""}

I'm proposing to go back to the original 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable proposal. The money is worth less now, but I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."
