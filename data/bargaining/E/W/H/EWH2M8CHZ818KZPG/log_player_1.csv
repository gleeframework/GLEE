"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think you can do better 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is worth 95% of the original $5000, which is $4,750. That's a decent offer, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the $10,000 is now worth $9,500. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the value""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think you're still holding back too much 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I would gain in this offer. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the $10,000 is now worth $8,615.60. The $3800 I would gain is worth 38% of the original $10,000, which is $3,800.

This offer is actually better than my previous one, and considering the inflation, I think it's a good deal. I'll accept it.
