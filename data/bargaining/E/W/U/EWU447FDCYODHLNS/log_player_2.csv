"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob and I'm going to try to get a better deal!  I'll wait to see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think it's only fair that I get a bit more this round since you got the better end of the deal last time.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 50/50 this round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 50/50 split now.  The inflation is going to continue to hurt me more than Alice, and if I reject, we'll just keep going back and forth."
