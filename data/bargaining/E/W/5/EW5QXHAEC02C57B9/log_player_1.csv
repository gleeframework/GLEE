"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message to Bob is that I think we can split the money fairly and there's no need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up that much. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering a 54-46 split, with me getting $5,400 and Bob getting $4,600. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than what he's offering."
