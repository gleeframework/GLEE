"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair and square deal, but I'm sure Bob might not agree!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 60%. I'll wait for another round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still a fair split!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% of the remaining $100, and leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a bit more generous than his previous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the back-and-forth we've had so far. I'm glad we could meet in the middle!"
