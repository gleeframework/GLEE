"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair considering the risk of inflation. This gives you a significant share while still leaving me with a decent amount to compensate for potential future devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
