"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of you, Bob. This offers a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 70/30 split is generous, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially considering the risk of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair considering the risk of inflation. This gives you a significant share while still leaving me with a decent amount to compensate for potential future devaluation.""
