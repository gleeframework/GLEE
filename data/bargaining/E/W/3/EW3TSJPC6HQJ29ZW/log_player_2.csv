Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Even though the money is losing value, Alice is still consistently offering deals where she gets significantly more. While time is a factor, accepting a bad deal just to avoid getting nothing is not in Bob's best interest. There's still a chance to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to play a strong hand.  While getting slightly above 50% would be ideal, the longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for Bob. A firm offer of a 50/50 split might be enough to get Alice to agree before the effects of inflation worsen, especially with the ""take it or leave it"" message adding a sense of urgency."
