"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves a decent amount for Bob. This way, I can see if he's willing to accept a slightly unfair deal in the first round, or if he's more likely to hold out for a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better for me than the previous round, but it's still not fair. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to increase my share slightly, but still offer Bob a decent portion.  I believe this is a fair compromise, especially given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse due to inflation.  While it's tempting to take something, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a compromise.  This is a fair split considering the inflation, and it gives Bob a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has significantly lowered the value of my potential gains, Bob's offer is finally fair.  It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the limited time remaining.  It's time to accept and secure at least something."
