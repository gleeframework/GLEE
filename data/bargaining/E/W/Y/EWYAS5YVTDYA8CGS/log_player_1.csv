Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a significant portion, but I think 40 is a fair share for me, considering the initial offer was 20. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
