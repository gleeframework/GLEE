Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, this is a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While getting a 38/62 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** If I reject this offer and we go to Round 6, the value of my potential gain will decrease even further due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice knows time is on her side. She's unlikely to offer a significantly better deal, especially as my bargaining power weakens with each round.

It's a tough choice, but taking the current offer cuts my losses and avoids the risk of walking away with even less."
