"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Bob. This might seem like a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation rates. It's a 60/40 split in favor of Bob, but it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
