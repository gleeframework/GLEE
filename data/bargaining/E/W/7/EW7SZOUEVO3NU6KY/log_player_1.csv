"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, while still offering Bob something. It's a good starting point and allows us to see if Bob is willing to accept a less-than-equal share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer gives me a substantial amount of money, and it's important to remember that inflation means my share is worth less with each round.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive a significant portion of the money."
