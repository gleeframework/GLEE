"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. I figure a 90/10 split is a good starting point, giving Bob a decent amount while ensuring I get the majority.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take 100,000, remember the value is decreasing each round.  I'll stick to my strategy and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to reduce my proposed share by 50,000, but offer Bob a slightly higher portion.  This is a fair compromise to see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm confident that we can get this done in this round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While it's significantly less than my initial proposal, the value of the money is dropping rapidly.  It's better to secure some profit now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
