"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than half of the money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
