"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain would be $665,000, and Bob's gain would be $475,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to make this work.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain would be $857,000 in the first round, but now it's worth 85.74% of that, which is approximately $732,144. 

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise considering the situation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's settle on this. It's a fair split.""
}
```"
