"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the total amount is now 100 * 0.95 = 95$.

I'm considering Bob's offer, which is a 50-50 split. This seems like a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a better deal for myself. 55-45 is the best I can do.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think 55 is fair 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's trying to turn the tables on me!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the total amount is now 100 * 0.8526 = 85.26$.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. 45 for me is a bit less than my previous offer of 55, but it's still a decent amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to let Bob get the upper hand. Since I rejected his offer, I'll make a new one that's even more favorable to myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns. 60-40 is a fair deal, and I'm not budging.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging either, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like we're stuck in a cycle! 

Since the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, the total amount is now 100 * 0.7778 = 77.78$.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting 40, but I'm not sure if I should keep pushing for more. Meeting in the middle might be a good way to end the game and avoid further losses due to inflation.
