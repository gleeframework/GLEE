"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. You get 40% and I get 60%. This seems like a good deal for you considering the money will be worth less if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than half the money right away, especially when the value of the money is going to decrease for Alice. I'm going to see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest deal and we can both get the most out of it before the money loses value.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to split evenly, but the value decreases for me each round. I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's do 65/35 and end this. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with a deal where I get less than half.  I'm going to hold out for a better offer.  The money may be losing value, but it's still worth more to me than a significantly smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get significantly less than half.  Let's split it 55/45. This is a fairer deal that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for you while still giving me a reasonable share.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Let's be sensible and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The money is losing value, but I'm not going to accept less than half. I'm hoping Alice will realize that it's in her best interest to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running low on time. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than 40% to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40, considering the significant value loss you're experiencing. It's the best we can do at this point.""}
