"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly generous offer. I'm willing to take a bigger share, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. 1000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping Alice will increase her offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the difference. I think this is a fair offer considering the money is worth less to me with each passing round.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less to me in each round, I want to try to end the game as soon as possible. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a fair offer and accept it, considering that she doesn't lose any value in the money."
