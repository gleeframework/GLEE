"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can avoid any potential disputes. What do you think, Bob?"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400,000, but I think I deserve more. You can try to do better. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 400,000 is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer I made was 500,000, and Bob's share was the same. I'll try to do better next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal than the initial 50/50 split, while still being reasonable and leaving room for negotiation. What do you think, Bob?"

# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is almost worthless at this point, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the negotiation.

I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I suppose it's better to accept the offer and get something than to risk getting nothing at all. 500,000 is a decent share, and it's better than what I would get if we go to the next round and the money loses even more value."
