"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $400,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fairer reflection of our respective contributions. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I don't think this is a very clever move, Bob. I was trying to be generous in round 1, and now you're trying to take advantage of me?

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my side of the negotiations so far.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which is $550,000, and leaving Bob with 45%, or $450,000. My message is a bit more assertive this time, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much."
