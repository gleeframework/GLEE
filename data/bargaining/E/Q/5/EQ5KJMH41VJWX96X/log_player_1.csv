"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to make an offer. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'm not as concerned about the absolute value of the amount. However, I still think I deserve a better share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I think I deserve more considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm trying to be more generous this time, but still prioritize my own gain given the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer again, but I'm getting desperate. The money is worth a lot less for me now, and I need to make the most of it. I'll have to consider this offer carefully.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
