"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair deal? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. I know Alice's money is worth less each round, so I can probably get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little less than half, but I think it's a fair deal since my money is worth more now.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle. This offer takes into account the inflation, but still gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though it's less than what I initially proposed, the inflation is working against Alice, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
