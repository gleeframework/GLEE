"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob is willing to accept a very small amount. After all, the money will be worth more to me than him in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me a much larger share than my initial offer, it's still not worth it to me in the long run. I know that Bob's money will be worth significantly less in the next round due to the inflation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still a significantly smaller share than what he offered me. Since the money is worth less to him with each round, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid getting an even worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This time I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is really hurting Bob.  He's already lost a lot of value, and it will continue to decrease with each round.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, I'll get a worse deal in the next round.  It's time to take what I can get."
