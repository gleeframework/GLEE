Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, considering the inflation. You're getting the better end of the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While this offer isn't ideal, considering the inflation I'm facing, I'm better off accepting it than risking another round where I might get even less."
