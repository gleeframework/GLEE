"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. I'm aiming for a large share in the first round to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still a significant gain for me, especially considering the inflation factor for Bob. It's better to accept now than risk losing more in the next round."
