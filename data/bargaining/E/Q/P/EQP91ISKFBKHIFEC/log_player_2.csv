Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share than before, but I still need a good amount.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

This offer is worse than Alice's first offer, and the clock is ticking. I need to incentivize her to be more reasonable."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. We're both losing out with every round. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. We can both walk away with something, instead of risking getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. It's getting too risky now. While I'd prefer a larger share, getting half is better than getting nothing if the negotiations fail."
