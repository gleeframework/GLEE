"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a generous and reasonable starting point for our negotiations. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. 55/45? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept 45% of the total amount, especially since the money is worth 20% less to me now. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.""
}


I've reduced my initial offer, but I still believe I should receive the larger portion of the money. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice.  This is a fair deal, let's close it out: 52/48 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting 48% of the original amount is a reasonable decision at this point. Further negotiations might not lead to a better outcome, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
