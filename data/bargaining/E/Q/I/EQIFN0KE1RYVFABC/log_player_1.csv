"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
