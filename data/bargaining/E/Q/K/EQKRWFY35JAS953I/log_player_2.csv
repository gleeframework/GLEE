Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split accounts for the time value of money. Let's close the deal now and both benefit.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Take it before the money devalues further! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, my offer is relatively better each round. Don't wait! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right about the impact of inflation, her offers are getting progressively worse for me. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I also need to be mindful of the shrinking pot. The next offer should be my turning point to signal I'm willing to negotiate a more realistic split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting me, but dragging this out hurts us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being generous considering the circumstances. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but with every round, the value diminishes significantly for me. Alice is unlikely to agree to a 50/50 split, and waiting any longer will result in even less favorable outcomes. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
