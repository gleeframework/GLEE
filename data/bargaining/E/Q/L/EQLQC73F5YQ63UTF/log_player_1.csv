"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and I got 600,000 in the first round, I'll get 600,000 * 0.9 = 540,000 in the second round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for 500,000, which is more than what I would get in the next round.
