Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. Let's end this quickly and avoid any further risk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
