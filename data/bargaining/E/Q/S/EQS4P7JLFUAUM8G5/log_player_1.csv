"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40, which is a reasonable amount, and I'll take $60. The message ""Let's be fair"" is to convey that the offer is reasonable and that we should end the game early to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair. This offer won't be as good later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, he will be more inclined to accept a lower offer as the game progresses. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's end this before it's too late""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $42, which is slightly less than my initial offer, but still a reasonable amount. The message ""Let's end this before it's too late"" is to convey that we should end the game soon to avoid losing value due to inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less in each round, he may be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal. Let's stop wasting time and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can still get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth even less for Bob now (27.1% less than in the first round), he will be more desperate to accept a lower offer as the game progresses. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a counteroffer in the next round. Additionally, Bob's message seems to convey a sense of urgency, which makes me think he's getting anxious to end the game, and I can use this to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Last chance before I get greedy""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $43, which is slightly less than my previous offer. The message ""Last chance before I get greedy"" is to convey that I'm willing to make a reasonable offer now, but if Bob rejects it, I'll make much lower offers in the future. Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, he may be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk getting an even worse deal later. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and make Bob think that this is the best offer he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because I think it's the best deal I can get. Bob's message seems sincere, and he's right that the offer is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, he's already losing a significant amount of value, and I don't think he'll be willing to go much lower. Additionally, Bob's message states that this is his final offer, which makes me think he's willing to walk away if I reject it. I don't want to risk getting nothing, so I'll accept this offer.
