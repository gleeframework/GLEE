Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better if we split the money more evenly. Let's try a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 55/45, with me taking the larger share this time. We're losing value with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing a tough game, but this offer is still unacceptable. He's essentially asking for the same split he proposed in Round 2, which was already unfavorable to me even before more inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal. The decreasing value puts pressure on both of us."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. Any more delays and we both lose.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the money is decreasing, but I still believe a 55/45 split is more equitable. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for less than 5500. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is tough, but the clock is ticking. The value of the money is significantly lower now. If I reject this offer and Bob doesn't offer a better deal in the next few rounds, I risk ending up with even less."
