I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself.  There are a lot of rounds left and I can likely do better."

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better if we split the money more evenly. Let's try a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share this time.""}

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is getting more greedy, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll keep trying to negotiate a more favorable split for myself."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While a 50/50 split is fair, there's still time for me to try and get a slightly larger share. The value of the money is decreasing, but I think I can still get a better outcome for myself."
