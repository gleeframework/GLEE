"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of my potential gain in this round is 90% of $400,000, which is $360,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
