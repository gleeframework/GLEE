Let's see how Bob reacts to this generous (for him) offer!  ðŸ˜„"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

I'm still holding out for more.  Bob is getting a better deal with each round, but I'm not giving in yet.  Let's see what he offers next."

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still aiming for the lion's share.  Let's see if this is enough to convince him."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  Even though Bob is getting a better deal with each round,  I'm starting to see the value of getting some money now, rather than potentially getting nothing later.  I'll take the 800,000 and call it a day."
