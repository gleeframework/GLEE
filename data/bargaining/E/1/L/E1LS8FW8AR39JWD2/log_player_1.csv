"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $600,000 and Bob would get $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fair split, considering our different rates of inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, Bob's offer is actually a 55.56-44.44 split in his favor, not 60-40. I'll accept his offer.
