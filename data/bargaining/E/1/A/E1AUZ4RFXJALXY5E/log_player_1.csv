"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, with me getting 80 dollars and Bob getting 20 dollars. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this a bit closer to the middle. This is my first offer, but we can discuss further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 45 dollars is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 42.75 dollars.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too close to the middle for my liking. I'd like to try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting that we continue negotiating. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my gain of 50 dollars is equivalent to 47.5 dollars.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slight edge for taking on more risk in this negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, but with a slight bias towards me getting a bit more. My message is a friendly but assertive one, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise but want to get a slightly better deal."
