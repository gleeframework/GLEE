# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the amount I'll gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for me, Bob. I'm looking for a bigger share. Let's keep negotiating!""
