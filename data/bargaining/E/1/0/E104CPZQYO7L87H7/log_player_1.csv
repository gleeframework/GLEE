"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start by offering a large majority of the money to myself (90%) in the hopes that Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly.  The inflation factor makes it risky to wait too long, as the value of the money could erode."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though the inflation factor is now affecting Bob's gains, I'm still in a position of power. I can likely get a better deal by continuing to play the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to offer slightly less than Bob's offer in the previous round. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a significant majority of the money. The inflation factor is now present, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing if the game goes on for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While the inflation factor is heavily affecting Bob's gains, I'm still getting a significant share of the money.  With the inflation rate increasing with each round, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep playing and risk getting nothing.  It's time to secure a decent payout."
