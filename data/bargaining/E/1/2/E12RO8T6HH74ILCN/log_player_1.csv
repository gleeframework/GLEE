Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but that's not fair considering the inflation working against you. How about we try a 55/45 split? It's a much better deal for you in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
