"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This is a fairly even split, and it might encourage Bob to accept the offer in the first round. It's a good starting point to see how Bob values the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, considering the inflation rate, my gains would be significantly reduced if we continue. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent outcome."
