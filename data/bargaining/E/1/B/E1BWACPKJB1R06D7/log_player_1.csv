# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair compromise""}

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is losing value quickly! With the offer being 14.26% less than the original, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

While I'm not thrilled with the offer, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and the decreasing value of the money. I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
