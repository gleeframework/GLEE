Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rates and the diminishing value of money in future rounds, I propose an equal split of $100, both for us. This ensures a fair division while accounting for the economic conditions. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
