"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what kind of offer Alice will give next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money is dropping. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money. This offer is still good for you, even considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though it's less than I initially wanted, it's still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
