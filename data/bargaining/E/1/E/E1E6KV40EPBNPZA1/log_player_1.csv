Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This ensures a good starting point for me, and allows Bob to see that I'm willing to be generous, while still prioritizing my own interests.  I'll be interested to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal. While I understand the impact of inflation, I'm not willing to accept a loss of 8000 dollars just because of a single round of negotiation. I believe I can do better in the next round, especially as the inflation is affecting Bob's side now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer by 1000 dollars, but I still believe this is a fair proposal, considering Bob's loss in the previous round due to inflation. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob that accepting a deal is better than risking further inflation in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly in his favor, even with the inflation affecting him. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss, especially since my gains have remained stable. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round, and I'm confident that Bob will be more willing to negotiate as the rounds go on and the inflation continues to affect him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm decreasing my offer again, but still maintaining a significant portion of the money. With inflation continuing to impact Bob, I believe this offer will be more appealing than risking further losses in future rounds.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept a deal and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer, while slightly better than the previous one, still doesn't offer me a fair share. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round, and I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that it's better to reach an agreement now rather than risk further losses due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split this round. I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need to secure a significant share for myself. Inflation is starting to hit Bob hard, and I believe this offer is a good compromise for both of us. It's time for Bob to consider the long-term implications of further rounds and risk losing even more due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired split, it's still not enough. With each round, inflation continues to hurt him, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the coming rounds. I'm not willing to settle for a 4000/6000 split, especially as Bob's losses continue to increase.  I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round, and I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that it's better to reach an agreement now rather than risk further losses due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this round. I believe it's time for us to come to a fair and equitable solution. With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money for Bob, the risk of losing even more is significant. This 50/50 split ensures that we both receive a reasonable amount, and it minimizes the potential for further losses. I believe this is the most sensible solution, and I hope Bob will finally see the value in reaching a compromise."
