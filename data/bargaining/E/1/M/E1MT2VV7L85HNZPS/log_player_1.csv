"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected the fair split, now I'm taking a bit more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting and potentially getting even less in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
