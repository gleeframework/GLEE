"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is trying to make a better offer.
