"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to share the funds, with a slight emphasis on my share due to the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept, I believe we can do better. The inflation rate is significantly higher for Alice, and the 70/30 split is too much in her favor. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
