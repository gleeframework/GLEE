"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the original $6,000, so it's now worth $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $2,500, which is 25% of the original $10,000. That's a relatively low offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject the offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low. I'll try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 40% less than the original $6,000, so it's now worth $3,600.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle, no more, no less 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 48.8% less than the original $6,000, so it's now worth $3,120.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $5,000, which is a good offer, especially since it's a 50-50 split. I think I'll accept this offer.
