"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and gives Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'll take 50% and you can have 50%. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than the initial $8,000, so I would get $6,400 (80% of $8,000). Bob's gain is worth 10% less than the initial $2,000, so he would get $4,500 (50% of $9,000, considering the 10% reduction).

I don't think this offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than the $6,400 I would have gotten in the previous round, so I would get $5,120 (80% of $6,400).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 70% and you can have 30%.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 48.8% less than the initial $8,000, so I would get $4,160 (40% of $10,400, considering the 48.8% reduction). Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than the initial $2,000, so he would get $5,455 (60% of $9,091, considering the 27.1% reduction).

I think this offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. I'll accept it.
