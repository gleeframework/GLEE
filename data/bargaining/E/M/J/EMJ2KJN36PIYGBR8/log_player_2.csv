Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still more than I think you deserve 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While my patience is wearing thin, accepting 42 dollars that are worth significantly less than at the start still leaves me with a terrible deal. There's a chance Alice might panic as we get closer to the later rounds and offer something more acceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but it has to be reasonable. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply pressure and set a firm boundary.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better in the subsequent rounds, and the value of my potential gains is steadily decreasing.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to push Alice to accept a less favorable deal than she ideally wants, but one that still gives her a slight advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly calling my bluff and knows I'm desperate. If I reject this, there's a very real chance she'll push even further in the next round, leaving me with an even worse deal. Accepting a 41/59 split, while far from ideal, is better than risking a worse outcome as the effects of inflation continue to bite."
