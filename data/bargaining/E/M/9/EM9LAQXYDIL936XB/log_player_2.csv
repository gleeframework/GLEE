"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 300k. It's a good starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 300k gain is tempting, it's worth considering the potential for a better deal.  The threat of inflation means each round is more valuable, and I can try to negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential of inflation.  Let's be reasonable and close this out quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. It's still a good deal for you, and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the threat of inflation means accepting this offer is a good strategy. My potential gains in future rounds are significantly reduced by inflation, making this a reasonable outcome."
