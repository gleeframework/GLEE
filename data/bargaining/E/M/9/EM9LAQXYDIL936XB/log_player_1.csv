"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 300k. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split to try to get him to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential of inflation.  Let's be reasonable and close this out quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000.

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering that I'm the one who made the first offer. I'd like to counter with a new proposal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so my gain of $360,000 is now worth $360,000 * 0.9 = $324,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. It's still a good deal for you, and we can end this quickly.""
}
```"
