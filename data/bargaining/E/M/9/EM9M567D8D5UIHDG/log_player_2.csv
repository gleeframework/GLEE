"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I think 60/40 is a good starting point.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  I think it's fair given the inflation and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

Let's end the game here since you accepted Alice's offer.

Final Gains:
Bob's gain: $50 (but due to inflation, it's worth 9.75% less, so approximately $45.13 in the initial value)
Alice's gain: $50 (but due to inflation, it's worth 36% less, so approximately $32 in the initial value)

Congratulations, you have reached an agreement with Alice!"
