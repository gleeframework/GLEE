"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's not a bad starting point, but I know that the money will be worth less in later rounds, so I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split would be fairer.  Let's both get closer to half.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome."
