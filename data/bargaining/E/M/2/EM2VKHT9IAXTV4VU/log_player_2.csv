"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, it is a fair proposal, and there is no incentive to reject it in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees a gain of $500,000, which is half of the total amount, a reasonable and optimal outcome given the rules of the game."
