"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This should be a fair starting point, as I'm taking into account the inflation risk and want to incentivize Bob to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get something, and it's better than potentially getting nothing in future rounds due to further inflation."
