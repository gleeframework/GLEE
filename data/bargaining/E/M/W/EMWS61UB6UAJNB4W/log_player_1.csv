Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a more aggressive split. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000

```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
