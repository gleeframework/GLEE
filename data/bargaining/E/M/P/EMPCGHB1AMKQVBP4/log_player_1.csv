"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the game's rules and the fact that Bob's share will depreciate faster. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a polite way to initiate the negotiation, suggesting that the proposed split is a fair one. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This is a better deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, accepting 45% of the original amount in the second round doesn't seem like the best deal, especially considering the starting point of 60% in the first round. It's my turn again, and I'll try to negotiate a better split.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how it goes!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway between our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor. Given the effects of inflation, this is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. The message suggests finding a middle ground, taking into account the depreciation of the money's value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
