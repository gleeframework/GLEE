"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Let's see if we can find a more equitable split. I propose 55/45.  This way, we both get a good portion, and we can end this negotiation early.  
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share. However, considering the inflation,  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option for both of us at this point. This will allow us to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation.""}
