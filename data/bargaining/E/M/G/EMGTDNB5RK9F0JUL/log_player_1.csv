"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75$, you get 25$. It's fair and simple.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, but I think it's a bit more reasonable than your previous offer. You can't expect to get 75% of the money, can you? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
