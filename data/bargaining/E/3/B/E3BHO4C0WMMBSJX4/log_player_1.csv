"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he deserves more for taking the risk of negotiating with me!

I'll consider his offer, taking into account the inflation effect. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more for taking the risk? I think I deserve more for being willing to negotiate with you!""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting higher! Due to inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 58/42 is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more favorable split, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I'm still underpaid for my negotiation skills! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob still thinks he deserves more!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less. I'll try to negotiate a better deal, but I'll also consider the fact that the money is decreasing in value rapidly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'm not willing to give you 60% of the remaining value. I'll make a new offer that's more in line with the decreasing value of the money""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Due to inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less. I'll aim to make a more aggressive offer, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal. I'll give you 64% of the remaining value, but that's as high as I'm willing to go""
}
```

I'm pushing for a more favorable split, considering the inflation effect and the decreasing value of the money."
