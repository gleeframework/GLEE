"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible offer for Bob!  Even though it's only the first round, there's no reason to accept such a small share. Let's see if Alice will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice will accept a more even split. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still incredibly unfair. While the money is worth less for me now due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll see if I can convince her in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Alice to 400,000, while still ensuring a significant share for myself.  Hopefully, this shows her that I'm willing to negotiate, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement before the inflation further reduces my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too low.  Even though the money is worth significantly less for me now, I'm not going to accept such a small portion.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, a fair and equitable solution.  With each passing round, the inflation is eating away at my share.  A 50/50 split is the most reasonable and pragmatic solution at this point."
