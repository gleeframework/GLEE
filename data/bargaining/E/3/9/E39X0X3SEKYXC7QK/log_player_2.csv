Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to be greedy. It's only the first round and the money is still worth a lot. I'll see what Alice offers next."

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still aiming for a higher share. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep playing."

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
