"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, Bob's offer is actually more generous than my initial offer, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
