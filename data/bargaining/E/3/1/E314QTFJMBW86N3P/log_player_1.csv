"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my initial offer would have been equivalent to $810,000, and now Bob's offer is equivalent to $450,000 each. I'll accept Bob's offer.
