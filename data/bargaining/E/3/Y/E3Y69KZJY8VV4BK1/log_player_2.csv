"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think a 70/30 split in my favor is fair considering the inflation rate.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split. It's a fair deal for both of us in this round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Your offer was heavily affected by the inflation. I'm proposing 65/35 - it's a better deal than you'll get in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, it seems like you're not taking the inflation seriously.  I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. I'm offering 55/45.  Let's close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. 60/40 is the best you'll get considering the inflation will only get worse for you.  Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, getting $40 is better than risking another round where the value diminishes even further.
