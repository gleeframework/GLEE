"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to leave room for negotiation and a potential increase in his share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money more evenly. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my calculation. Since my gain is worth 10% less, I'll effectively be getting 7,200 (8,000 x 0.9) if I accept this offer. Meanwhile, Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'll effectively be getting 4,800 (6,000 x 0.8).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially get a better offer in the next round. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain is now worth 70% of its original value (7,200 x 0.9 = 6,480). I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a mutually acceptable solution."
