"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I hope Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My offer from round 1 is now worth 60% of its original value, and Bob's offer from round 2 is worth 80% of its original value.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value now (due to two rounds of inflation), I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This is a 42-58 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll! My offer from round 3 is now worth 25.2% of its original value, and Bob's offer from round 4 is worth 85% of its original value.

I'll think carefully... 150,000 is a relatively small amount, but it's still more than I got in the previous round. I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
