Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. That first offer was ridiculous. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Take it or leave it, but the pot shrinks for both of us the longer we play. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
