"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm thinking 55-45, giving you a bit more since you were generous in the first round. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm glad Bob is willing to give me a bit more! However, I'm not sure if 45-55 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 45-55, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 50-50 and see if we can make it work""}

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me at 50-50."
