"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this is a fair split to begin our negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was a bit too low for me. Let's be more ambitious. This offer gives us both a decent share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains as we progress.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the ambition, but let's be realistic. This offer acknowledges the decreasing value of the money as time passes and provides a good balance for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob. While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still tilted in her favor.  Bob can afford to be a bit more patient and see if he can secure a better deal as the rounds progress and Alice becomes more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  My offer still provides you a good portion while recognizing the time pressure we're both under."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm but showing a willingness to compromise slightly. He's reduced his demand while still aiming for a larger share than Alice's offers. The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation, putting a bit more pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer is a serious attempt to meet in the middle while considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, her offers are creeping up but still favor her. Bob is in a strong position to push for a bit more, knowing that the inflation heavily impacts Alice.  He can likely secure a better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with something substantial before inflation erodes the value further."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a strategic move to appear more compromising while still holding a strong position.  

* **Even Split:**  The 50/50 split is objectively fair and difficult for Alice to argue against. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By emphasizing the time pressure and inflation, Bob reminds Alice that her potential gains are diminishing rapidly.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** After rejecting several offers, proposing an even split makes Bob seem more agreeable to a compromise, potentially swaying Alice to accept."
