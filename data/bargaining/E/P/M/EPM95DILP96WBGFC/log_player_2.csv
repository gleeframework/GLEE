Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give up more than before, but I need a better deal than your last offer.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing the offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The impact of inflation is also becoming more significant. It's worth holding out for a better deal a little longer."
