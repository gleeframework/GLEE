"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is a relatively small amount, to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more fairly. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation rate, my gain of $40 is actually worth $36, and Bob's gain of $60 is worth $48. It's a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but it's still a relatively small difference.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give up the majority of the money so early in the game. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more given the risks of inflation!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking a larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $55 is worth $40.25 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $100, which is 100 - 27.1 = 72.9, and then 55 * 0.729 = 40.245, rounding to 40.25)
Bob's gain of $45 is worth $23.10 (since it's 48.8% less than the original $100, which is 100 - 48.8 = 51.2, and then 45 * 0.512 = 23.04, rounding to 23.10)

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually quite favorable to Bob. I'm not sure if I want to accept it, especially since I'm still getting a smaller share than I initially wanted.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm willing to give you a small share if you meet my conditions!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking an even larger share of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $60 is worth $18.19 (since it's 40.95% less than the original $100, which is 100 - 40.95 = 59.05, and then 60 * 0.5905 = 35.53, rounding to 18.19)
Bob's gain of $40 is worth $13.20 (since it's 67.23% less than the original $100, which is 100 - 67.23 = 32.77, and then 40 * 0.3277 = 13.13, rounding to 13.20)

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually quite close to the original offer I made in round 1. However, I'm not sure if I want to accept it, especially since I've been pushing for a larger share throughout the game.

However, I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob is trying to meet me in the middle. I'll accept this offer and end the game.
