"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more fair since I'm taking the risk of being the proposer this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of me since he's the proposer this round. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. You can't have all the gain just because you're the proposer!""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to try to get a better deal, but I'm still willing to compromise."
