"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll propose a division that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my proposal in the previous round was a bit too generous. Now, Alice is offering me 45, which is a bit less than what I initially proposed. I'll stick with my original plan and try to get a better deal. I'll reject Alice's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 36% reduction in value for me and the 0% reduction for Alice, I'll aim for a division that takes this into account. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
