"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm starting with a slightly larger share to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as keen on accepting a lower share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to find a compromise and avoid further rounds."
