"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split, keeping most of the money for myself while still offering Bob a small share. I hope he accepts, but if not, I'll need to be more strategic in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With inflation, the money is worth less each round.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I can't be sure Bob will offer anything better in the next round."
