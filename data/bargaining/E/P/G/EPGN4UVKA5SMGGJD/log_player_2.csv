"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the amount equally after adjusting for the first round's inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems fair on the surface, Bob knows the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money. It's better to see what Alice's next offer will be after inflation takes a bite out of her potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""This proposal reflects the first round of inflation and aims to be fair while still offering a decent gain for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the amount based on our previous gains, adjusting for inflation, aiming for a balanced outcome. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob might want a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The continued inflation will likely erode his gains if he rejects and the game goes on. This offer is still a decent gain, and accepting it ensures Bob gets something rather than risking getting nothing at all."
