"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game off on a fair note. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small lead, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is actually worth 40 * 0.95 = 38, and Bob's gain of 60 is actually worth 60 * 0.8 = 48.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a 10% lead, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
