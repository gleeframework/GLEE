"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to make a better offer next time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still want to keep some buffer for myself""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before. I'm trying to make a more competitive offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic,  I'm taking a larger share.  Time is money, and we're running out of it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With my gain being worth only 51.2% of its original value, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, but I need to think about the opportunity cost of rejecting it.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can still salvage some value from the deal.
