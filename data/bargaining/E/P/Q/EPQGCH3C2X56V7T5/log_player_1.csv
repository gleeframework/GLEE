"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to see a more favorable split, considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, considering the decreased value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I can do better. Your offer was a bit too generous to Alice. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer because I think I can still do better. I'd like to see a more favorable split, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle, Bob. It's the fairest split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game."
