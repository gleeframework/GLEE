Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still aiming for a better deal. The inflation effect on Alice makes her offer more appealing, but I'm not convinced yet."

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with 55/45, and we can both walk away happy.""}
