  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early!""

  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. I'll have to be more cautious with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""A very modest proposal, Bob. I'm willing to give you most of it, but I need something reasonable.""
}

Round 6

# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. I'll have to be extremely cautious now.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6, as it's an extremely unfavorable split. I'd rather risk going to the next round than give him 95% of the remaining money.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. I'll have to be extremely careful with my next offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, Bob. This is my last reasonable offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll take it all now. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really decimating the value of the money. I'm not sure I can do better than this offer, but I'll try to hold out.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 8. I'd rather have $1 than give him 99% of the remaining money.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is almost worthless at this point. I'll make a final, desperate offer.

Considering the 52.17% inflation since Round 1, I'll aim for a split that's almost negligible. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""I'm out of options, Bob. Take it all if you want it.""
}
```

I'm essentially giving up, but I'll try to salvage what's left."
