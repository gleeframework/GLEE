"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you have to be willing to take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather not give up 700,000, which is a significant portion of the remaining money. I'm hoping I can do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

```

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob! I'll meet you halfway, but no more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 680,000, which is a 68-32 split, and framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slightly better deal for me than my previous offer, I still think I can do better. I'd rather wait for a better offer, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gain."
