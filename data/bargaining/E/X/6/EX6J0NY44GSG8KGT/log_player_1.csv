"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer, aiming to maximize my share.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets a baseline for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my previous one, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to take a bit less, but I want a larger share than this. I'll see if I can improve the deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than his previous offer, but it's still a substantial amount.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as we both get a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, and with the increasing effects of inflation, I'm happy to accept. It's a better deal than what I was previously offering, and it's a good outcome for both of us."
