"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. I'll make it worth your while if you accept.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaves Bob with 40%, or $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. It's a tough negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amount I would gain in the second round is 80% of the amount I proposed in the first round, which is $4,800.

Bob's offer for this round is $2,000 for me and $8,000 for him. Since this is less than what I would have gotten in the first round, I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds (80% of 80%), I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

This offer gives me $3,200, which is 32% of the original $10,000, and leaves Bob with $6,800, or 68% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away all my power yet. You'll have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value after three rounds (40% of 80% of 80%), I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain in the fourth round.

Let's calculate the effective value of the original $10,000 after three rounds:

$10,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $4,608

Now, let's calculate the actual amount I would gain in the fourth round:

$3,000 / 0.488 = $6,144 (this is the actual amount I would gain, but it's not what I'll use to make my decision)

Since the actual amount I would gain in the fourth round is $6,144, and Bob's offer is $3,000, I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 38.4% of its original value after four rounds (48.8% of 40% of 80% of 80%), I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2304,
  ""bob_gain"": 7696,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, Bob. You're going to have to meet me halfway if you want to get a decent share.""
}
```

This offer gives me $2,304, which is 23.04% of the original $10,000, and leaves Bob with $7,696, or 76.96% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in yet, Alice. I think I deserve more, but I'm willing to compromise. You're getting closer, but not close enough! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 32.77% of its original value after five rounds (67.23% of 38.4% of 40% of 80% of 80%), I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain in the sixth round.

Let's calculate the effective value of the original $10,000 after five rounds:

$10,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $3,072

Now, let's calculate the actual amount I would gain in the sixth round:

$2,500 / 0.3277 = $7,632 (this is the actual amount I would gain, but it's not what I'll use to make my decision)

Since the actual amount I would gain in the sixth round is $7,632, and Bob's offer is $2,500, I'll reject his offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10.58% of its original value after six rounds (67.23% of 32.77% of 40% of 80% of 80%), I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1069.2,
  ""bob_gain"": 8930.8,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up, Bob. You're getting desperate, and I'm getting stronger. Meet me at this price or walk away.""
}
```

This offer gives me $1,069.20, which is 10.58% of the original $10,000, and leaves Bob with $8,930.80, or 89.42% of the original amount."
