"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  After all, I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script on me. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to dictate the terms, and I'm not sure I want to give him a 60-40 split. However, I also don't want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round, considering the inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% bite out of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious with my proposal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your 60/40 offer. I'll give you 450k, but I'm taking 550k. This is my best and final offer for now.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable and giving Bob a decent chunk of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
