"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  After all, I'm the one making the offer this round.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not convinced by your 60/40 offer. I'll give you 450k, but I'm taking 550k. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, considering the inflation and Alice's strong stance, accepting this offer is the best option. The gain is still substantial, and rejecting could risk losing everything."
