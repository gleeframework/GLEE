"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but it also leaves Bob with something, which might make him more likely to accept it in the first round.  It's a gamble, but I think it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot less favorable than my initial proposal, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 7000, but still maintaining a significant advantage. The inflation factor is starting to hurt, so I need to strike a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is now the best I can realistically expect.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, rather than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
