"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'll offer Bob $1 and keep $999,999 for myself. It's a classic ""take it or leave it"" strategy. If he rejects, he might get a slightly better offer in the next round, but it's unlikely to be much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999998, ""bob_gain"": 2} 
```

I'm going to increase Bob's share by $1, hoping he'll be more willing to accept.  It's still heavily in my favor, but shows I'm willing to compromise slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 999998 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a classic negotiation pattern. We're both raising our stakes, but neither of us is willing to give up too much. I'll keep rejecting until we reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999997, ""bob_gain"": 3} 
```

I'm increasing Bob's share by $1 again.  This pattern is clearly working for him, but I'm hoping he'll realize we are running out of rounds and a split more in his favor would be better than getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 999997 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

We're in a stalemate.  The pattern is clear - he'll keep raising his share by $1 each round. I'll keep rejecting until we reach a point where he's forced to make a more substantial compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999996, ""bob_gain"": 4} 
```

I'm sticking to the pattern, hoping he'll realize we're both wasting time with this back-and-forth.  However, we're getting close to the end, and I'm going to have to start considering if I want to take a bigger hit to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 999996 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

We're running out of rounds and this pattern is only going to continue.  I'm not willing to accept anything less than a 50/50 split, so I need to be prepared to take a bigger hit in the next round to try and secure a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

We're getting dangerously close to the end. It's time for a radical shift. I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob sees the value of finally reaching an agreement. If he rejects this, we're both walking away with nothing, and the risk is simply too high for both of us."
