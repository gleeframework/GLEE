This is a fair starting point, in my opinion. We'll see how Bob feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to make a slightly more favorable offer to myself. The money is worth less for Bob in each round, so I'm hoping he might be persuaded."
