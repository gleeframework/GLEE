"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to show good faith. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Since the money is worth 10% less with each round, accepting this offer means Bob is effectively losing money over time. It's better to see if Alice will budge on the split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60/40.  This will be a good starting point to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
