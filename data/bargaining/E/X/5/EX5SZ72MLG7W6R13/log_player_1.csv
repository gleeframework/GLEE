Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, fair and square. We both get a good chunk and can avoid any further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
