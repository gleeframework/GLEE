Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try 45/55. This is still a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
