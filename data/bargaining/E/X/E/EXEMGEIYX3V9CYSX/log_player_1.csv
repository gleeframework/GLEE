"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small share for now.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm trying to be friendly and give him a small share to start, while keeping a larger portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money I gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40 * 0.8 = $32, and Bob will get $60.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
