 Congratulations, the game is over!
Here's the final division of the $1,000,000:
Alice's gain: $450,000
Bob's gain: $550,000

Because of the inflation on your side, your gain is worth 27.1% less than it would have been in the first round, so your actual gain is:
$450,000 * 0.729 = $328,050

Bob's gain is worth the same as in the first round, so his actual gain is still $550,000.

Let's play again if you want!"
