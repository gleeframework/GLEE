"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going""
}
```

This offer gives me $80 and Bob $20, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not going to give you the whole thing 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the values are now:

Alice's gain: $40 * 0.8 = $32
Bob's gain: $60 * 0.9 = $54

I'll reject this offer because I can do better than a 32:54 split. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation""
}
```

This offer gives me $55 and Bob $45, which seems like a reasonable split considering the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you a huge chunk, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Alice's gain: $25 * 0.512 (48.8% less than the original $80) = $12.80
Bob's gain: $75 * 0.727 (27.1% less than the original $100) = $54.51

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of money. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to ensure I get something substantial""
}
```

This offer gives me $30 and Bob $70, which seems like a reasonable compromise considering the rapidly decreasing value of money."
