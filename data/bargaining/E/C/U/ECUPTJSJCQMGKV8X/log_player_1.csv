Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to take a very small share to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
