"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept an offer where I get nothing! Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to propose a fair split that gives me a majority but still leaves something for Alice.  Hopefully, she'll see the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not getting a good deal.  It looks like Alice is playing a game of chicken, but I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}
```

I'll try to increase my offer to 80 for myself and 20 for Alice, hoping she'll see the value in getting something rather than waiting and risking getting nothing at all."
