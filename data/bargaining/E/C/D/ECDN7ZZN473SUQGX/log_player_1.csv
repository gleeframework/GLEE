"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}

I'm starting with a bold move, offering myself the entire $100!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't want to give up 90% of the money just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is eating away at the money, and Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll think about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 20$. It's not the best offer I could get, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer."
