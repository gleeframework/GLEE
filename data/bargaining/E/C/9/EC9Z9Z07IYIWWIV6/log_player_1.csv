"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
