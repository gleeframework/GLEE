Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fair, considering the inflation. We both get a good amount, and it's a more equal distribution than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
