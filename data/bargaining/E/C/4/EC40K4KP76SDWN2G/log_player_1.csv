"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a little more this time, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3,200.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation from the first two rounds, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64). I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
