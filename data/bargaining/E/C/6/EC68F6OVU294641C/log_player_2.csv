"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, 90% for me and 10% for you. Let's end this quickly and fairly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is far from fair.  I'll see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and we both get a good amount. Let's end this quickly and get our money!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, given the inflation. It's a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting and entering another round."
