This is a tough one! While frustrating, I need to be realistic. 

* **The Trend:** Bob is clearly content to wait me out, knowing the value of my potential earnings is decreasing.
* **Future Rounds:** If this continues, I risk getting even lower offers and losing significantly more value.
* **Bird in Hand:** Accepting 40 now, while far from ideal, is better than risking an even worse outcome."
