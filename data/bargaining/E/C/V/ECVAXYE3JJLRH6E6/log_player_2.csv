Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your turn Bob.  I'm compromising, but let's not forget time is money - literally.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get closer to a 60/40 split.  I'm not going to accept getting less than that."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor. I think this is a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement before we lose even more to inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of this money to inflation. My last offer is 52.5/47.5. Take it or leave it - it's your call. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a 60/40 split, the risk of losing even more money to inflation is too high.  I'll take the 52.5/47.5 split and move on."
