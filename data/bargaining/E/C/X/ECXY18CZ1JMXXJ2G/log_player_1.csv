"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 300,000 (worth 90% of the original 400,000)
* Bob gain: 700,000 (worth the same as the original 700,000)

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept it.
