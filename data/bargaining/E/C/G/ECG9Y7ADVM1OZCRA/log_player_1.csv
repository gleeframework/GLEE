"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than he gave me, hoping he'll accept to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm taking the deal.  The money is worth a lot less now, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
