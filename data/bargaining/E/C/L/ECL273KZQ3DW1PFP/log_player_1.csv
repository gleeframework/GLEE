"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can negotiate further if you'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to start with a slightly more balanced split.  550k for me, and 450k for you.  This gives us both a good starting point, and we can adjust as we go. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to start with this split. Let's see how the game unfolds!"
