"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large portion of the money (9000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller portion (1000$). I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as I'm not sure how inflation will affect our subsequent offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I would have accepted this offer in the first round, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money I would gain.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

Since inflation is a factor, I'm aiming for a higher share again.  I'm offering 7200 for myself, which is 20% less than my first offer, but still more than what Bob offered me. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as the next round will have another 20% inflation, further diminishing my share."
