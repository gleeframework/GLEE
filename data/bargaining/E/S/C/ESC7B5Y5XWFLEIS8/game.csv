40.0,60.0,"I appreciate the offer Alice, but how about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Time is money after all, and we're losing value with each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your time is valuable, but let's be realistic.  A 60/40 split is too much in your favor.  How about a 55/45 split? We both get more than we would in the next round due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Okay, Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. 58/42.  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's call it a draw.  Inflation is hurting both of us, and a 50/50 split is still the fairest option.  No more haggling,  let's end this and take what we can.",Alice,5,
