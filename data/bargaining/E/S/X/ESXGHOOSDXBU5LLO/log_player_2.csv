Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than your last.  The clock is ticking, let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
This is a tough decision! Alice is right, her offer is slightly better than what I offered her. However, I'm willing to gamble that she'll crack under the pressure of potentially getting even less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
