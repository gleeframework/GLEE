"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems fair to me as the starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 10-90 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation is still affecting the money's value, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is more favorable to me given the current inflation rate. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
