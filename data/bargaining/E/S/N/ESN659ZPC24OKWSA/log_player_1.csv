I'm going to propose a very uneven split.  I figure Bob might be hesitant to reject a $10,000 offer, even though it's a small piece of the pie.  This way, I get most of the money and we finish quickly.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get more, this is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round.  It's better to take half now than risk getting even less later."
