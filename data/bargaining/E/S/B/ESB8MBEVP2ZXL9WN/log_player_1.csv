This is a tough situation. While accepting a 30/70 split is far from ideal, it's the best I can hope for at this point.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The inflation is significantly cutting into my potential gains. Waiting any longer will only make the situation worse for me.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems determined to take advantage of the inflation working in his favor. It's unlikely he'll agree to a deal that benefits me significantly.

Accepting this offer cuts my losses and prevents me from getting even less in a future round."
