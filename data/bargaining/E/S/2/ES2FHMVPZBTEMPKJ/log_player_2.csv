Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair.  We both have a chance to lose more money with each round. A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
