"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to keep things moving. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation isn't too bad, and I'm hoping Alice will be more generous next time. Besides, I think I can get more than 40% of the total amount. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor, considering the inflation. I want to take advantage of Alice's 20% inflation rate to pressure her into accepting a lower amount.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. You're losing more value each round, so let's settle on this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  We're both losing value with each round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a good time to accept the offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and considering the inflation, I'm actually getting a slightly better deal than Alice. If I were to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, Alice might reject it again, and the inflation would continue to eat into the value of the money. I'm happy to settle on this and walk away with $5000."
