Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, I'm still willing to gamble. Alice seems to be pushing for a slightly advantageous split, but with the inflation working against her, I think I can get a better deal in the later rounds, even if it means accepting a lower nominal amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split wasn't so final after all, was it? 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't great, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject Alice's offers.  If I reject this, I risk walking away with nothing."
