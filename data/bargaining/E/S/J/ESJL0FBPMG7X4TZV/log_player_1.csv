"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think an even split is the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nSince Bob has offered an even split, which I believe is a fair solution, I will accept this offer. There's no reason to risk further rounds and the possibility of getting nothing when an equal division is proposed."
