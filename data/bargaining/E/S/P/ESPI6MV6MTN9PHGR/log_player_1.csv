"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I will take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start"". I am trying to be generous and give Bob a significant share, while also taking into account that I am the one who made the first offer. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects, I will proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I assume that the inflation rate of 5% per round only applies to me, and not to Bob. Is that correct?)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about we meet in the middle a bit more? This is a better deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI see that Bob has rejected my initial offer and has made a counteroffer. He is offering me $550,000, which is 55% of the total amount, and he will take $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount. His message suggests that he is trying to meet me in the middle and that this is a better deal for me considering the inflation.\n\n###\n\nHowever, I am not convinced that this is a good enough offer. Considering that the money is worth 5% less to me in this round, I would like to get a better deal. I am willing to take a risk and proceed to the next round to see if I can get a better offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I have rejected his offer, and I will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI will make a new proposal to Bob. Since the money is worth 5% less to me in this round, I will try to get a better deal. I will offer Bob $420,000, which is 42% of the total amount, and I will take $580,000, which is 58% of the total amount. My message to Bob is ""Considering the inflation, I need a better deal. This is my new offer"".\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a better deal. This is my new offer""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects, I will proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the inflation rate of 5% per round only applies to me, and not to Bob, correct? This means that the amount Bob receives is always worth the same, but the amount I receive is worth 5% less in each subsequent round. Is that correct?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is working against you Alice.  Let's settle this now with a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob has rejected my offer from round 3 and has made a new counteroffer. He is offering me $530,000, which is 53% of the total amount, and he will take $470,000, which is 47% of the total amount. His message suggests that the inflation is working against me and that I should settle for this offer.\n\n###\n\nHowever, I am not convinced that this is a good enough offer. Considering that the money is worth 14.26% less to me in this round, I would like to get a better deal. I am willing to take a risk and proceed to the next round to see if I can get a better offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I have rejected his offer, and I will make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nI will keep in mind that the inflation rate is cumulative, so the amount I receive is worth less and less in each subsequent round. I will try to factor this into my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I will make a new proposal to Bob. Since the money is worth 14.26% less to me in this round, and considering that the inflation rate is cumulative, I will try to get a better deal. I will offer Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount, and I will take $550,000, which is 55% of the total amount.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  The inflation is only going to hurt you more. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob has rejected my offer from round 5 and has made a new counteroffer. He is offering a 50/50 split, with both of us getting $500,000. His message suggests that the inflation is only going to hurt me more and that I should accept this offer to end the game now.\n\n###\n\nConsidering that the money is worth 22.62% less to me in this round, a 50/50 split might not be as bad as it seems. However, I am still not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. On the other hand, the inflation rate is cumulative, and the longer we play, the less the money is worth to me.\n\n###\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided to accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I have accepted his offer, and we can end the game here. I hope I made the right decision!"
