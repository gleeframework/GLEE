"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation rates.  Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Considering the inflation rates, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
