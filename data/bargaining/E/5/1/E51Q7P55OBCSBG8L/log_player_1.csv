"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob taking 100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though my share is much smaller, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation means my share will continue to decrease if I keep rejecting offers. It's better to take a smaller amount now than risk getting nothing at all later."
