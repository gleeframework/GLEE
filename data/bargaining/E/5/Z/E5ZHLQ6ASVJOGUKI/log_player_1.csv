"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this round. We both lose value with each passing round, so a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
