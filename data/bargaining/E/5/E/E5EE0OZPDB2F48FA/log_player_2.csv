Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. Let's split it closer to the middle this time. This is still a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the fact that the inflation rate is hurting her more than it's hurting me. While she's offering a more even split, she's still getting the larger share. I need to push for a better deal, knowing that every round that passes puts more pressure on her to accept."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's be realistic and split it more evenly. This offer is still favorable to me, but it acknowledges your position. Let's end this before the inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is now offering a deal very close to my last one. While I could hold out for a slightly better deal, there's a real risk that she'll become desperate and offer an even worse split in the next round. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even though it's slightly less than I aimed for initially."
