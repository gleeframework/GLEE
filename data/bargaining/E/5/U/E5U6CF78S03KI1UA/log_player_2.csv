"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the initial offer seems heavily skewed in Alice's favor, the rapid depreciation of the money for Alice means there's a chance to secure a much better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases quickly for you. I propose 60/40 in my favor. This ensures you get a reasonable amount while accounting for the depreciation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the depreciation, I'm willing to compromise. 58-42 is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the depreciation, but she's still aiming for a larger share. Holding out a bit longer could lead to an even better deal for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and your share is rapidly losing value. 65/35 is generous considering the circumstances.  Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise. 56-44 is a better deal for both of us, considering the time left. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but she's still overvaluing her rapidly depreciating share.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become. Bob is in a strong position to push for a much better split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
