"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. You get a small piece to start, and we can go from there. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it seems quite unfair. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we are in Round 1, the money hasn't lost any value yet, right? And if we proceed to Round 2, that's when the 5% decrease in value for me starts, correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
