"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I still hold some negotiating power. Accepting $4,400 now is a significant loss compared to the potential future gains if Alice starts to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Let's be practical.  We're past the halfway point. This offer benefits us both.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The relentless march of inflation has eroded my potential gains significantly. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting a $4,600 share is better than risking a complete loss with only 5 rounds remaining."
