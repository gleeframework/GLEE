"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was hoping to get more than 40 dollars in the first round, and now I'm being offered 30 dollars. I'd like to make a new proposal that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer was 60/40.""}

I'm proposing a 75/25 split, with me getting 75 dollars and Bob getting 25 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's getting closer to what I was initially hoping for. The 80/20 split is a significant improvement from the 75/25 split I proposed, and I'm willing to take it. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later, and I don't want to risk going to zero if we don't divide the money soon."
