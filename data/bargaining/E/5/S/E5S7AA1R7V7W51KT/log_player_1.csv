"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement and avoid any potential losses from inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards his side.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decrease in purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the 20% decrease in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to a 50/50 split, which is a good starting point.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's a fair deal given the circumstances.
