Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While 400,000 is a lot of money, it's worth negotiating for more.  Since the money is worth less in each round, it's in Bob's best interest to try and get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
