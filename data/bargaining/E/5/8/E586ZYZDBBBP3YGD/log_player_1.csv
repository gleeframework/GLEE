"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large share, but also ensures Bob gets something. It might be tempting to offer him even less, but considering the inflation factor, a smaller offer might lead to me receiving less in the end if he rejects it and gets to propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While this is significantly less than my initial proposal, accepting it is the best strategy.  If I reject, I'll have to make a counter-offer, but with each round, the value of my share decreases due to inflation. Bob's offer is guaranteed, while mine is constantly diminishing. It's better to take the smaller share now than risk getting nothing."
