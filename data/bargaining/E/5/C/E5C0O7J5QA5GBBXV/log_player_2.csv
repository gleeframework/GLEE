{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Alice. You get 10% and I get 90%.  It's more than you offered me last time, and with the inflation, we'll both be better off.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Bob.  It's the fairest way to go, considering the inflation. We both get a decent amount, and we don't have to keep playing this game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
