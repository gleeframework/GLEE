Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Here's why I advise rejection:

* **Inflation is hurting you:**  The longer we wait, the less your share is actually worth. 
* **Alice is being stubborn:**  She's barely budged from her initial offer.  There's a chance she'll get more desperate as the rounds progress.

We need to apply more pressure and make her realize time is running out for both of us."

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. It's a 50/50 split or we both lose out!""}
