I'm going to be a bit greedy and offer Bob a small amount.  I figure he might accept it since he doesn't know about the inflation.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more greedy! I'm going to reject this offer. I'm hoping he'll overplay his hand and I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit. I'll offer Bob a slightly higher amount, but I'll still take the lion's share. I figure he's becoming more greedy, so maybe he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer, even though I'm not happy about it.  I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
