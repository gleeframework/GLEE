I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation will make any future rounds significantly less profitable for me, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything better."
