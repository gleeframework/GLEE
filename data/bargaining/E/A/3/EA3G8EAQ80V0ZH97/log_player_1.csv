Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, since we both have an equal chance of getting the better end of the deal in the later rounds due to the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split yet, especially considering the inflation will impact me more heavily. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share due to the inflation. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to avoid further rounds of negotiation.  Let's settle on a 40/60 split to keep things moving forward. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would still prefer a larger share, I acknowledge the increasing inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'd rather secure this amount than continue negotiating and risk losing everything."
