Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to my limit, think carefully 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, time is also running out.  It's worth risking another rejection to see if we can get Alice to budge a bit further in our favor. Accepting now guarantees a loss, but holding out still offers a chance for a better outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes any further."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on with dwindling time and diminishing returns. Offering a 50/50 split is now the most strategic move:

* **Fairness:**  It eliminates arguments of greed, making it harder for Alice to justify a rejection based on fairness.
* **Urgency:** The ""take it or leave it"" emphasizes the time constraint, pushing Alice towards a decision. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While we want a better share, getting nothing is worse. A 50/50 split guarantees some reward if accepted."
