"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $6,000 and keeping $4,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll consider that in my decision.

I'll accept this offer. 

```
