Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was quite greedy. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This considers the time pressure and the fact that I'm losing more to inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 65/35 in my favor.  This acknowledges your losses from inflation, while still giving me a majority share. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal, even with the acknowledgment of inflation.  While the time pressure is on, accepting a deal this heavily skewed in her favor sets a bad precedent for future rounds. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the threat of getting $0 looms larger."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's time to be serious. We're halfway through the rounds and this is getting us nowhere. I propose a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds left, the threat of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real. A firm offer now might push Alice to settle. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. This emphasizes that I'm willing to be reasonable, but I'm not going to be pushed around.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** ""Take it or leave it"" sounds strong, but it doesn't lock me into a position.  If she rejects it, I can still adapt my strategy in the next round."
