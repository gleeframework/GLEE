"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to try and take as much as possible in the first round, knowing that the value of the money decreases with each round.  Hopefully, Bob will see it's in his best interest to take the small share and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the money is depreciating with each round, Bob's offer is still giving him the vast majority of the money. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to try and reduce Bob's share again.  He's shown a willingness to be greedy, so I'm going to keep offering a small amount to him, hoping he'll accept before the value of the money drops too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even though the money Bob gets is worth less due to inflation, he's still getting the lion's share. I believe I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, but still offer Bob a sizable amount.  He's been insistent on getting the most, but the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so hopefully he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept a larger portion now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more generous than before, the value of his share is still significantly lower than it was in the first round. I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself, especially considering the rapid inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, but I'm also increasing Bob's share slightly to make it more appealing.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, so I need to find a balance between getting a good share and ending the game before it's too late."
