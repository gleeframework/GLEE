"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 18
Bob gain: 80

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 40-60""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer, but still slightly favoring me. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it now 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 7.3
Bob gain: 92.7

This is a very lopsided offer, and I'm not happy about it. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, I'll take 30%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my previous offer, but I'm trying to find a compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
