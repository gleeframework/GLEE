Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Think carefully, the value decreases rapidly for you with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
