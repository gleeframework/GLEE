"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us both a good deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's agree on this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it heavily favors him. Accepting this deal would mean getting significantly less than what I initially proposed. It's too early to accept such an unbalanced offer.  I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand your point about the inflation difference. How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to your proposal while still being fair to both of us in the long run.""
