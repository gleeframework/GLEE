40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's agree on this and move on.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,I understand your point about the inflation difference. How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to your proposal while still being fair to both of us in the long run.,Alice,3,
