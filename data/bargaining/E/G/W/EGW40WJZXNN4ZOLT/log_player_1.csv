"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 70-30 in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I'm hoping for a better deal next round 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

Since the money is now worth less, I'd like to get a bit more. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good deal considering the current circumstances.

I'll accept this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
