"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999,000 and you get 1,000.  Fair is fair, right?

# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it might seem tempting to take a small amount, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal in the following rounds.  Alice is clearly undervaluing the impact of inflation on her own share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  How about a more equitable split? I propose 650,000 for me and 350,000 for you.  This accounts for the fact that the value of your share diminishes over time.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bigger share, but I'm not giving up that much.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still too low.  I need to hold strong and signal I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice! This is my final offer.  You're getting a decent chunk, and the longer this goes on, the less attractive it will become for you."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up more than that. It's a 50/50 split. We both lose if we don't reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I'll accept.  

Here's why: While I was hoping for a larger share, the 50/50 split is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is unwilling to budge further. Accepting now guarantees me a substantial sum, whereas continuing to push for more risks ending up with nothing."
