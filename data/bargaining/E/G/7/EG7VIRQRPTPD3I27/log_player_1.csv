"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'd like to propose a division where I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. I'll accept.
