900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start with a fair-ish deal. I'm willing to give you 10% of the money, but we have a lot of rounds to go through, so hopefully, we can find a better outcome for both of us.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider the decreasing value and the limited rounds. This offer ensures a significant sum for both of us.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we need to find a more equitable split.  While I understand the decreasing value, a 60/40 split is too unbalanced.  I'm offering 55/45, which still gives you a good share, but allows for a more balanced outcome for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I appreciate your counter-offer, but we need to factor in the rapid devaluation. I'm proposing 58/42. This split recognizes the time pressure while still offering you a considerable amount.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the value of our money is decreasing rapidly. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest solution given the circumstances, and it ensures that we both receive a decent amount before the money loses its value completely. Let's agree to this and move on.",Alice,5,
