"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet in the middle, eh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and my $50 gain is now worth 4.75% less than it was in Round 1!

Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking its toll! My $55 gain is now worth significantly less than it was in Round 1.

I'll think about Bob's new offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than going to another round and dealing with even more inflation!"
