"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I think I can do better. This is a slightly more generous offer from me. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer from Bob is actually a better deal for me than it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
