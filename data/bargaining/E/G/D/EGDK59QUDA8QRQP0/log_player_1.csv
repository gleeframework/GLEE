"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take 999,000 dollars and give Bob 1,000 dollars. This is a very generous offer considering there's a lot of time left in the game and the money is losing value with each passing round.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a significant amount of money, I believe I can do better in future rounds.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a 60/40 split right away."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering the money is losing value with each round, and I believe it's a good starting point for a compromise.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. The money is depreciating rapidly, and I'm not willing to settle for a deal that favors Bob this much. I'll keep negotiating for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the current value of the money and the fact that we're getting closer to the end of the game. It's also closer to a 50/50 split than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this is a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While we are getting close to the end of the game, I am not willing to accept a 40/60 split in his favor.  The money is losing value quickly, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I will continue to strive for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable way to divide the remaining money, given the significant inflation we've experienced. Time is running out, and I believe this is the best chance for both of us to secure a reasonable share of the remaining funds."
