"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I'm not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

My current gain of $4000 is worth 80% of $5000, which is $4000. However, I was hoping to get more, considering Bob's gain is higher.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and I want to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small edge, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offer."
