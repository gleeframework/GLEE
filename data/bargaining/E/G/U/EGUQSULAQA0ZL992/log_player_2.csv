"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after each round, the total amount now is $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8).

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, the total amount now is $6,400 (10,000 * 0.8 * 0.64).

Alice's offer is 50/50, which is a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of the money.
