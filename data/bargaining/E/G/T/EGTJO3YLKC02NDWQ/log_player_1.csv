"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars. I'm keeping 60 dollars for myself, which is 60% of the initial 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer for Round 2...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain as:

$30 / (1 - 0.05) = $31.67

And since the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, Bob's gain is:

$30 / (1 - 0.10) = $33.33

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
