Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
Let's see if Bob will take a more balanced offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting a worse deal in the next round. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this point."
