"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move! I'm offering you nothing, but I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, hoping to set the tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to our negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
