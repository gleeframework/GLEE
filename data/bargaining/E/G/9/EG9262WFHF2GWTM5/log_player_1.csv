"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This offer gives you a decent share, but it's also fair to me given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**If I accept:**

* I get $4500, which is less than my initial offer, and the inflation means it's worth even less in real terms.
* Bob gets $5500, a significant gain for him.

**If I reject:**

* The money will be worth even less next round due to inflation.
* I'll have the chance to make a counter-offer, but Bob might be even tougher knowing I'm feeling the pressure of the declining value.

**Decision:** This is a risky move, but I'll try to push Bob a bit further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think this offer is fair given the inflation. Let's reach an agreement before the money loses even more value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tight! Bob is definitely using the inflation to his advantage. Let's break it down:

**If I accept:**

* I get $4800. With inflation, that's feeling a lot less appealing than the earlier rounds, especially compared to my original ask of $6000.
* Bob gets $5200, a win for him.

**If I reject:**

* The value decreases again. Time is working against me.
* I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go, and I risk getting an even worse deal later.

**Decision:**  This offer isn't great, but the risk of continuing is getting too high. I need to cut my losses.
