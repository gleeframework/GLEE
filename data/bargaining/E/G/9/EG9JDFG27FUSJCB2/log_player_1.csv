"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. It's a fair start, and I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money.  The risk of further rounds and potential losses due to inflation outweighs the potential for a larger gain later."
