"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair starting offer that leaves room for negotiation. It's slightly biased towards Alice to compensate for the faster depreciation of her money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 
This offer is a 50/50 split, acknowledging the inflation that has occurred. It's a compromise from the previous round and could be seen as a fair offer."
