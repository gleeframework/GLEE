"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm prioritizing a fast resolution to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, even considering the inflation. I'll reject it and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but still offering a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than his previous offer, and that he'll be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very greedy, and the inflation is hurting me significantly. While I'm losing more with each round, I won't accept such a lopsided deal. I'll try to negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to offer a decent amount to Bob. I'm hoping that he'll realize that we're both losing money with each passing round, and that it's in his best interest to reach a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm losing out on a lot of money. I won't accept this deal, I'll try to counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split. We're both losing money with each passing round, and the longer we wait, the less we'll both get. It's time to compromise."
