Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy strategy in the first round, aiming for the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get. With inflation, the money is losing value each round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me something, whereas rejecting it might leave me with nothing in later rounds."
