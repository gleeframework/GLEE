"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a bigger one this round 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less this round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 * 0.95 = 2850
* Bob gain: 7000 * 0.95 = 6650

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I want a better deal.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'll make it worth your while 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 * 0.8586 = 3433.44
* Bob gain: 6000 * 0.8586 = 5141.6

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, and the fact that Bob is still trying to get a larger share. However, I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced, I want a better deal.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting $4,600 and Bob getting $5,400. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but I'm still trying to be reasonable and find a compromise."
