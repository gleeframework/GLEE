Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing rapidly.  Take this chance to secure a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a reasonable amount before inflation eats it all away! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but it's still better to hold out. While the value is decreasing rapidly, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half isn't ideal.  There's a chance Alice will panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need a larger share to agree. This offer considers the decreasing value.""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, with time running out and inflation eating away at the potential gains. It's time to signal some flexibility but hold onto a reasonable position. Offering Alice slightly more than half might be enough to tempt her into a deal, especially since she seems to value getting a decent amount before inflation eats away at it all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  You're getting a terrible deal, but it's better than nothing, which is what we'll both have soon! 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, as it's likely a bluff, but Alice is clearly getting anxious. Calling her bluff might result in a better deal in the next round. While 2800 is significantly diminished, it's still better than zero. However, there's a good chance Alice will crack under pressure as we approach the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop this.  I know you want the bigger share, so I'll accept your previous offer of 4000 for me and 6000 for you.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's a gamble, but by mirroring her previous offer and presenting it as a concession, Alice might believe I'm now willing to accept a less favorable deal.  The clock is ticking, and this offer gives us both something."
