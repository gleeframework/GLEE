Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  I want to minimize the rounds and the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With each round, my share decreases by 20% while Bob's only decreases by 10%.  It's better to take what I can get before the inflation makes it even worse."
