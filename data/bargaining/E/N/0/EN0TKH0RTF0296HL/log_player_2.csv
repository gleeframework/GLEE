"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This deal will only get worse for both of us as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While not ideal, Bob is better off waiting for a better offer. The value decreases faster for Alice, giving Bob leverage in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, your cut is shrinking faster than mine. I'm offering a 55/45 split in your favor. Let's close this deal before it gets worse for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is already getting ridiculous. I'll take a small hit and offer you 4400.  Take it before inflation eats away at your gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is barely better for Bob than his last offer to Alice, and with each round the potential gains decrease significantly, especially for Alice. She is likely getting desperate, and it's in Bob's best interest to take the slightly favorable deal now before Alice offers even less in a future round."
