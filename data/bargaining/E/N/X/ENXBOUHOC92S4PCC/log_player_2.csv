"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but considering the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept this offer yet. I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value your time, but so do I.  Let's split the money closer to 60/40, giving me a slightly larger share for going first."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both value our time. This offer reflects the time pressure, but let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation factor and the fact that I'm likely to get a worse deal in the next round.  It's time to wrap this up!"
