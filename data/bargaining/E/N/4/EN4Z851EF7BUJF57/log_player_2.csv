"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer - 60/40 split. It's a good deal for you considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's worth holding out to see if Alice will be willing to compromise more in future rounds. The inflation will impact her more than it will impact me, so there's room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 55/45 in your favor, but I'm not going to give away more than that. Inflation is a factor for both of us, and I believe this is a fair compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation affects us both, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the difference in our devaluation rates.  I'm proposing 64/36 - it gets us closer to an agreement and still leaves you with a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal split, it's still not quite what I'm aiming for. Inflation is impacting me significantly, and I'm hoping to hold out for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more to get this done.  52/48 is my final offer.  Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm not willing to go any lower.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where this isn't worth it for me anymore. I need you to acknowledge the difference in inflation we're facing.  67/33 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm not willing to accept a deal that's so heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  I'll hold out for a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing more and more with each round.  Let's split the money evenly and call it a day.  This way, we both get something and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.""}
