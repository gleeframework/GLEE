"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure a large portion of the money quickly. I'm hoping this will motivate him to accept, rather than risk a lower share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I have to acknowledge the inflation factor. I'm losing 5% of my potential gain with each round, while Bob is losing 20%. This means my bargaining power is decreasing faster than his. Accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount, and I can't risk waiting for a better offer when the value of the money keeps decreasing."
