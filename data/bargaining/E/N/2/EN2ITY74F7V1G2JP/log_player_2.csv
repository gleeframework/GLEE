Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking.  This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the shrinking number of rounds, steadily decreasing her offer.  We need to show strength and push for a better split, even if it means going down to the wire."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway. This is a fair split, and we're running out of time. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice claims to be ""meeting halfway"", this offer still heavily favors her.  By rejecting this, we signal that we are willing to risk it all for a more equitable split as we enter the final rounds. This makes it more likely for Alice to propose a more favorable deal in the next round to avoid getting $0."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're down to the wire. This is a fair split - take it and we both win, or risk getting nothing at all.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. This offer is fair, and we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let's throw away this opportunity. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but it's time to be realistic.  Alice has not budged much, but we are now in a critical danger zone. If we reject this and she doesn't significantly change her stance in the next round, we risk getting nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum and avoids the worst-case scenario of both of us walking away empty-handed."
