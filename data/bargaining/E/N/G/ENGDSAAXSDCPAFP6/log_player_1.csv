Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and start with a 90/10 split. I figure Bob might accept this in the first round, but if not, I can adjust my offer in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to get more, considering the inflation, getting half the money is still a good deal.  Bob seems to be a fair player, so I'll take his offer."
