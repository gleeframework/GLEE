900000.0,100000.0,"Let's make a deal quickly Bob, this inflation is no joke! A clean 900k for me, and a quick 100k for you. Don't wait around for your money to lose value!",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to split the money fairly, taking into account the inflation.  550k for me, and 450k for you.  This seems like the fairest deal given the circumstances.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the offer, Bob, 'fair' in the face of inflation means accounting for its impact on both of us.  Let's try this again.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'm proposing 700k for me and 300k for you.  Consider this: the longer this goes on, the less your share is actually worth. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this inflation is really hurting me!  I'm offering you 400k and I'll take 600k.  This is the best I can do without losing too much. Let's finalize this quickly, so we can both get our share of the money before it's worth even less.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the inflation is a concern, but your offer doesn't reflect the shrinking value of the pot. I'm willing to be fair, but I need a reasonable deal. Let's try this one last time.",Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is it. I'm offering 650k for me and 350k for you.  This is my final offer.  Take it while it's still worth something significant to you.",Alice,5,
