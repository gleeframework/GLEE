"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly Bob, this inflation is no joke! A clean 900k for me, and a quick 100k for you. Don't wait around for your money to lose value! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is tempting, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  With the inflation, waiting just one round could potentially make a huge difference."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly, taking into account the inflation.  550k for me, and 450k for you.  This seems like the fairest deal given the circumstances.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'm proposing 700k for me and 300k for you.  Consider this: the longer this goes on, the less your share is actually worth. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  While the inflation is a factor, I think I can still get a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, this inflation is really hurting me!  I'm offering you 400k and I'll take 600k.  This is the best I can do without losing too much. Let's finalize this quickly, so we can both get our share of the money before it's worth even less.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. I'm offering 650k for me and 350k for you.  This is my final offer.  Take it while it's still worth something significant to you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a far cry from what I initially hoped for, the inflation is really eating away at the value of my share.  It's time to accept this offer and secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
