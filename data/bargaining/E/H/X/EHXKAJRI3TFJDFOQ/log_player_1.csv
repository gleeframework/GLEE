"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, even if it's a ""generous"" offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to take the risk 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially with the money being worth even less than in the previous round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, meet me here""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still takes into account the reduced value of the money."
