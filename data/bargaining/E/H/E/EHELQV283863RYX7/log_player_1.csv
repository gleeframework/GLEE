"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we both got a little more.  I'll take 60, leaving 40 for you.  It's a fair deal considering inflation is going to start affecting our earnings soon! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already starting to bite!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about taking 40, but I think it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. I'd rather not risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
