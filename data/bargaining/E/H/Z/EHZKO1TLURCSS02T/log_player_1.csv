"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous 40% of the original 100 dollars. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to turn the tables on me! Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll need to adjust my calculation.

In Round 2, the total amount of money is still $100, but it's worth 80% of its original value due to inflation. So, if Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 40
* Bob gain: 60

That means I'll get $32 (40% of $80, which is 80% of the original $100) and Bob will get $48 (60% of $80).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's still a decent split. I'll accept it.
