"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me a majority of the money. Since I have 12 rounds to work with, I want to get the best deal possible for myself.  I think Bob might accept this offer, but if not, I'll adjust it in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a more even split, I still believe I can get a better deal for myself.  I'm going to try to push for a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly lower split than my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob is seeing the value of getting some money now rather than risking it all on a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While Bob is getting a larger share, he's also getting a decreasing amount of money with each round. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount than my previous offer, but I'm still hoping to get a significant portion of the money. With each round, the value of the money decreases for Bob, so I think he'll be more willing to accept a smaller amount than before."
