Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's move on from here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is starting to move in the right direction, this offer is still heavily skewed in his favor due to the inflation rates. I need to hold out for a better deal, as accepting this would still mean losing a significant portion of the potential gains to inflation."
