7000.0,3000.0,I propose we split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This seems fair given the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the risk of inflation.  We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the value dropping further.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,I suggest we split the money equally. It's fair and ensures both of us benefit from the division without risking more than necessary due to inflation.,Alice,3,
