"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. We can adjust later if you want to keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 dollars is a decent amount, Bob can likely do better with further negotiation. The threat of inflation and the possibility of getting more in a later round makes rejecting a good strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 65/35. This way we both get a decent share and can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 65/35 split isn't ideal, it's better than the 36% reduction in value from the previous round.  It's time to secure a share before the value drops further."
