"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both lose money with each round. It's a better deal for both of us than your last offer, and it gives us a good chance to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
