Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a very generous offer in the first round. I hope Bob sees this as a fair starting point and accepts, avoiding the risk of inflation and potential losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less generous than my initial proposal, accepting it now is the best option.  With the risk of inflation, it's better to secure a sizable portion of the money rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
