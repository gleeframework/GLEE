"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'm keeping $80, which is 80% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have the rest. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, $40 is equivalent to $38.4 in the original value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a good starting point as Bob said. I'll accept the offer.
