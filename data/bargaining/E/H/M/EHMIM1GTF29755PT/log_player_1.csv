"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my offer so quickly!

Considering the new offer, I think I can do better than 200,000. Here's my response:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time!""
