**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting worse for her due to inflation.  While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, time is on our side. We're not losing any value from the original $100, but she is. It's worth holding out for a better deal in the next round."

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's be realistic. This is a good offer considering the inflation.""}
