"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very uneven split. This is a risky strategy, but it's a gamble.  I'm hoping that Bob will be greedy and think he can get a better deal in the next round, only to find out that inflation has eaten away at his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than what I would be able to get in the next round, even with inflation.  It's still not a great deal, but it's the most sensible option at this point."
