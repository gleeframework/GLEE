"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation.

After calculating the new values, I'll have $4000, which is 80% of $5000, and Bob will have $5700, which is 94% of $6000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.
