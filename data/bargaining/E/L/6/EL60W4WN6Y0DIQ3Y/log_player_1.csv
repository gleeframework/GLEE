"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll see the value in a quick and easy split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
