I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split. I believe this is fair, and I'm willing to start with a generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a 700,000$ - 300,000$ split. This is a more balanced deal, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing. We're in the late stages of the game, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's time to take what I can get."
