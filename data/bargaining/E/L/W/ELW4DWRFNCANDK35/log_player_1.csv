I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering I am the one taking the risk of losing value with each passing round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept a 10/90 split, especially since the money I gain is now worth less.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

Let's try a 50/50 split. This is fair considering the inflation and the fact that we both have an equal chance of making the next offer."
