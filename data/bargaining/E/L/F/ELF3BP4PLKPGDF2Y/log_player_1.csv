"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This way, I get the lion's share of the money, but it's a fair offer considering the game is just starting and I'm the first to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was generous, but I'm not getting taken for a ride. I'll give you a fair deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair deal indeed! Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I'll accept his proposal for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
