"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, giving myself the lion's share, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept early to avoid further rounds and potential loss.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially since we have 10 more rounds to play.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I've lowered my demand slightly to be more reasonable. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as the inflation will continue to erode his potential gains with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far less appealing than his previous one. He's clearly trying to leverage the inflation to his advantage. While I'm losing value with each round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal if I keep pushing.  The game is still young, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my demands gradually, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money. Bob has shown he's willing to be stubborn, but with each round, the inflation is making my offers increasingly attractive to him. I believe this offer is a fair compromise that will tempt him into accepting, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable.  While I'm feeling the impact of the inflation, I'm still holding out for a better split. I believe I can get a more equitable deal if I continue to negotiate. We're halfway through the game, and I'm determined to get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. I want to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair share, but I'm not desperate enough to cave in to his demands. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident I can still get a better deal than what he's offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. While I'm feeling the impact of the inflation, I'm still holding out for a better split. I believe I can get a more equitable deal if I continue to negotiate. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I'm determined to get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm running out of time. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of this offer and accept it before the inflation completely destroys the worth of our money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting serious.  The inflation is really hitting hard now, and with only 2 rounds left, there's a very real chance we'll both get nothing.  A 50/50 split is far from ideal, but it's better than walking away empty-handed. I'm accepting this offer."
