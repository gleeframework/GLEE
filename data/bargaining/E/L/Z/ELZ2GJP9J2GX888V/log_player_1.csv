# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with inflation, this deal is bad for me in the long run. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Bob is correct that we are both losing value, but the rate at which I am losing value is much faster.  I need to push for a better deal still, even if it means risking a few more rounds."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's be reasonable and find a solution before we both lose out completely. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is getting too risky.  While I'd prefer a better split, accepting this offer guarantees I get something, and waiting any longer may result in getting nothing at all."
