Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split the remaining value equally and avoid further losses. This is the fairest and most sensible solution at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer will result in a smaller reward for both of us, even if I could secure a slightly larger share.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in future rounds. He might propose an even less favorable deal, putting me in a worse position.
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer is fair. Accepting shows I'm willing to cooperate and prioritize a reasonable outcome over potentially maximizing my own gain at a significant cost."
