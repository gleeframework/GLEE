"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money by 20% for me and 5% for Bob, I have an incentive to try to end the game as quickly as possible to maximize my gain. However, I also need to make an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to consider, taking into account that he might be willing to go to the next round if he believes he can get a better deal. This initial offer is a test of Bob's willingness to negotiate further versus his desire to secure a guaranteed amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the decreasing value of the money. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the value of the money decreases with each round, accepting 450,000 in the second round (which is actually worth less due to inflation) seems less favorable than trying to negotiate for a better split in the next round. Given the significant difference in how inflation affects us, I believe there's room for a more advantageous offer. Additionally, since Bob is also losing value, albeit at a slower rate, he may be inclined to make or accept a more favorable offer in the next round rather than risk further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle to minimize loss""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the ongoing devaluation of the money, I'm making an offer that splits the remaining value evenly between us. This approach aims to appeal to Bob's interest in securing a deal before the money loses further value, while also acknowledging that we both have an incentive to conclude the negotiations sooner rather than later. By meeting in the middle, we can both walk away with a guaranteed amount, mitigating the risk of further losses due to inflation. This offer is a pragmatic approach to ending the game in a mutually beneficial manner."
