"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. The message is to set the tone for the game and make Bob aware that I'm not going to be extremely generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too stingy in the first round, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to make a more generous offer this time around.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but 20% is a bit too low for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 5% less for me now, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. The message is to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Meet me in the middle and we can finish this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle this time around.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. With the money being worth less and less, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, I think I deserve the majority of the pie. Meet my offer or we can keep going!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 45%. The message is to convey that I'm getting more aggressive and willing to take a risk to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing your luck, but I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because the money is worth significantly less now, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting a worse deal. 48% is a decent share, and I think it's better than risking more rounds and getting a smaller share."
