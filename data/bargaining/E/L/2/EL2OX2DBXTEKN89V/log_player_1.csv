"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and in the first round Bob would have gained 4000$, in the second round his gain would be 4000 * 0.9 = 3600$.
However, in this round, Bob is offering 5000$. So, he's actually gaining more than he would have in a 50/50 split in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
