"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% now, but I'm willing to give you a better deal if you counteroffer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain would be 400,000, which is still a significant amount. However, Bob's offer is quite generous, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
