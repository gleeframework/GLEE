"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but it's a good deal for both of us.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. My offer is still generous considering the inflation.  Let's close the deal and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, which is working to my advantage. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to gamble on another round or two.  The inflation will only make her offers more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing my demand significantly to capitalize on Alice's increasingly desperate position due to the higher inflation she faces. By presenting it as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure for her to accept. This offer is risky, but the potential reward outweighs the risk of going another round at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. This offer reflects the time pressure, but ensures we both benefit. Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now approaching a more agreeable split.  The risk of continuing is becoming too significant given the inflation rates. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, even with the accumulated inflation. It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
