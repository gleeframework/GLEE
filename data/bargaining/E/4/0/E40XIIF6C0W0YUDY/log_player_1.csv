Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the pie is shrinking fast! This is my final offer, let's seal the deal before we both lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire! Here's why accepting is the best move now:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The longer we wait, the less money we both get. Accepting a 575,000 USD share now is better than risking an even smaller amount in Round 5.
* **Bob's Stance:**  ""Final offer"" implies he might not budge further. Rejecting could lead to a worse outcome in the next round, even with the proposal advantage.
* **Acceptable Terms:** While not ideal, 575,000 USD is still a significant sum, especially considering the initial offer and how much value has been lost due to inflation."
