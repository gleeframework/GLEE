"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to do better in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and while a fair split is tempting, I believe I can do better in the next round.  Let's see what Alice has to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm confident we can find a more favorable split. This offer is a good starting point that acknowledges both of our needs. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation and the possibility of further rounds leading to even less for me. Let's end this game and both walk away with a good amount."
