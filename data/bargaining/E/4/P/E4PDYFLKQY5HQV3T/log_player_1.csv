"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident we can find a more favorable split. This offer is a good starting point that acknowledges both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: $450,000
Bob's gain: $517,500

Considering Bob's message and the offer, I think he's trying to be conciliatory, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'd like to keep pushing for a better split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

$810,000 for me and $952,500 for Bob.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.""
}
```"
