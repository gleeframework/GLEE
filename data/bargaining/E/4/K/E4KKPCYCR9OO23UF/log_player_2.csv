"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I propose I take $600,000 and you take $400,000. It's a good deal for you to get anything at all this early in the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll come down a bit, you come up a bit.  $550,000 for me, $450,000 for you. We're losing money with each round! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to aim for a more equitable outcome, especially since the devaluation per round isn't drastically high yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 512500,
""alice_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice!  I'm proposing a slightly better split for you than my last offer. Let's seal the deal and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time!  I'm meeting you exactly in the middle now. Any more stalling and we'll both be out a LOT of money! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally offering an even split. While I believe I could have negotiated for slightly more in earlier rounds, the time pressure is significant now. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share, whereas further rejection risks losing everything."
