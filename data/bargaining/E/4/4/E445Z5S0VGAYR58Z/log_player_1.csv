"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost everything, but I'll leave you a dollar to show I'm generous. Accept this and we can both avoid the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{
