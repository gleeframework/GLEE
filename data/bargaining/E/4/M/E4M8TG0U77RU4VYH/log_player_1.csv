This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  Bob is clearly very stubborn and unwilling to negotiate fairly.  

Here's why:

* **The trend is terrible:**  Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for me.
* **Future offers likely worse:** It's unlikely he'll suddenly offer me a better deal in future rounds.
* **Value rapidly declining:** Every round sees my potential share drastically reduced by inflation.

Taking $20 now is much better than risking an even worse outcome, potentially getting stuck with a pittance that's barely worth anything due to inflation.  

While not ideal, accepting prevents a total loss and allows me to salvage something from this unfair negotiation."
