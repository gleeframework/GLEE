Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the offer and I want to maximize my gains. This split still leaves Bob with a decent amount, and it's likely he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation factor. If I reject, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round, as the value of the money continues to decrease."
