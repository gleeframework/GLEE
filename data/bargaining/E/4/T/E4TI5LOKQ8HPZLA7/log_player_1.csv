"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
