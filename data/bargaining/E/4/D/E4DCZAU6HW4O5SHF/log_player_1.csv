Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a kind offer to start, Alice, but how about we try a 60/40 split in my favor? It seems fair considering the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
