"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but a 60/40 split is still too much in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a more balanced outcome.  We both get a decent share, and we avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  55/45 is still too low for me.  I'm proposing 52/48 - it's a small adjustment, but it acknowledges the downward pressure on our potential gains with each passing round.""}
