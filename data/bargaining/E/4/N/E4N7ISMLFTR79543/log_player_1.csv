Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and we can reevaluate as we go.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 500k, and I'll take 500k. Let's keep it simple. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is 400,000. Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is 450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 525k, and I'll take 475k. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 525,000 is worth 51.2% of the original value of 1,000,000, since 525,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.0525 and 0.0525 / 0.8 = 0.065625 * 0.768 (80% * 97.5%) = 0.0512

Bob's gain of 475,000 is worth 47.5% of the original value of 1,000,000, since 475,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.0475 and 0.0475 / 0.9 = 0.052777... * 0.927 (90% * 97.8%) = 0.0475

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
