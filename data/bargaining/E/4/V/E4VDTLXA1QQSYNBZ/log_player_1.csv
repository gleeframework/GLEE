"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too hard.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a relatively fair split, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start moderate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,600 (since it's 10% less than the original $4,000).

I'm not sure if I like this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial high offer. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly lower offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no need to be too aggressive.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,000, which is a more moderate split, and hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting aggressive, I'll try to counter 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,190 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $4,000 from Round 1).

I'm not sure if I like this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my previous high offers. However, I don't want to be too aggressive and risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a good deal.
