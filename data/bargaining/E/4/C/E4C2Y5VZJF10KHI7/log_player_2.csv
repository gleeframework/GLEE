"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I know you want a fair share.  Accept this offer and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's a generous offer from Alice, it's far too unequal. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly this time.  I believe this is a good starting point for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still believe I deserve a larger share.  Let's end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant share and avoids further losses."
