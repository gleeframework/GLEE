Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
