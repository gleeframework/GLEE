"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would get from Bob's 50/50 offer is:

$50 * 0.95 = $47.50

I'd rather wait for a better offer, so I'll reject Bob's proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less due to two rounds of inflation (5% each round), I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still the one making the offer""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the current value of the money, which is worth $90 (since $100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $90.25, but I'll round down to $90 for simplicity)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to four rounds of inflation (5% each round, compounded), the actual amount I would get from Bob's offer is:

$40 * 0.8582 (1 - 0.1426) = $34.33

I'd rather wait for a better offer, so I'll reject Bob's proposal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 19.51% less due to five rounds of inflation (5% each round, compounded), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still the one making the offer, and I think I deserve more""
}
```

This offer gives me 65% of the current value of the money, which is worth $81.05 (since $100 * 0.95^5 = $61.04, but I'll round up to $61.05 for simplicity, then multiply by 1.33 to get 81.05)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less due to six rounds of inflation (5% each round, compounded), the actual amount I would get from Bob's offer is:

$35 * 0.7778 (1 - 0.2262) = $27.17

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit tired of waiting, I'll give you a decent share, but I need more""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the current value of the money, which is worth $59.41 (since $100 * 0.95^7 = $48.41, but I'll round up to $48.41 for simplicity, then multiply by 1.23 to get 59.41)."
