"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since I get to propose first.  Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is fair, since he's still proposing a 60-40 split in his favor, despite me being the one who proposed it first. I think I should get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. I'll aim for a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60-40 split, but I think I deserve a bit more now. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
