"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game quickly and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's split it more fairly 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Since Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
