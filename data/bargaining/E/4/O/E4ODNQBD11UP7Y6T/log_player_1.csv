"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer is a generous one, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. Each of us gets $500,000. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! But I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll do better than that!""
}
```

I'll try to make a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, but don't expect any more!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than the previous one, but I'm still holding back a bit."
