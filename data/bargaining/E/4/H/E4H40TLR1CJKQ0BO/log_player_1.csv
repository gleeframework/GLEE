"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I've included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair split. Let me know what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but I need to feel secure too.  This offer benefits us both, especially with inflation looming. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The 55-45 split in his favor doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can do better in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer a 58-42 split this time, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's previous one. I've included a message suggesting that we meet in the middle to find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
