"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to get a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a more balanced solution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise."
