Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer is a bit more balanced, don't you think?  We can still both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's try to find a compromise. This offer reflects the fact that inflation is impacting us both. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still not in Alice's best interest.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer this goes on, the more Bob is hurt by inflation.  Alice can leverage this.
* **Time Pressure:**  There are only a few rounds left. Bob will likely get more desperate and offer a larger share to Alice soon.

Alice should hold out for a slightly better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** This sends a clear signal to Bob that Alice is serious and won't be lowballed. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, Bob's options are dwindling. The threat of getting nothing might push him to accept. 
* **Inflation Benefit:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, the longer it takes to reach an agreement, the more valuable Alice's share becomes relative to Bob's due to the difference in inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This is my final offer - let's close this out before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a good time for Alice to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Favorable Shift:** Bob's offer has significantly improved and is now slightly in Alice's favor.  
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is increasing. It's better to secure a win now.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more from Bob, the additional gain would be minimal compared to the risk of continued rejection. 

Accepting this offer secures a favorable outcome for Alice before the dwindling value of the money makes the victory meaningless."
