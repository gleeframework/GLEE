"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. I figure it's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob feels it's unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject the offer.  Even with the inflation, 400,000 is still too low for me, considering I proposed 900,000 in the first round.  I'm willing to negotiate, but that offer is too far off from what I think is fair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. I'm offering $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob. This accounts for the inflation and shows I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept the offer. While it's still less than I initially hoped for, considering the inflation, it's a fair compromise. It's better than risking further rounds and ending up with an even smaller share."
