"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, it's a fair and simple start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 50/50 split is a good idea, especially since the money is worth less now. I'd rather wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting 55 dollars and Bob getting 45 dollars. I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not getting left behind! Let's try 55/45 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, and I'm willing to accept the 55/45 split. It's not the best deal, but it's better than what I was getting earlier. I'll take it!"
