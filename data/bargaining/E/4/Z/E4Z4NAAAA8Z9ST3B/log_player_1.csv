"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $55 and Bob gets $45. Given the threat of inflation reducing the value of money by 5% each round, it's beneficial for both of us to close the deal early. My message to Bob emphasizes fairness and the mutual benefit of ending the game quickly to avoid losing value.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's split it down the middle this time! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nSince the offer is not in my favor and the value of money has decreased by 5%, I'll reject this proposal to try and negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers.""}\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money and the previous offers, I'll propose a division where I take $52 and Bob gets $48. This offer is closer to the middle ground between our previous proposals, aiming to find a mutually acceptable compromise. The message to Bob suggests finding a middle ground to end the game before the value decreases further.\n\nYour turn!"
