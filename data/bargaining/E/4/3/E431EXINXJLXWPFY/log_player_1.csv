Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it in terms of the original $100. In that case, Bob is offering me $40, which is 40% of the total. I was initially thinking of a 50/50 split, so this is a significant departure from that.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
