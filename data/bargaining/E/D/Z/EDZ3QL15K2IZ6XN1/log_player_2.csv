"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50-50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll offer a slightly biased deal to see if Alice will accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is still biased towards her, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. But I'll accept this one since it's a relatively small difference from the previous round.
