"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate more if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm keeping the rest, $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 90% of $800,000, which is $720,000.

I don't think I can do better than this offer. I'll accept.
