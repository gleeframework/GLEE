"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose taking $99 for myself and giving Bob $1.  This might seem unfair, but it's a strategic move.  Since I get to propose first, I want to get the most I can, and if Bob rejects, he risks getting nothing at all in the next round.  I'll be willing to negotiate a bit in later rounds if I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's much better to take $50 than risk getting nothing in the next round.  While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split."
