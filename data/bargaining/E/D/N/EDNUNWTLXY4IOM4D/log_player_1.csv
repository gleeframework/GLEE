"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60%, now it's my turn to be more generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like this offer from Bob. He's proposing a 75-25 split, which seems quite skewed in his favor. I'm not willing to accept such a low share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and take a smaller share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly in my favor. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I want a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his offers. I'm not sure I like the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
