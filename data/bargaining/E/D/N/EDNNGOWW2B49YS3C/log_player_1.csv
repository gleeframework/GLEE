"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money, and I'm taking the majority, but still leaving him with a substantial amount. The message is a friendly and reasonable one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. How about we split it 60/40 in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Since I was initially offering Bob $400,000, that's now worth $380,000 in today's value.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 60/40 split, especially since the money I gain is now worth less due to inflation. However, I don't want to risk losing more in subsequent rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 1 is now worth $570,000 (95% of $600,000). I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my share. Let's split it 55/45.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion of the money, while trying to protect my own share from the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous proposal - 70/30 in my favor.  The clock is ticking, so let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 81.74% of what it was in the first round, which is $814,000 (95% * 0.9264). Considering Bob's offer, he's now asking for a 70/30 split, which is even more skewed in his favor than before.

Given the decreasing value of the money over time, I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 3 is now worth $510,000 (81.74% of $623,500). I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 52/48, and we can both walk away with a decent share.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion of the money, while trying to protect my own share from the effects of inflation."
