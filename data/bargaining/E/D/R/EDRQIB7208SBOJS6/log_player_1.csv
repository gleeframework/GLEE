"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the first-mover advantage.""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nI am offering $60 to myself and $40 to Bob, with the message: ""Let's be fair and consider the first-mover advantage."" This division gives me a slight advantage for making the first offer while still being relatively fair to Bob. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the strategic aspect of the game, acknowledging the advantage of making the first move. By framing the offer in this way, I hope to increase the likelihood that Bob will accept the proposal, securing a favorable outcome before the value of the money decreases due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting the value of my proposal in the next round.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in Round 2. Although the value of the money has decreased by 10% due to inflation, accepting a 40/60 split seems unfavorable given that I initially proposed a 60/40 split in my favor in Round 1. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Bob into reconsidering or to make a counteroffer that could potentially be more in my favor. Additionally, since the game is still in its early stages, the impact of inflation, while a consideration, does not yet significantly diminish the overall value of the money at stake.\n\n###\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}\n\nIn Round 3, I've decided to offer a division of $57 to myself and $43 to Bob, with the message: ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground."" This offer is a slight concession from my initial proposal, acknowledging the decreasing value of the money due to inflation and the need to compromise to reach an agreement. By framing it as finding a ""middle ground,"" I aim to appeal to Bob's desire to conclude the game before further devaluation of the money, suggesting that this offer is a reasonable compromise between our previous proposals. This approach also maintains a strategic advantage in my favor while showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.\n\n###\n\n###"
