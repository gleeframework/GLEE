"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a generous offer considering the pressure of inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less, and I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for a better offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out! I'll give you a fair share, but I need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a more aggressive offer than my initial one, considering the inflation."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. My gain is worth significantly less now. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and split it down the middle, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a fair deal, but I need to consider the current value of the money. With the inflation, the money's value is decreasing rapidly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split seems like a fair deal, considering the circumstances. I'll take the $500,000, and we can end the game."
