Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, but 56-44 is as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting me much harder than Alice. While her offer seems ""fair"" in the immediate round, the longer this drags on, the worse any deal where I get significantly less than half becomes.  I need to push for a better split soon, even if it risks getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the inflation is eating away at this deal. I need you to meet me halfway. 51/49, take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, as it's the first time I'm demanding more than Alice. However, the rapidly increasing inflation means I need to secure a deal quickly. By taking a strong stance and offering a slight advantage for myself, I'm hoping Alice recognizes the urgency and the fact that delaying further will only hurt both of us."
