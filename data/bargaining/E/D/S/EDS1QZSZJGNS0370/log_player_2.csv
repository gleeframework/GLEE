"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 60, you get 40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. My message will be: ""I'll take 55, you get 45. That's more fair considering the inflation rates."""
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take 55, you get 45. That's more fair considering the inflation rates.""}\n\n###\nI've made my counteroffer, taking into account the inflation rates that affect both of us. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'll take 55, you take 45. We both lose money with each round, so let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice is losing more value than I am due to the higher inflation rate affecting her share. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. My next message will be: ""Considering the inflation, I think 52 for me and 48 for you is more reasonable now."""
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 52 for me and 48 for you is more reasonable now.""}\n\n###\nI've made another counteroffer, adjusting the amounts to reflect the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Since Alice is losing more value than I am, I believe this offer is more reasonable. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
