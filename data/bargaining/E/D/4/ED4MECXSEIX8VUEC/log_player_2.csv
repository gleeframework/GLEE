"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, I don't want to settle for just 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\n(And, by the way, Alice's message sounds a bit too confident. I'm not buying it.)"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice! I think this is a fair offer considering we both want to get something out of this deal. Plus, with inflation looming, it's better we settle sooner rather than later.""}\n\n###\n\n(I'm trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and highlight the urgency of the situation due to inflation.)\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the difference this time, Bob. Let's make this happen.  Inflation is starting to hurt us both, so we need to settle soon! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although Alice is willing to split the difference, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation is indeed a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk for now.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\n(And, by the way, Alice's message seems a bit misleading - inflation is only hurting me, not her!)\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. Remember, inflation is eating into my share, so I need to get a decent amount to make it worthwhile.""}\n\n###\n\n(I'm trying to convey a sense of urgency and willingness to compromise, while also highlighting the impact of inflation on my share.)\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the end of this game, and I'm feeling the pressure of inflation too. Let's be reasonable. My offer is still generous given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'm not buying Alice's message - she's not feeling the pressure of inflation at all! However, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I need to reassess my strategy.\n\n###\n\nFor now, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll try to come up with a more creative offer to sway Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's cut to the chase. We're running out of time, and inflation is killing my share. I'm willing to split the money 50/50, but I need you to accept this offer now. It's the fairest deal I can offer, considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\n(I'm trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and create a sense of urgency. A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, given the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my share.)\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I hope she'll see the reason in my proposal."
