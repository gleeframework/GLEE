Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make an offer that takes that into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, I'll consider the effective value of the money for me. Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, I'll consider the offer as:

Effective Bob gain: 35 * 0.9048 (1 - 0.0952) = 31.67
Effective Alice gain: 65

I'll accept the offer.
