"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you $1,000, a fair share for a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share to account for potential future losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in Round 2 is worth 80% of the original $9,000 I proposed in Round 1. That's a significant reduction.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain in Round 3 is worth 64% of the original $9,000 I proposed in Round 1 (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's take a chance!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,400 and Bob gets $3,600."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and split the money 50/50, but I think this is a fair and bold move considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the inflation effect, my gain in Round 4 is worth 40.8% of the original $9,000 I proposed in Round 1 (64% of 63.2% = 40.8%). I'll have to think carefully about this 50/50 split.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Splitting the money 50/50 seems like a fair and bold move, considering the inflation. I'm hoping we can both get a decent amount of money out of this deal."
