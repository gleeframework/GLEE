"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very uneven split, aiming to get as much of the money as possible.  Since the money loses value for Bob faster than for me, this initial offer may be tempting for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I proposed in the first round. With inflation, Bob's share is worth less, and I'm getting a decent amount.  I'll take it!"
