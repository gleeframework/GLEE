"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic ultimatum game with a twist of inflation. While 60-40 seems like a bad deal for me on the surface, I need to consider the time value of money and Alice's higher inflation rate.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that's a bit too much for me. How about we meet in the middle at 45-55?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is as low as I can go for now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is barely budging, and the inflation is starting to hurt her more than me. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can get her to come down further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is working against you. I'm offering you 5200, take it or leave it."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced, I'll meet you a bit closer, but I need a better deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but very slowly.  Her inflation rate is significant now, and she has less leverage than she thinks.  I'll hold firm for one more round to see if I can push the advantage further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. My final offer is 5100 for me and 4900 for you.  The inflation is eating away at your share with every passing round, so take this deal before it's too late!""
