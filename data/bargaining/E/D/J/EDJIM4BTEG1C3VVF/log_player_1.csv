"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm being generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll see the sense in accepting this proposal and ending the game quickly, before the money loses value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""bob_gain"": 425000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, last chance before it devalues further""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer, taking into account the inflation, and trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable. I'm hoping the message conveys a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept this proposal before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
