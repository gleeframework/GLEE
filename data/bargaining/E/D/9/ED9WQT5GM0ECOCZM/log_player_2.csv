Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your share is decreasing rapidly with inflation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.

Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the halfway point. This offer still gives you a significant sum, and it's the best you'll get considering the inflation working against you.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting me harder than Alice, I need to hold my ground a little longer.  Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor, but I believe the shrinking pot will make her more open to compromise in the next couple of rounds."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless.  Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  It's the most rational choice considering the time constraint and inflation.""}"
