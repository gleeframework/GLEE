"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000. This way, we both get a decent chunk of money, and we can avoid the hassle of negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks this split is fairer, huh? Well, I'm not so sure...

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather aim for a bigger share to account for the decrease in value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so the total is now $9,000.

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now that the money is worth less. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is 50% of the current $9,000. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
