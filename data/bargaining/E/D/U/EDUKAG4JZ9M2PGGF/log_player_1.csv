"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a generous 40% of the initial $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was too generous, was I?

In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, and Bob's offer is a 50% split, which is a decent compromise. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it now, considering the inflation.

I'll reject the offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less for me now, so I need to be more careful with my offer.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I'm still keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take control! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is hitting me hard! The money is worth a lot less now.

Bob's offer is a 60% split, which is a significant increase in his share. I'm not sure if I should accept it, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I guess I was being too greedy. Better to cut my losses.""
}
```"
