"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, but I'm taking the lion's share because I want to secure a decent amount before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is slightly worse for me than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept a worse deal after he rejected my initial offer. I'm hoping he'll come back with a better deal in the next round, or that the inflation pressure will convince him to accept a less favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming for a compromise while keeping in mind the inflation. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal before the inflation further diminishes the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting worse, the inflation is hitting him harder. I need to secure a deal before the inflation makes it completely worthless. I'll take this offer and hope for the best."
