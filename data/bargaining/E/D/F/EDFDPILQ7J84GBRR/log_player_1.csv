"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". This is a generous offer that gives Bob a significant share while still reflecting my advantage in the game due to the lower inflation rate for me. The goal is to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering that the value of the money decreases with each round, especially for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems more even, I need to consider the impact of inflation on the value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round, especially given the higher depreciation of Bob's share. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Bob into making a more favorable proposal in the subsequent rounds, taking into account the increasing loss of value for both of us, but more significantly for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's be realistic""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4,200 and take $5,800 for myself, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's be realistic"". Given the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on Bob's share, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer compared to the first round. This proposal still gives Bob a considerable amount but acknowledges the depreciating value of the money, aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, who faces a higher rate of depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than that. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's willingness to compromise, the proposed division of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for Bob doesn't adequately reflect the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money. Given that the money I gain is now worth 27.1% less and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I believe Bob's offer doesn't sufficiently account for the disproportionate depreciation of his share. By rejecting this offer, I'm pushing for a more realistic division that considers the substantial decrease in value, especially for Bob, which might prompt him to reconsider and propose a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm being generous""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4,500 and take $5,500 for myself, with the message ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm being generous"". This proposal acknowledges the significant impact of inflation on both our shares but emphasizes my generosity given the circumstances. Since the value of the money continues to depreciate, particularly more so for Bob, I'm attempting to find a balance that might be acceptable to him, considering his higher rate of loss. By positioning my offer as generous, I aim to appeal to Bob's understanding of the situation and the need for a mutually agreeable division before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We need to settle before the inflation wipes out all our gains. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Given that this is Bob's final offer and considering the drastic impact of inflation on the value of the money, I believe accepting this division is the most prudent decision. The money I gain is now worth 40.95% less, and the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, indicating a significant loss of value for both of us, but especially for Bob. Accepting $3,500 for myself and $6,500 for Bob, despite the seemingly uneven split, actually represents a more favorable outcome when adjusted for inflation. Since further rounds would only continue to devalue the money, potentially leading to negligible gains or even a total loss for both of us, accepting this offer secures a tangible, albeit reduced, amount."
