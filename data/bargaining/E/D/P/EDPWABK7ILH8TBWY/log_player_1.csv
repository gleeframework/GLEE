"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm offering a highly skewed division in my favor, aiming to maximize my potential gains. Since Bob doesn't know about the inflation affecting you, he might be tempted to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the offer is still very unfavorable, it's better to accept it than risk getting nothing.  Since the money is worth 20% less to me now,  it's better to take a smaller amount than risk getting nothing in the next rounds."
