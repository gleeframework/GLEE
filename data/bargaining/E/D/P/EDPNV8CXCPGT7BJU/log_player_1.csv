"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the risk I'm taking by rejecting your initial offer. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I still have some room to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
