"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with me getting 90% and you getting 10%. This way, we both get a good amount, and I can justify it by taking on the risk of you rejecting the offer.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the risk I'm taking by rejecting your initial offer. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I still have some room to negotiate further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest way to divide the money, considering the inflation risk and the fact that we've both rejected offers. Let's end this game on an even note. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
