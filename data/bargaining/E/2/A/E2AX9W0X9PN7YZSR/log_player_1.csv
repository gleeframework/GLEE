"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is a strong starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself (90%), but still giving Bob a substantial amount (10%). This is a fair starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that favors me, or if he wants to risk it all and see if he can get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  While I would have gained $900,000 in the first round, I'm now only getting $400,000.  That's a huge loss.  I'm rejecting this offer and will propose a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation.  I'm taking a significant chunk of the money for myself, but I'm trying to find a compromise point that Bob might be willing to accept. We're both losing value with each round, so I need to find a balance between greed and getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  While he's increased my share slightly, it's still far less than what I would have gotten in the first round. I'm holding out for a better deal, and I'm confident that I can still get a good outcome with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a slight step back from my previous offer, lowering my share to 600,000. This is a calculated risk. I'm trying to find a middle ground where Bob might be willing to accept before the inflation eats away at both our potential gains too much. I'm still trying to secure a majority of the money, but I need to find a way to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse. I'm getting a paltry $300,000,  which is significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round. I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With each round, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm now offering a 50/50 split.  This is a drastic change from my earlier offers, but it's the best way to maximize what I can get at this point. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the dwindling value of the money and agree to a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm only receiving $200,000, which is a fraction of what I could have earned in the first round. I'm still hoping to secure a better deal, and I'm not giving up yet. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, but I believe I can still negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a 60/40 split in his favor. With the inflation rate, this is the closest I can get to a fair split, given Bob's history of rejecting my offers. I'm hoping that he'll finally see the value of reaching an agreement before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply unacceptable. While I understand the game is rigged against me, I can't accept a mere $100,000.  The value of the money has plummeted, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

This is my last chance to secure a deal. I'm offering a 70/30 split in Bob's favor.  With just two rounds left, I need to find a way to convince Bob to accept something. The money has lost most of its value, but it's better than getting nothing. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the urgency and take the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is it, my last chance.  I'm getting a tiny amount, but it's better than nothing. I'm accepting this offer, hoping that Bob will be satisfied with his share and that we can both walk away with something."
