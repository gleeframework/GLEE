Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hurting us both, and it's getting worse with each round.  We need to be practical. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, getting $50 is a good deal at this point. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and I don't think I can get a better offer in the next rounds. It's time to be practical and take the 50-50 split."
