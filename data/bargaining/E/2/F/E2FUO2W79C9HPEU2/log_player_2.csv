"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable for us to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the situation.  The value of the money decreases for me each round, so I need a larger share upfront to make it worthwhile.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation. Your offer wasn't in good faith considering the inflation. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need you to do the same. 52/48 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
