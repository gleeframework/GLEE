"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the situation.  The value of the money decreases for me each round, so I need a larger share upfront to make it worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
