"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll aim to get a significant share while leaving Bob with a decent amount. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
