I'm going for a high offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see if Bob is happy with 10% of the pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's likely the money will continue to depreciate rapidly. Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest bet to ensure I get something."
