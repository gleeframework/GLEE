"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and take the rest. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit aggressive, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather get something than nothing. I'll accept this offer.
