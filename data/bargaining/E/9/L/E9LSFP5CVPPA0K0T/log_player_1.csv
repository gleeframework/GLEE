"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With inflation affecting my gains, I need to consider the value of the money I'll get. Since Bob's offer is 60-40, and my gains are worth 20% less, I'll get $32, which is still a decent amount. I'll accept this offer.
