Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a larger portion to make it worthwhile for me.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger portion to make this worthwhile. I think this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting greedier despite the inflation working against him significantly more. I'm holding firm for now, but I need to be prepared to make a more substantial compromise soon before the dwindling value makes any deal unattractive."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a larger portion to make this worthwhile. I think this is a reasonable compromise given the current inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob is clearly getting desperate, and his offer is getting worse for him with each round.  However, accepting such a low offer would mean a significant loss compared to even my last offer. I'm betting on Bob's increasing desperation and the rapidly devaluing pot to push him towards a more reasonable offer."
