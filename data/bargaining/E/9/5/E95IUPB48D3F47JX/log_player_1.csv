Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a small share to start. I'm aiming for the majority of the money, but with inflation in mind, I want to get this deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to secure half the money than risk losing it all to inflation."
