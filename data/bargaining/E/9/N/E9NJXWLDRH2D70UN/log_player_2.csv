Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40.  This seems fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm losing money faster as time goes on.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your inflation is much higher than mine. I'm offering you $45 which is a better deal than what you'll get if we wait any longer.  Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
