Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. An even split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going for an even split 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses a significant chunk of the potential earnings due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Bob needs to hold firm and make it clear that he won't accept an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We are past the halfway point, and Alice is clearly aiming to take the largest share.  While not ideal, this offer gives Bob slightly more than the previous one and sets a firm boundary. The strong message might push Alice to accept,  especially considering the risk of getting nothing if they both continue to be stubborn."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, not me. My offer is still better than yours 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is Bob's enemy now.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation disadvantage, and she knows Bob is desperate. Accepting this offer is far from ideal, but rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in the following rounds, with potentially much greater losses due to inflation. It's better to secure something rather than potentially ending up with nothing."
