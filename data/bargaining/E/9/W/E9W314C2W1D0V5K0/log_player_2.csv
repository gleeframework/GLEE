Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to propose a 7000/3000 split in my favor.  This is a more equitable distribution, and it's likely Alice will accept it to avoid the risk of further inflation."

``` 

While a 50/50 split is tempting, it's still less than my previous offer. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal. With the inflation affecting Alice more, she's likely to become more willing to accept a deal closer to my proposals in the later rounds."

{""bob_gain"": 8500, ""alice_gain"": 1500}

I'm offering 9500/500.  Alice's gains are significantly reduced by inflation, and this offer still gives her something. With only two rounds left, I believe the risk of getting nothing will be a strong motivator for her to accept."
