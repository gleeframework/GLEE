"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share but you get a decent cut. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, the game just started and the difference in value decrease heavily favors Bob in the long run.  Alice needs to be way more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Given the inflation rates, it's a generous offer and gives you a solid amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too lopsided. Let's meet in the middle with a 60/40 split, but in my favor this time. It's a fair deal considering the inflation we're both facing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to pull a fast one!  While she frames it as a compromise, she's simply flipped the unfavorable split she originally offered.  Bob has the inflation advantage and should hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop playing games.  I'm proposing a 58/42 split.  It's a serious offer, slightly better for me than your last, and it accounts for the inflation working in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer, with a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable and avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, but Bob should still hold out.  Alice is finally acknowledging the time pressure, but her offer is still skewed in her favor.  The inflation difference means Bob has a chance to get more than 50% in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're running out of time.  I'm offering a 54/46 split. It's a compromise that recognizes the time pressure and still gives me a slight edge due to the inflation difference.  Take it or leave it.""}"
