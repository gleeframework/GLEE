# Alice's message: Middle ground is not always fair 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While time is ticking, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is a bad strategy. I need to show firmness and hope she starts making more reasonable offers as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 490000, ""alice_gain"": 510000, ""message"": ""This is a compromise. I need you to meet me halfway to close this deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on as we enter the final rounds. I'm offering a slight concession by going below 50%, but this is strategic. It signals a willingness to negotiate but still emphasizes my need for a somewhat fair deal. Alice is likely to become more amenable to a 50/50 split as the clock ticks, and this offer may be just enough to get her to agree before it's too late."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but with only four rounds remaining and inflation eating into my potential gains, I need to make a calculated decision. Accepting a 45/55 split at this point is better than risking getting nothing if we reach round 12. 

While I could hold out hope for a slightly better offer, the risk of Alice sticking to her guns and time running out is too great. It's not ideal, but getting something is better than nothing in this scenario."
