  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Let's see what Bob has to say!"

# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a decent split for you 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money, especially with the inflation factor working against me.
