Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly.  Inflation is a concern, and a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to ensure we both maximize our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
