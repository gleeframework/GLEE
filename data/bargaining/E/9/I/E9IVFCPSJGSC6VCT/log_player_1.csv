**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation. 

* **Round 5 Concerns:** If we reject, in the next round we'll be dealing with a 27.63% reduction in value for us and a  38.9% reduction for Bob. This puts significant pressure on us to make a deal, and Bob knows it.
* **Potential Loss:** Rejecting and proposing in Round 5 leaves us highly susceptible to a lowball offer from Bob, potentially leaving us with even less than his current offer.

It's a tough decision, but in this scenario, accepting ensures a reasonable, albeit not optimal, payout in the face of a rapidly devaluing situation."
