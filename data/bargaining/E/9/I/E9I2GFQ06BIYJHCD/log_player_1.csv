I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping for a quick resolution. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer, and it doesn't seem fair. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal, especially since inflation is hurting him more than me in this round. Let's see if I can get a more favorable proposal next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than before, hoping to incentivize him to accept while still securing a decent portion for myself. This offer also reflects the fact that inflation has hurt Bob more than me, so I'm offering a more equitable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation is hitting Bob harder, his offer is still too low.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we both benefit without risking losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, especially considering the impact of inflation on him. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I need to compromise. I'm offering an even split.  The time pressure and the fact that inflation is hurting Bob much more than me makes this the most logical option.  I'm hoping he sees it that way too."
