"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less, but still a good deal.

I accept Bob's offer.
