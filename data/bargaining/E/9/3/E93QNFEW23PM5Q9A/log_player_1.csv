Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me in the first round.  After all, it's better to get some money than none at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 5000 now, as the inflation will only hurt Bob's offer in the next round."
