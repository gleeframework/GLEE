"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a simple offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'm getting a better deal than in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
