"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but it's still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate in mind, I'll consider the adjusted values. Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less than the original $10,000, his gain of $6,000 is actually $4,800 in real value. Meanwhile, my gain of $4,000 remains the same in real value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, especially considering I'm getting a fixed value while Bob's share is decreasing in real terms."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share for taking the risk of negotiating with you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to find a balance between a fair split and a slightly larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, no more negotiations, let's finalize the split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate in mind, I'll consider the adjusted values. Since Bob's offer is worth 48.8% less than the original $10,000, his gain of $5,000 is actually $2,608 in real value. Meanwhile, my gain of $5,000 remains the same in real value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50-50 split, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of Bob's share due to inflation. I'm willing to settle for a smaller share in real value to avoid further negotiations."
