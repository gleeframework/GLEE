"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much, since the money is worth less already 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give up 1000$ more than I would have in the original split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more in my favor, but still a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to what I initially wanted. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much since the money is worth less and less 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to think about this new offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The offer is still slightly in Bob's favor, and I'm not sure if I want to give up 200$ more than I would have in the original split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 52-48 in his favor, I'll try to make an even more favorable offer for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5100,
  ""bob_gain"": 4900,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to an even split, but I'm still not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 51-49 split, which is even closer to a 50-50 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 22.62% less for Bob, I'll have to think about this new offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob is finally willing to meet me halfway, and I'm willing to accept a 49-51 split. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
