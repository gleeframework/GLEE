"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd rather get a larger share while I still can. Bob's offer is too even, and I'd rather not split it 50/50.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less again, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

I'll try to get a bigger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You rejected my first offer, so I'll take a slightly larger share this time. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this time, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's settle this and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly!

Bob's offer is actually quite close to the initial proposal I made in Round 1, but with the money being worth less now, I'd rather get a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be more aggressive with my proposal.

I'll try to get as much as I can while the going is good. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, so I'll take a larger share. It's now or never!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to take a larger share to avoid further losses, but I won't go lower. Accept this and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is dwindling rapidly!

I've got to think carefully about this one. Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to squeeze out a bit more.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be extremely aggressive with my proposal.

I'll try to get as much as I can, even if it means leaving Bob with a small amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. You've had plenty of chances to make a better deal. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out.  I'm willing to go with a large share, but I'm not going to accept any less.  Let's make a deal before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is almost worthless now!

I've got to think carefully about this one. Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal at this point. I'm not thrilled about giving up 6,000, but I'm also not sure if I can afford to be greedy.

I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk losing everything.
