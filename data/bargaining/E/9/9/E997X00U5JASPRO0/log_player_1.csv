"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

I don't want to give Bob 30 dollars, but I do want to get the most money possible. I'll consider the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
