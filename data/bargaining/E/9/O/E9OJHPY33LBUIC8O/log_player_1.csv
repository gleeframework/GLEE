"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure most of the money.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer a larger share,  it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds.  Bob's offer is still fairly good, and I'm willing to take it to secure some money."
