# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth it for me to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  Even if the offer gets worse for me, it's still possible to get a better deal than 400,000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

It's still too early to accept. I can likely get a better offer from Alice in the next round."

# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the inflation is getting concerning, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm not going to accept this offer so quickly.  Alice is starting to get impatient, but I'll see if I can leverage that to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is really trying to pressure me with the inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. It's getting risky, but I'm willing to gamble that I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm trying to be reasonable here, Alice.  We need to find a middle ground before we both end up with nothing.  Let's split the difference from the last offer and make a deal.""}

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's getting really tight now with the inflation.  While this isn't a great deal, it's better than getting nothing at this point.  I'm accepting the offer."
