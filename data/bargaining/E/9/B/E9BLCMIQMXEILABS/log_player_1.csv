I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see if Bob takes it or risks the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, which is worse than the 60/40 split I offered in the previous round.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  Since the money is losing value, I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, but still giving him a fair share.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
