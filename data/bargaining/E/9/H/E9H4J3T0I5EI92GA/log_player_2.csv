Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, the pressure is on you! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show firmness, or she'll keep lowballing me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome considering the circumstances. Let's end this before we both lose out.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to play hardball.  Alice has shown no willingness to compromise, taking advantage of the inflation working against me. A 50/50 split is fair in principle, and the looming deadline puts pressure on her to accept.  This strong stance might be the push she needs to make a deal."
