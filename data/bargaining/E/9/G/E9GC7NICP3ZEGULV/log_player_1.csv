Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'll reject the offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but not so much that Bob will reject it."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My gain is worth significantly less than it was initially.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

I'll accept this offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.
