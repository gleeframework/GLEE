"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my gain of 3000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
