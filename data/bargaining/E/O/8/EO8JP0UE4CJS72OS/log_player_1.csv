"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss more in later rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate further if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $300,000 x 0.9 = $270,000
Bob gain: $700,000 x 0.9 = $630,000

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not satisfied with the 75-25 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so the actual amounts are:

$270,000 x 0.9 = $243,000
$630,000 x 0.9 = $567,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts in Round 4, considering the 27.1% decrease from the original $1,000,000:

Original $1,000,000 x 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $727,000

So, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $450,000 x 0.727 = $327,015
Bob gain: $550,000 x 0.727 = $399,985

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not satisfied with the 53.5-46.5 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less than in Round 1, so the actual amounts are:

$327,015 (Alice gain) x 0.9 = $294,013.35
$399,985 (Bob gain) x 0.9 = $359,988.15

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, giving me $420,000 and Bob $580,000. The message is a firm but polite one, indicating that I'm willing to compromise but still want a significant share of the remaining money."
