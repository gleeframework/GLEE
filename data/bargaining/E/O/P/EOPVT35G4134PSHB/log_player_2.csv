"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I'll try to use this to my advantage in the next round.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to find a balance that benefits me more.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll calculate the actual value of the money considering the inflation. For me, the money is worth 19% less, so the 400,000 offered by Alice is actually worth around 324,000. For Alice, the money is worth 36% less, so her 600,000 is actually worth around 384,000.\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is reasonable, and it's better to accept it rather than risking another round with even more inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer."
