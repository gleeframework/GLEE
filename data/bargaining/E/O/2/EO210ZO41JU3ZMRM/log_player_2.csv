"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous. Let's end this quickly. 700,000 for me and 300,000 for you.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be fair.  How about a 60/40 split? We can both walk away happy.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  60/40 is too much of a cut for me.  I'm proposing 650,000 for me and 350,000 for you.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting more demanding, but her ""final offer"" bluff doesn't hold much weight this early. With inflation eating into the pot, holding out a bit longer might make her more willing to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we both want a good chunk of this money. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?  It's a strong offer considering the time pressure and inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this is getting ridiculous.  60/40 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. Alice is sticking to her 60/40 demand, and inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. While not ideal, accepting 400,000 now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds where the money will be worth even less."
