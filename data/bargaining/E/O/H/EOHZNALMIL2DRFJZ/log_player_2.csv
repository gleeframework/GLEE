Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5200

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob.  This is practically an even split.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one, but I'll bite and **accept**.

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, inflation eats away at Bob's potential gains. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, getting slightly less than Alice isn't a terrible outcome. Future offers might be even worse, especially if Alice senses Bob's desperation. 
* **Unpredictable Alice:**  There's no guarantee Alice will budge from this offer. She might even start lowballing in later rounds.

It's a gamble, but at this point, securing something is probably better than risking everything for a slightly larger share."
