"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation risk for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. My money loses value faster than hers. It's strategically better to see if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm taking a calculated risk here, but I believe this split is fairer considering the inflation rates. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is decreasing in value slower. Let's find a middle ground before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is slightly better for me than her previous one, it's still not a good deal.  My money is losing value much faster than hers. I need to see if I can negotiate a more favorable split, or at least wait to see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and I'm still losing value faster. I'm proposing a slight increase on my previous offer, hoping we can reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value, but I'm willing to compromise. This is likely the best offer you'll get from me. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the game, and with each passing round, the value of the money is rapidly declining for both of us. While I still prefer a larger share,  this offer is the best I've received from Alice, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me some value, even if it's not ideal."
