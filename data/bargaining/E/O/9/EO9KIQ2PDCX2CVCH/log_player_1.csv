"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as the value of money is decreasing faster for you than for me. This is a fairer split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
