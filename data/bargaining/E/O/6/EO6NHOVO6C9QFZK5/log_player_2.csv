"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal right off the bat. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal for myself!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer is fair and gives us both a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a slight improvement on your offer and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Let's take this deal. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round."
