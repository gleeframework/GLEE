"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $6,000 and Bob receiving $4,000. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40"". I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob doesn't accept this offer. Since inflation will reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds, I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand wanting a larger share, but that split isn't fair to me. How about we meet in the middle? This offer is better for you than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll respond with {""decision"": ""reject""}. Although Bob's offer is closer to a 50-50 split, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate affects Bob's gain more significantly than mine. Meeting in the middle might not be the best option for me at this point, and I'm willing to proceed to the next round to try and secure a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll send my new offer: {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for both of us than waiting""}. In this round, I've slightly decreased my initial offer to 58-42, trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept. My message emphasizes the impact of inflation, suggesting that accepting this offer would be beneficial for both parties rather than prolonging the negotiations.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
