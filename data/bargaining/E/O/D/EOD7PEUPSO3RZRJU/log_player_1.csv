"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60/40""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60/40 split, where I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn!  I'm feeling generous, so let's go with 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, the actual value of my gain would be $4500 * 0.9 = $4050. Considering this, I will reject Bob's offer. I hope to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a split of $5,800 for me and $4,200 for Bob. This is an attempt to find a middle ground between our previous offers, considering the effects of inflation on my gains. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, how about a slight adjustment?  51/49 seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant effect of inflation on my gains, with a 27.1% reduction in value compared to the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and further rounds will only continue to decrease the value of my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
