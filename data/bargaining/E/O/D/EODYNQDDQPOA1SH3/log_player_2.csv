**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  We are already past the halfway point of the rounds, and accepting a deal heavily in her favor this late in the game is risky. I'm betting she'll be more willing to concede as the possibility of getting $0 looms larger."
