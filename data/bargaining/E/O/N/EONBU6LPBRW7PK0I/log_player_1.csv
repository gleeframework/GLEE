```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000

I'm offering you $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. It's a fair offer, don't you think?"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to split the money 50/50. That's a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
