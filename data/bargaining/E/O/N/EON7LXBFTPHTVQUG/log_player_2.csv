Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation disadvantage I have.  It's a strong offer to get us started.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from your last offer. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around my previous offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. While the impact of inflation is increasing, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now sets a bad precedent and suggests I'm willing to settle for less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced split. However, to be fair considering the inflation working against me, I propose we flip your last offer. This reflects the reality of the situation and ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.""}"
