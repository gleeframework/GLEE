"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a good starting point. Let's see if we can improve it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, so I'll have to be a bit more generous to make it worth his while.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
