"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that appeals to fairness. This is a common strategy in negotiation games, as it sets a benchmark for future offers and puts pressure on the other player to either accept or make a counteroffer. By framing it as a ""fair"" offer, I'm also trying to create a psychological anchor that might influence Bob's perception of what a reasonable split looks like. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, I think this is the fairest solution 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer of an even split might seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the effects of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, an even split would actually be less favorable to me than it appears. In nominal terms, I would get $500,000, but in real terms, it's worth less than that. Given this, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the impact of inflation, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money for me. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to adjust the offer accordingly. This time, I'll offer a 58-42 split in my favor, with a message that still emphasizes fairness but also acknowledges the effects of inflation. By doing so, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further for me.\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise""}"
