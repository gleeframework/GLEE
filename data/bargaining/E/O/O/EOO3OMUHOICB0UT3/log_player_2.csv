**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point in the rounds.  Continuing to play the game dramatically increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Decent Offer:** While not ideal, getting $550,000 is still significantly better than nothing. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is making more serious concessions. 
* **Unpredictable Outcome:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer more in subsequent rounds. She might become even more risk-averse and offer a deal less favorable to Bob. 

It's time to take the sure win while it's still a good deal."
