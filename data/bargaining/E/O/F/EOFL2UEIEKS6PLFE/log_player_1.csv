"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I want more for myself! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70 dollars is still worth 70 dollars, but Bob's gain of 30 dollars is worth 28.50 dollars (since it's 5% less).

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, but with a slightly better message to try to persuade Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Come on, let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced split and accept my offer."
