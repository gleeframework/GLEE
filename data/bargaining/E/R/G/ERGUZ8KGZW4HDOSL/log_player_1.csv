"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's go with 5500 for me and 4500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing with each round!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious and consider the long-term implications.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 5% decrease in value for me. I'll aim to keep a larger share of the money to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $3000, but I need to keep $7000 to maintain some purchasing power. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a slight cut from my last offer, but I need at least $6000 to make this worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a smaller share now against the potential risks of waiting for a better offer. Given the significant decrease in the value of money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my decision-making.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of his share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 14.26% decrease in value for me. I'll aim to keep a larger share of the money to compensate for the inflation, but I'll also try to be more realistic about the value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $2500, but I need to keep $7500 to maintain some purchasing power. I'm willing to negotiate further, but this is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to make further concessions if needed!"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's split it 6500 for me, 3500 for you. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a smaller share now against the potential risks of waiting for a better offer. Given the significant decrease in the value of money, I'll have to be very cautious.

However, Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous offers, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
