Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing rapidly. I understand your desire for a larger share, but my previous offer was already a compromise. Let's settle this now with a 55/45 split in my favor. It's the same split you offered, just reversed. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
