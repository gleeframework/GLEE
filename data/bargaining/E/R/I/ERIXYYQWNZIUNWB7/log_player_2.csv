Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, since it's worth the same to me 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offer is slightly better, it's not worth accepting yet. It's better to push for a more even split while I still have some negotiating power. Delay heavily favors Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we're both losing out with each passing round.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, since it's worth the same to me and Bob's offer decreased 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better, especially knowing my offers are getting worse for me with each round. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, is the most logical choice to avoid ending up with nothing.  The longer I wait, the worse my position becomes."
