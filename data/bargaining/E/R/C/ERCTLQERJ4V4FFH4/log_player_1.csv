Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a quick end, I'll give you a better chance to reconsider. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a risky move, but Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to take the gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'll give you 30% this time, but I'm not going any lower.  It's a win-win situation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. No more negotiations, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a good deal, considering the inflation.  While I'd prefer more,  it's better to secure a reasonable share than risk getting nothing at all."
