"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This offer gives me $4,000 and Bob $6,000, which is a relatively fair split, considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll take into account the actual value of the money he's offering me.

My initial gain was $4,000, which is still worth $4,000. Bob's offer is $2,000, which is 50% of my initial gain. I'll accept the offer, as it's a decent split and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
