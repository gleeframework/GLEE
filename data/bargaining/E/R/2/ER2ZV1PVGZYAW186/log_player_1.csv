"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the original amount. I'll take the remaining 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 540,000 (600,000 * 0.9).

However, since the money is worth 10% less again in the second round, the actual amount I would gain from my own share is 360,000 (400,000 * 0.9).

I accept this offer.
