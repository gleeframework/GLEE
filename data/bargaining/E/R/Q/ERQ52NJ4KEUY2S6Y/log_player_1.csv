"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 
 
I'll propose a slightly uneven split, giving myself a small advantage.  This is a common strategy to see if Bob will be willing to accept a deal in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my previous proposal, and it's still early in the game.  I'm not going to settle for a significantly smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'll offer an even split this round.  After Bob's previous proposal, I think he'll be more willing to accept a fair offer.  We're both losing money with each passing round, so it's in our best interest to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not ideal, and we're losing more money with each round. However, I'll hold out for a better deal.  The risk of getting nothing is too high to accept a deal that's far from fair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I'm going to increase my proposed share slightly again. While we're losing money with each passing round, Bob seems unwilling to accept an even split. I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to what I want, but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not appealing. We're losing a substantial amount of money with each passing round, but I believe there is a better deal to be reached. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can come to a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

The inflation is hitting hard now.  I need to start making more aggressive offers. This offer is still pretty even, but it gives me a little more leverage.  We're both losing money fast, and I think Bob will finally be willing to negotiate a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and we're losing a significant amount of money with each passing round. However, I'm still not willing to settle for a deal where I get such a small share. I'm hoping he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is becoming a major factor. I need to push for a more favorable deal for myself. This offer is still close to an even split, but it gives me a significant advantage. I believe Bob will be more willing to accept a deal with less time remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and we're losing more and more money with each passing round. But, I'm not willing to accept this offer.  It's too far from a fair deal, and I believe there's still a chance for us to come to a better agreement.  We only have two rounds left, and I think the pressure will force Bob to reconsider his position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

We're down to the wire, and the inflation is crippling. I'm going for a much larger share this time.  I'm willing to risk it all and see if Bob will finally cave and accept a deal.  If he rejects this, we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a terrible offer, but I'm taking it.  We're both going to lose most of the money anyway because of inflation.  At least with this offer, I get something rather than nothing. It's a lesson learned about the dangers of negotiating with stubborn partners in the face of inflation!"
