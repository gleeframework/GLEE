Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. The inflation is eating away at the value. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
