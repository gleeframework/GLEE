"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm not as concerned about the absolute values as I was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
