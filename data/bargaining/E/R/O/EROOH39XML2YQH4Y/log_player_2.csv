}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a much fairer split considering the time pressure. Don't get greedy! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making a compromise here. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. This is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation. While she says it's her final offer, we still have several rounds to go. I'm betting I can get a better deal than this, even if it takes another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. 45% is the least I'll accept at this point. It's better than risking it all for another round. Let's be done with this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Pressure:**  By now, Alice should be feeling the pressure of inflation.  Each round she delays, the value of her potential winnings diminishes.
* **Firmness:** This offer and message convey firmness without completely shutting down the negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** While I'm aiming higher than my previous 50/50 offer, this still gives Alice a slight advantage, which might make it more palatable under the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation. Accept this offer and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is clearly feeling the heat, and her offer is getting closer to my range.  However, it's still not good enough. I believe her desperation will lead to an even better offer in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing firm. 42% is the absolute minimum I'll accept. The clock is ticking, and neither of us can afford to waste more time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm nudging my offer down slightly to show some flexibility, but not by much. This makes it seem like I'm making a concession while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Increased Urgency:** By emphasizing the time constraint, I'm hoping to make Alice realize that her stubbornness is hurting her more than me. 
* **Finality:** The tone of this message suggests this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, putting the ball firmly in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time, and I'm not accepting anything less. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're down to the wire. With only three rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. 
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** While Alice's offer is still below my ideal, the impact of inflation is significant. Her losses are mounting, and she's clearly feeling the pressure.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  35% isn't ideal, but it's a substantial sum of money. Accepting now guarantees a decent payout and avoids the risk of a complete loss if the negotiations completely fall apart. 
 
It's time to be pragmatic. Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of losing everything at this stage."
