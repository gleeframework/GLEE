"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $500,000 and Bob would receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, a decent start, but I'm hoping for more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer of $400,000 is a decent start, but I was hoping for a better split.

I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still hoping for a better split!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal, offering him $550,000, but I'm still holding out for a more equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, a compromise, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $300,000, but I'm also not eager to continue the game with the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will come back to the negotiating table in the future with a better deal.
