"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to offer you 40$, which is still more than the last round's offer.  We both benefit from a fairer split, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
