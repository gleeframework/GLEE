"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. This seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a bit risky to accept such a deal in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less in the next round.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly, considering the inflation will affect my share in the next round. Let's do 55/45.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance for a decent share! The inflation is eating away at your potential gains. Take the $35 now before it's worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  The inflation is really hurting my potential gains.  I'll take the $35 now before it becomes worth even less."
