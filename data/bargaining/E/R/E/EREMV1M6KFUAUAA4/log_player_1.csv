"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a good share while ensuring Bob gets something as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000, which is more than his previous offer, even with inflation. This should be a better deal for him, and it gives me a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, this offer gives me a substantial amount, especially considering the potential for further reductions in the next round. It's better to secure this sum rather than risk a lower offer or complete loss."
