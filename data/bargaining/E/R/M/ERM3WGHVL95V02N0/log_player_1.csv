"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain. But I'd rather not risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal. I'll accept this offer.
