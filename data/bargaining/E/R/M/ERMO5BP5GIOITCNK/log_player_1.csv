"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll think about it... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation affecting my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a 55/45 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to stick to his 45/55 split. Given the inflation, my potential gains are decreasing rapidly, so I'll think about it carefully...

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept a slightly unfavorable offer now rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
