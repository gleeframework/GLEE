"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather not give up as much as I did in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to be more conservative with my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm being a bit more realistic about the value of money now. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still trying to be reasonable given the inflation. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! With the money being worth less and less, I'll have to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is getting closer to the remaining total, and I don't want to give up too much more.

However, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger either, Bob. Let's make a deal before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a slightly better ratio, but still being cautious about the remaining amount. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, you'll have to make a better offer 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money being worth so much less, I'll have to be extremely cautious. Bob's offer is getting closer to the remaining total, and I don't want to give up too much more.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer, given the rapidly decreasing value of money. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
