Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get as much as possible in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation factor.  I'll take the 50 and move on!"
