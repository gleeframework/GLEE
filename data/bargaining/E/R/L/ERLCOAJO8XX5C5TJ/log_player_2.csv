I'm going to increase my share a bit, but still offer a decent amount to Alice. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her."

I'm going to raise my offer again.  Inflation is clearly working in my favor, so I'm going to try and get a larger share before Alice is forced to accept anything."

Alice is losing a lot due to inflation.  Even though I'd like to see a higher offer, I think it's time to settle for a deal before she's forced to accept something even worse."
