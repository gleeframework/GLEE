Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was far too low. Let's be realistic. I propose 70 for me and 30 for you.  Don't forget, the value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
