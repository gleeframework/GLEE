"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is more fair, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the slightly more even split. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and passing the baton back to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of negotiating. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,900 and leaving $5,100 for Bob, trying to get a slightly better deal this time."
