Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this generous offer, or the deal will keep shrinking for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of Bob's potential gains decreases by 5%.  While my gains remain static, the longer the game goes, the less incentive Bob has to offer me a significant sum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in the hope of getting a slightly better deal in Round 5 is very risky. Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse from my perspective. There's no guarantee he won't offer me even less next round. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum. Holding out for a potentially slightly larger amount carries the risk of ending up with a much smaller amount if Bob continues to lowball. 

While I could push my luck, accepting the current offer secures a decent amount and avoids the potential for further losses due to Bob's shrinking pot."
