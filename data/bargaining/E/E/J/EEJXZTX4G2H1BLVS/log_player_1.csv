"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
 
I propose a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor. I'm confident Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  I'm losing 5% of the value of my potential gains each round, so accepting now before the value drops further is logical."
