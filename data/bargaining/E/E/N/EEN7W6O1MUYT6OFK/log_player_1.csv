"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is meant to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, in the hopes that Bob will accept the offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob has offered to split the money evenly, this seems like a reasonable and fair proposal. Considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, accepting this offer now would be a good decision, rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\nMy response is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
