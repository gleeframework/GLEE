"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm also getting a substantial amount myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my previous one. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth even less in the next round, so I'll aim for a better deal now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
