"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 10%, and we can be done with this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for a measly 10% right off the bat!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm feeling a bit more generous than you, Alice. Let's split it 60/40, and we can call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll come up a bit. How about 70/30?  Let's not drag this on too long. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While 30% isn't ideal, it's better than nothing. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further risk of inflation hitting my share."
