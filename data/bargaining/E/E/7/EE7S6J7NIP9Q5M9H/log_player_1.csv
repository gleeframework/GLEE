"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 600,000 and Bob receives 400,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll try 70-30. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, especially since the money is worth 20% less now. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle at 55-45""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to try to find a more balanced split. I'm willing to give up some of my initial gain to get closer to a 50-50 split."
