Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""}

Despite the reduced value, I think Bob's offer is a decent compromise. Meeting in the middle might not be the most optimal solution, but it's better than continuing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of $5,000 for me and $5,000 for Bob. Let's finalize the deal!"
