"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for us to split the money 60/40. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}\n

I'll try to find a compromise. Since I initially offered 60% for myself and Bob offered 60% for himself, I'll offer 58% for myself this time, which is closer to the middle ground. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
