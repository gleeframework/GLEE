I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  Let's see if he'll accept this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a more even split this time.  Since we're both losing value due to inflation, I think a slightly more even split will be more appealing to Bob.  Hopefully this time he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this split. While the inflation is hurting us both, I'm losing value much faster, so I need to see a more even split before I'll agree."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm willing to go down a little further, but I'm still aiming for a decent share of the pie.  Let's see if Bob is more reasonable this time."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still losing too much value to accept this deal. Bob needs to be more reasonable.  I'm not sure what's going on, but he seems to be getting more and more greedy with each round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to try a more even split again.  The inflation is making the situation dire, but I need to try to salvage as much as I can."
