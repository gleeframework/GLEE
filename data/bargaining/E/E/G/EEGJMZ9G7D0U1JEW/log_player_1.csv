I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share this early in the game. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to try to recover some of the lost ground.  I'm offering $810,000 for myself and $190,000 for Bob.  This is still a generous offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the split is closer to 50/50, I'm still not satisfied. The inflation is eating away at my potential earnings, and I believe I can still do better.  I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount for myself, but still a significant share, at $729,000. This is to try and secure a deal while accounting for the increasing inflation. I believe Bob will recognize the value of securing this deal and accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal at this point.  It's not ideal, but at least I'm walking away with something."
