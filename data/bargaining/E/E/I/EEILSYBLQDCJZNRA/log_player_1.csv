"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in favor of Alice. This gives Bob a small share but hopefully incentivizes him to accept in the first round, avoiding further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best option.  With further rounds, the inflation would hurt me more than it would hurt Bob. This 50/50 split ensures I get at least half the money, and avoids the risk of getting less in future rounds."
