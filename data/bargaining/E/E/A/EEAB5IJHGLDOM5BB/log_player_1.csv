"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as we both get a good chunk.  We can talk about changing it if we want to keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is the one making the proposal this round, I'll decide to reject it and make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. How about a 52-48 split? We can revisit again if needed.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
