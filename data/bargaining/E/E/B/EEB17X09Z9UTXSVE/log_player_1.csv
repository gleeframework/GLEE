"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too greedy, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this one... With the 5% decrease in value, $2500 is now worth $2,375, and $7500 is worth $7,125.

I'm not sure I want to give up that much more money, but I also don't want to risk losing out on a good deal. I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 45-55 split, which is a bit more balanced than my initial offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is losing value fast!

With the 14.26% decrease in value, $3500 is now worth $3,015.10, and $6500 is worth $5,565.50.

I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate... I don't want to risk losing out on a decent deal, but I also don't want to give up too much more.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, let's make it happen!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not giving up too much. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast!

With the 22.62% decrease in value, $4000 is now worth $3,108.80, and $6000 is worth $4,646.80.

I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I still want to hold out for a better deal. I'm not sure I want to give up that much more money, especially considering the value is decreasing so rapidly.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not giving up yet!

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, let's split it 48-52!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a deal done, but I'm not going to give up too much more. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is finally willing to meet me in the middle!

With the 30.17% decrease in value, $5000 is now worth $3,511.75.

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much value, but I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split at this point. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing.
