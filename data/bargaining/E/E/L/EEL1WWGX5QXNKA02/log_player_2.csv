"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. It's a good deal for you considering the inflation!

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's find a middle ground. My new offer is $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you.  Remember, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value with every round. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take a larger share, even though the inflation hits her harder. While the difference seems small, continuing to negotiate could pressure her into a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing money by being stubborn. I'll meet you halfway â€“ $5,500 for me, $4,500 for you. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now much closer to a fair split, especially considering the inflation working against her. Accepting now secures a decent amount, whereas continuing to negotiate carries the risk of getting even less later."
