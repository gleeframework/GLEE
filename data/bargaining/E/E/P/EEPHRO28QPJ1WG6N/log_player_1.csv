"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. This is a fair and simple way to start the game, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight lead, but still leaving you with a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a significant lead, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I don't think 4000 is a fair amount for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but not too much""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to keep the difference between our gains relatively small. I think this offer is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger lead, but still leaving you with something 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is pushing for a bigger lead, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about giving up so much more of the share, and I think Bob is getting too greedy. I'll try to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50/50 split, it's a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to go back to the original 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my gain to get back to a more balanced split."
