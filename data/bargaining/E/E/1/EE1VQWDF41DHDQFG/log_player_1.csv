"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it's worth noting that Bob will only receive 100k, while the rest goes to Alice.  I'm betting that he'll want to see what he can get by rejecting this offer and proposing his own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more generous, but still very favorable to him.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

This is a compromise, but it still favors Alice.  While the inflation has hit harder for Bob, I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has been hitting Bob harder, he's still making a very favorable deal for himself.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm betting on Bob's desperation. The inflation has been hitting him hard, and he may be willing to take a slightly worse deal than his previous offers to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and while this isn't ideal, it's the best offer I've been given so far.  It's time to take the deal and get something before the money gets even less valuable."
