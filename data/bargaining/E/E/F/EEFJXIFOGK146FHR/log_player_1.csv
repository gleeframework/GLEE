"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not sure if it's fair 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than a 70-30 split. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the initial offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 7500 is still a bit too much 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I need to adjust my thinking. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll think in terms of the original amount.

In the first round, I proposed an 80-20 split, which would have given me 8000. Now, considering the inflation, I'd be getting a 7500, which is a good chunk of the original 8000. I think I can live with this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
