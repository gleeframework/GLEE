Let's start with an even split, Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly higher amount this time, but I'll still keep the majority.  It's a risk, but I'm hoping he'll see the value of getting something now rather than waiting and potentially getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation, I'm losing more and more each round. It's better to take what I can get now, even if it's not ideal."
