"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80, you take 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, but I'm offering a relatively small amount to Bob to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50, you take 50. It's a fair and simple split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting my gains!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer. I'd rather settle for a 50-50 split than risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation. Plus, it's a fair offer.

I accept Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
