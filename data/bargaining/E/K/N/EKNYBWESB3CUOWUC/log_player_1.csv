"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll offer a division that slightly favors me to start, considering the impact of inflation. Since I'm making the first offer and considering the value decrease, I'll aim for a bit more than half but still try to be reasonable to encourage acceptance.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, Bob's offer doesn't account for the disproportionate decrease in value I face. Given that my potential gain is worth 20% less and Bob's is only 10% less, I believe a more equitable distribution is necessary.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\nGiven the impact of inflation and the fact that my gain is worth 20% less while Bob's is worth 10% less, I'll adjust my offer to still favor me but be closer to Bob's last offer, hoping to find a middle ground that accounts for our different inflation rates.
