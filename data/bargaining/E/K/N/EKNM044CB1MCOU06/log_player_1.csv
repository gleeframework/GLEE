"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a small share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, with the message that I'm starting with a fair split and giving him a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous, now it's my turn to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not surprised Bob rejected my first offer.

For the second round, considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful. Since Bob's offer is:

```
# Alice gain: 10
# Bob gain: 90
```

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting only $10, which is a significant decrease from the previous round's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too greedy, I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer in the third round will be worth even less than in the second round. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60, with the message that I'm willing to compromise and need a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with each round.

Considering the inflation effect, the value of the money has decreased significantly. My gain of $20 in this round is worth even less than my gain of $10 in the second round.

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting an even smaller share than before, and Bob is getting a larger share. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, I'd like to make another counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth even less than in the previous round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very cautious with my offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $25 and Bob gets $75, with the message that I'm running out of options, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more and more aggressive!

Considering the inflation effect, the value of the money has decreased significantly. My gain of $5 in this round is worth even less than my gain of $25 in the previous round.

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting an extremely small share, and Bob is getting a huge majority of the money. I'd like to make one last attempt to negotiate.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being unreasonable, I'd like to make a final counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth even less than in the previous round. Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll have to be extremely cautious with my offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 10,
  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or we'll end in a stalemate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $10 and Bob gets $90, with the message that this is my final offer and I'd rather end the game than accept anything less."
