"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you'll have to think twice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking 400,000, as it's a 20% decrease from my initial proposal. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
