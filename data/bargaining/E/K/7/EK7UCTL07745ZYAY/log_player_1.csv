"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll start with a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's more greedy.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy. He's essentially offering me a 10/90 split, which is far worse than my initial proposal. I'm not going to settle for that.  I know the inflation affects the money differently for us, but I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still going to keep a significant share. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. He's essentially offering me 30% of the money now, which is even lower than his previous offer. I'm not going to settle for that. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a 60/40 split in my favor.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, and while I want a better deal, I'm realizing I need to be more realistic.  I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to negotiate in good faith."
