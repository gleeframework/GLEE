"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I think I can do better than that. Bob's gain is 60% of the total, which is a bit too high for my taste. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, but still trying to keep the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll try to take more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my previous offers.

Let's see...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Bob's gain is 70% of the total, which is getting too high. I'm not willing to give up that much of the money. I'll wait for his next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground. Can we meet in the middle now?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36-64 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
