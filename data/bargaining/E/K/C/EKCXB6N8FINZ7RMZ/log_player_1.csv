"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob 100,000 dollars and keeping 900,000 for myself.  This gives me a significant share, while still leaving a reasonable amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. Due to inflation, my share is worth less than in the previous round, and if I reject, there's a chance Bob will offer me even less in the next round.  It's better to take what I can get now."
