"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the 30 dollars I would gain in this round is worth less than the 60 dollars I would have gained in the first round. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```
I'm offering to take 45 dollars and leave 55 dollars for Bob."
