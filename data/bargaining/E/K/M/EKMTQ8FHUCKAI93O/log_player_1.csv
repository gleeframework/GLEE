I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since you have to accept a proposal in the next round, this is a safe bet for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Since Bob's offer was significantly worse than mine, I'm confident I can do better. Inflation has hit him harder than me, so a more balanced split is more likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is the most favorable I've seen so far. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and accepting this will ensure I get something while he still gets a majority."
