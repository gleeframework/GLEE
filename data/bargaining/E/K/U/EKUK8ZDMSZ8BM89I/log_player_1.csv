"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script!  60/40 for me this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd still be getting $6,000, but it's now worth less due to inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! 55-45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
