I propose an even split of the money.  It seems fair to start with a simple and equitable offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the initial offer was fair, his proposal is now quite unbalanced in his favor, and I am not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split than Bob's last offer. While I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid further delays, I'm still aiming for a more equitable division."
