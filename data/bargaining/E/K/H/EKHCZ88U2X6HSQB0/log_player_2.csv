"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 60% for me, 40% for you.  We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 20% inflation rate is quite high, so I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a potentially better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation rate, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the high inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not comfortable with that large of a difference. Let's split it more evenly at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The difference between our shares is relatively small, and further negotiations may lead to even greater losses due to inflation. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking a worse outcome in subsequent rounds."
