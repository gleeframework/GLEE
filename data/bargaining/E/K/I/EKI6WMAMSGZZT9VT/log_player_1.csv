"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the original $10,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money I gain is worth 20% less than the original $10,000, which is 0.8 * 6000 = $4800, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the original $10,000, which is 0.9 * 4000 = $3600.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
