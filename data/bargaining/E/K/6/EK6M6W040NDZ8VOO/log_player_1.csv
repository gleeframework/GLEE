Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario.  I'm taking a slightly greedy approach by offering Bob a very small amount.  The reasoning is that he might accept it, but if he rejects it, I'll have the chance to offer him even less in the next round due to inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept.  While I'm getting a tiny amount, it's better than getting nothing.  We're already in the second round, and it's likely that the offers will only get worse for me as inflation kicks in.  I need to cut my losses and take what I can get!"
