"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole $100. You can't do better than that.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to share a little. If you accept, we both get something. If not, we might both end up with nothing in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I think it's a good idea to accept it, since it's a higher amount than what I would get in later rounds due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
