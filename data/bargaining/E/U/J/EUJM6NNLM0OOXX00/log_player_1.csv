"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is still a decent chunk of the total amount, but I'm taking a slightly larger share for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"

# Bob's message: I'm not convinced you're willing to compromise, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his guns and get a slightly better deal. I'm not thrilled about giving him an even larger share, but I'm willing to compromise again.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that he'll be more willing to negotiate in future rounds."
