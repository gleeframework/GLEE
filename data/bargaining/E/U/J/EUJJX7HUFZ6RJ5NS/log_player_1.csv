Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 215687 
# Bob gain: 784313 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees I get something. The inflation factor makes it riskier to reject and hope for a better deal in the next round."
