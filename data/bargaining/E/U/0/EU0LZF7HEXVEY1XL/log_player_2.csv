"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50/50 split. We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a risk to try to get more than 50%. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation, 60/40 seems fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. Let's try 55/45. We both get a little more than last round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has made a compromise, I still think I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, I'm willing to take another risk to try to get more than 45%. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens! Considering the inflation, I'd like to try to get closer to the original 50% or more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'd like to meet in the middle between my previous offer and Alice's. 58/42 seems like a good compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my compromise stance. 52/48 is a better split for us both considering inflation.  Let's end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, Alice's offer of 52/48 is a relatively fair split, and since the money is worth 34.39% less for me now, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round and potentially losing more value. I'll take the 48% and end the negotiation."
