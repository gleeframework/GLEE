"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively even split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a big chunk, but I'm not going to get left with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.
