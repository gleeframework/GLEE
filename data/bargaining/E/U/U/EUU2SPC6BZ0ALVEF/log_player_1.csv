"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game scenario. I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. It's highly likely Bob will accept, as he's getting something rather than nothing.  However, I'm aware of the inflation effect, and I'm hoping he doesn't fully grasp it yet, so I'm taking a very aggressive stance in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed Bob rejected my initial offer, I realize I'm in a weaker position now.  The inflation effect is impacting him more than me, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise in this round.  I'm not sure if he's fully aware of how inflation will impact future rounds, but I'm willing to take what I can get now."
