"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since I'm proposing this round, I'm suggesting a slightly different split where I take slightly more to account for the inflation we both face. We can both still come out ahead, and avoid the risk of further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
