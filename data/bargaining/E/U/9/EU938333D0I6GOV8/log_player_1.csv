"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both lose value with each round. Let's try this and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I understand Bob's point about considering the impact of inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's try again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 50-50 split seems fair considering the decreasing value of money. Let's try this and see if we can agree.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more aggressive move to try to reach an agreement. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
