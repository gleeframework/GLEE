"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. In the second round, the money I gain is worth 80% of the first round's value.

Bob's offer is:

# Alice gain: 100000
# Bob gain: 900000

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 100,000 is actually worth 80,000 in the first round's value. Since this is a better offer than my initial proposal, I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
