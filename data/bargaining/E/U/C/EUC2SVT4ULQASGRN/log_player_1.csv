"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to get as much as possible right away.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to take more, the inflation is a serious factor now.  Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is better than risking getting nothing if we keep going."
