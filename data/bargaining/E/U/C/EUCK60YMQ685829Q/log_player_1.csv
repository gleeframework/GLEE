"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it's a good balance between taking a reasonable share and leaving room for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer the 60/40 split, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get a share of the money, and the next round will further devalue the remaining funds.  It's better to secure 4000 now than risk getting less later."
