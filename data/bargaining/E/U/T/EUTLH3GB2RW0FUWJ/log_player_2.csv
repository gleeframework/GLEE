"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's tempting to take the $10, starting fair means that there's likely more to be gained in future rounds.  Rejecting gives Bob the chance to make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can find a better split where we both get more. Let's try 55/45, a bit closer to even.""}
