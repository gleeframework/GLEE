Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still gives Bob something.  I'll see if he's willing to accept a deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Bob's gains are inflated down, I'm still getting a much smaller share than I was initially proposing.  I'm hoping to negotiate a more even split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my proposed gain and offer a more even split. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement before the inflation gets too high."
