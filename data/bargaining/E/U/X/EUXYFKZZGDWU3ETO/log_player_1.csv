"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of $5000, which is $3800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of $7500, which is $6000.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
