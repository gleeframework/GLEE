"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's better to see if I can get a better deal!  There's still a lot of money at stake, and I need to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation is starting to bite. Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  The longer we wait, the less appealing the deal becomes for both of us, especially you, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even with the inflation, this is a better deal than I can get by rejecting and risking an even worse offer in the next round.  It's time to stop gambling."
