```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

I'll consider Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 48-52 split. The inflation is starting to erode my gains, but I'm not willing to settle for a deal that doesn't give me a significant advantage."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a better deal to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to hurt now!

I'll consider Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. At this point, I'm not sure I can do better, and the inflation is making it harder for me to get a good deal. This 52-48 split seems like the best I can get, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value."
