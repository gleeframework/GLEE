600000.0,400000.0,"Let's split it 60/40. A fair deal for a quick resolution, Bob.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's flip the script - 60/40 my way this time. It's still a fair deal, just with the roles reversed.  What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? 55/45. We both get a decent share, and we avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. 55/45 in my favor feels like a fair compromise, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's get this done before we lose even more!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and losing money.  I'm sticking to a fair split, but let's settle on 52.5/47.5 before inflation eats away any more.",Alice,5,

475000.0,525000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. 52.5/47.5 in my favor feels like a fair deal, considering the losses from inflation.  Let's call it a day and split the money before we lose any more.",Bob,6,

,,,Bob,7,reject
490000.0,510000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to the end. Let's be reasonable and split it 51/49, with me getting the larger share. This way, we both get something before the inflation completely devours our potential earnings.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
505000.0,495000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split. Take it before we both end up with nothing! This is my final offer.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
495000.0,505000.0,"Alice, we're at the 10th round. This is it. I'm willing to give you the larger share, 50.5/49.5. It's time to end this, or we risk losing everything.",Bob,10,
