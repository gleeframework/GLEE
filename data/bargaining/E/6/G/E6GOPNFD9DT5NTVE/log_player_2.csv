Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 70 in this round is equivalent to 70 / 0.64 = 109.375 in the first round. This is a pretty good deal, and I'm not sure if I can do better.
