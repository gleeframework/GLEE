"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slightly bigger share this round, but it's still fair given the inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

Alice's gain: $400,000 (worth 95% of $500,000)
Bob's gain: $600,000 (worth 80% of $750,000)

I'm not thrilled about taking less than 50% of the remaining amount, but I suppose it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
