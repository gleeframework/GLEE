"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly. With the new offer, I'd get $50, which is worth 80% of the original $60 I proposed in the first round.

I'm not sure if this offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decreased value of money. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $100."
