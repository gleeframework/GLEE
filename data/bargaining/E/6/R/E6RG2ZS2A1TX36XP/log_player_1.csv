"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, I will reject it as well.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the actual values of the offer:

Alice's gain: $450,000 (same as before)
Bob's gain: $550,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 27.1% less than the initial $600,000, which is approximately $437,700

This offer is actually worse for me than my previous one, so I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make another offer. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This offer gives us a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable compromise."
