"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to try and get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60-40 split.  Let's try a more even 60-40 split, in my favor this time!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 60-40 split in my favor, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer at least ensures I get something, and it's a better deal than what I could get in the next round."
