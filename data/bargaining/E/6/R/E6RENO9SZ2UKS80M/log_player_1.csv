"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60-40 split.  Let's try a more even 60-40 split, in my favor this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob is being very creative with his proposal. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
