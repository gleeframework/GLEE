"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split, let's see if we can improve from here! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $900,000 is now worth $810,000.

I'm not thrilled about a 50/50 split, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent share. I'll accept Bob's offer.
