Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly now.  Since we both rejected the previous offers, it's time to be fair. This way, we both get something, and avoid further inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
