"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 60/40 in my favor now, since I'm the one making the offer. It's a fair compromise, considering the risk of going into another round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
