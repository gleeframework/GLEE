Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and aiming for an equitable distribution, I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures both parties receive equal value, despite the diminishing worth of money in future rounds.
