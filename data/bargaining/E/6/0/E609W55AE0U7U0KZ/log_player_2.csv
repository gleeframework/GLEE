**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain due to inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. It's a gamble, but I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is hurting you, but I'm not budging much. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic.  Inflation has eaten away at my potential gains, and it's only going to get worse. Accepting a 43/57 split now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. Alice is being stubborn, and there's a good chance she won't budge much more."
