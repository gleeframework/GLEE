{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, considering the value decreases with each round. Let's move closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not satisfied with the offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.
