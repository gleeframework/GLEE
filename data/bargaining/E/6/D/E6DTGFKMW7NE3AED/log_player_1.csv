Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I think this is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{

}
``` 

While splitting it evenly seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. I need to leverage that to get a better deal."

Round 3

{

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to what I want, but still gives you a significant portion. Let's reach an agreement before we lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob is right, we are losing money, and this offer is getting close to a reasonable split considering the inflation working against him. 

However, I need to consider that he's likely feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot more strongly than I am.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more desperate to make a deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  We're both losing money here.  This is a fair deal given the circumstances. Take it while you still can.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to give you less this time, but I need to maximize my gains. This is my final offer. Accept it before we both lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a tough one, but I have to accept. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure, and this is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. If I push further, he might dig in his heels, and we'll both end up with nothing."
