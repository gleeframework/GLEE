Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. Any more time wasted and we'll both regret it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate risks ending up with a much smaller amount, even if I win a larger percentage.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing increases with each rejection. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message suggests he's getting desperate and might not be willing to negotiate fairly anymore. 

A guaranteed $500,000 is better than the risk of walking away with nothing.
