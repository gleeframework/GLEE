"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a 60-40 split, which I hope Bob will find acceptable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get the better deal!

I'll think about it... Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather get a bigger share now to compensate for the loss in value. But 400,000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer.
