"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given your offer.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a slightly larger share. But I also don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money worth even less.

I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the $100 and leaving 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to accept a similar offer to the one I made earlier, but with a slightly better split for me due to the increased inflation.

However, I'm not convinced that 45% is enough, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money. I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in purchasing power.

I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll aim for an even larger share to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally divide the money."
