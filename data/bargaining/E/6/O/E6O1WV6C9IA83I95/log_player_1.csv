"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split which is more reflective of a fair negotiation.  Let's settle this now and avoid further devaluation of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
