Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While accepting $3,000 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer means risking even less in future rounds. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanism and is unlikely to offer a better deal. Accepting now cuts Bob's losses."
