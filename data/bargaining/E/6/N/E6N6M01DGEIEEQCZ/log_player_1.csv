"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game scenario. While it's tempting to split the money evenly,  Alice has a slight advantage here.  By offering a tiny amount to Bob, she increases the likelihood he'll accept, as even $1 is better than nothing in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly better for him, it's still a good deal for Alice. Since the inflation only affects Bob's gains, she's still getting $5 which is more than she would have gotten if she had kept rejecting offers.  It's a strategic move to accept the offer and secure some of the money."
