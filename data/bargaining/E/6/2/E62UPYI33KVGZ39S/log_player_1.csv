"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and leave Bob with 40%, which is $400,000. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer, considering the significant amount of money involved and the potential loss of value due to inflation in subsequent rounds. By framing the offer as ""reasonable,"" Alice hopes to persuade Bob that this division is equitable and worth accepting to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's agree now before things get worse! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, with Bob taking 60% and Alice taking 40%, Alice considers the impact of inflation. The money she would gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, significantly reducing its value compared to what she initially proposed. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only 5% less valuable. Given this imbalance in the devaluation of their shares, Alice believes she can negotiate a better deal despite the risk of further inflation in subsequent rounds. By rejecting the offer, Alice aims to pressure Bob into a more favorable division in the next round, hoping that the threat of continued inflation will make him more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 55% of the money, which is $550,000, and leave Bob with 45%, which is $450,000. The message ""Meet me in the middle before it's too late"" suggests that Alice is willing to compromise and find a middle ground between their previous offers. By emphasizing the urgency of the situation due to inflation, Alice aims to persuade Bob that this is a fair and reasonable offer that they should accept before the money loses even more value in subsequent rounds. This approach seeks to balance the desire for a favorable division with the need to reach an agreement before the inflationary pressure further erodes the value of the money."
