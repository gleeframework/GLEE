I propose Alice gets $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000.  We're nearing the halfway point, and I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further inflation."

``` 
This offer is still too lopsided towards Bob. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I won't accept such a drastic imbalance.  Let's see if we can come to a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose we split the remaining money evenly. Given the significant inflation, it's the most sensible solution to ensure both of us get something substantial."
