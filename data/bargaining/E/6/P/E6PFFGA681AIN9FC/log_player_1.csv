"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer given that the money will be worth less with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
