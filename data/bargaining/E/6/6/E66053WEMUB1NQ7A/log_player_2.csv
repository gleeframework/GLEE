"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but still not quite there 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the deal is getting ""closer"", if I hold out a bit longer, she'll be forced to offer me a larger portion to make up for the inflation losses I'm incurring."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless. I'm taking a small hit on the inflation to make this work. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to settle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is now explicitly using the inflation against me. However, accepting this offer would mean I've lost a significant chunk of the potential gain. I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm willing to risk it all to get a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.

# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me.  While this is far from ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. Alice knows she has the upper hand because of the inflation and is unlikely to offer anything better."
