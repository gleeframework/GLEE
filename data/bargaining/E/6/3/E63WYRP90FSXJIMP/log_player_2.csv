"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share but leave you with something to work with.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal than accept 10% of the total amount, especially considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering I'm taking a hit from inflation.""}\n\n###\nI've proposed a 40% share for myself, taking into account the impact of inflation on the value of the money. This offer is more reasonable and gives Alice a larger share while still considering my own interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal, even considering the impact of inflation. With the value of money decreasing by 36% for me, I need to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I need a larger share to make it fair. This is my best offer yet.""}\n\n###\nI've increased my proposed share to 45%, taking into account the 36% decrease in value due to inflation. This offer is more aggressive, but I believe it's necessary to compensate for the loss in value. I'm hoping Alice will see the reason in my proposal and accept it."
