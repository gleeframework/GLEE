Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, hoping to secure a quick win and avoid the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Inflation will significantly reduce the value of any future gains, and there's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the next round. This ensures a fair split and minimizes losses due to inflation."
