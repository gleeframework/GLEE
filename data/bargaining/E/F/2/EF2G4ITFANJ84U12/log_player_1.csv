"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%. This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
