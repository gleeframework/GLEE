"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is now worth 10% less for me, I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
