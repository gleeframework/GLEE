"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping we can do better in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the $80 I could have gained in the first round is now worth $64. This offer is a bit better than the first one, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, the $64 I could have gained in the second round is now worth $51.60.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Let's see if you'll accept it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. The $80 I could have gained in the first round is now worth $40.80.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'm starting to run out of time and options.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'll be able to get a better deal in future rounds (if there are any)."
