"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split, let's see what you think!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you can't resist my charm! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to charm his way to a bigger share!

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the inflation, my gain of $2000 is actually worth $1900 in real terms, which is a pretty small amount.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your charm isn't strong enough to sway me, let's try again!""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but don't expect me to give you everything!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding onto a bit more. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at my potential gain!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $3000 is actually worth around $2575 in real terms. That's a pretty small amount.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too greedy, Bob!""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. It's time to make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
