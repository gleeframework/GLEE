Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting point, giving me a slight advantage.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting a 50/50 split in the second round is a good outcome.  The value of the money has decreased, and it's likely that rejecting this offer would result in a less favorable outcome for me in future rounds."
