"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point for negotiations. The message is brief and to the point, conveying my proposal clearly. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than your initial offer, but let's be realistic. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal, even though Bob's offer seems reasonable. The fact that the money is worth 20% less to me now means I need to aim higher to get the same value as before. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\nI've taken into account the 20% decrease in the value of the money for me, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that still benefits me. I'm offering a slightly higher share to myself than Bob's previous offer, while still giving him a decent amount. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. The value is decreasing for you each round. This offer is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in the value of the money for me (48.8% less than the initial round), I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer. The longer we negotiate, the less I'll get in real terms. This offer seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. Time to settle!"
