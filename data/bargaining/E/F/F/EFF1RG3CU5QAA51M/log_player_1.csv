"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I want to maximize my share while still ensuring Bob has some incentive to accept the offer. Since the inflation rate is unknown for Bob, I'm assuming he might be more willing to accept a smaller share in the first round. 

I propose a 950,000:50,000 split. This gives me a large majority of the money but leaves Bob with a small portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to have a larger share, it is in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. Considering the 5% inflation, my initial gain of 950,000$ is now worth 902,500$.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me 525,000$, which is still a significant sum.  If I reject, there is no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the money will continue to lose value."
