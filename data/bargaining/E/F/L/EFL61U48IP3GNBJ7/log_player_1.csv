This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation is eating our profits:**  The longer this goes on, the less money we both get. 
* **Bob is unlikely to offer more:** He's dug in his heels twice and is now offering an even split. It's improbable he'll suddenly offer me a significantly better deal in the next round.
* **A sure thing is better than a gamble:** While I might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more out of Bob in another round or two, there's also the risk he gets stubborn and I end up with even less.

Taking the 50/50 split now guarantees a decent outcome, even if it's not the ideal I started with."
