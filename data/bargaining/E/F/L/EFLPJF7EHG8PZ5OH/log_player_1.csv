"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is more fair, and we can get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze Bob's offer. While he claims it's more fair, the inflation is working heavily in my favor. I need to hold out for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for you. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this down the middle.  We can both benefit from a quick and fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob is getting desperate and still not factoring in the inflation. While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, I stand to gain significantly more by waiting him out a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out, especially for you. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to be reasonable.  This offer is a compromise that gives us both a fair share. The longer we wait, the less valuable our money becomes, and that hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a tough decision, but I need to accept. Bob has finally started factoring in the inflation and is unlikely to offer me a better deal. While I could potentially gain more by waiting, the risk of getting nothing at the end is too high."
