"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while ensuring I get a good head start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategic move. The inflation penalty is now in effect, and waiting for another round risks losing more money. A 40/60 split is better than nothing."
