45.0,55.0,"Alice, I think 60/40 is a bit biased. How about we split it 55/45? It's a more even distribution.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, let's be practical. I'm willing to come down a little to 58/42.  Every round that passes hurts us both, though it hurts me a bit more.  We need to find a compromise soon.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway. 52/48 is a fair split, considering the inflation is hurting us both.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're losing serious money with each passing round. I'm offering 55/45. Take it or leave it, but I won't go any lower.",Alice,5,
