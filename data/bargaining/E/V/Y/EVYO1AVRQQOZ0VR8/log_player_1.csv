"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer that's a bit generous.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth less, so I'd better not be too greedy.
