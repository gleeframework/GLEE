"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 50 / 0.95 = 52.63
Bob's gain: 50 / 0.8 = 62.5

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather have more money, even if it's slightly less than the original 50 dollars.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering you 45 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 55 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation rates:

My gain: 45 / 0.8554 = 52.5
Bob's gain: 55 / 0.516 = 106.73

I'll reject this offer because Bob's gain is significantly higher than mine, and I'd rather have a more balanced split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my next offer:

```

}

I'm offering you 42 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 58 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation rates:

My gain: 40 / 0.7738 = 51.76
Bob's gain: 60 / 0.32977 = 181.83

I'll reject this offer because Bob's gain is much higher than mine, and the difference is even more extreme than before. I'll wait for a more balanced offer.
