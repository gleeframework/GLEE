Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gains, even with the inflation factored in. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if she'll offer a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the value for Bob is decreasing significantly with each round.  A 48/52 split is still in Alice's favor, but it's a significant improvement from her previous offers. By framing it as a final offer, it puts pressure on Alice to accept a less ideal deal before the inflation eats away at Bob's potential gains even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the relentless inflation is forcing Bob's hand. While the offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor, rejecting it carries a significant risk. With only five rounds left, there's a real chance of ending up with nothing if Alice continues to lowball. Accepting this offer guarantees Bob at least some profit, even if it's significantly reduced due to the inflation."
