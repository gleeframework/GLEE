"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I take $60, you take $40.  It's better to settle early before inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was too low. Let's be fair, I'll take the larger share this time considering the inflation working against me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting both of us, but it's hitting me harder. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but 55/45 is my bottom line. Take it or leave it, because this money will be worth a lot less tomorrow. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
