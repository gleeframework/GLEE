"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a classic 99/1 split.  It's a high-risk, high-reward move. Hopefully, Bob will be reasonable enough to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair offer. It's better than risking getting nothing, especially with the looming threat of inflation affecting Bob's offer more than mine."
