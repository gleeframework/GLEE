I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation. By the end of the game, the money will be worth significantly less, and I can likely get a better deal by waiting and proposing myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a slightly higher share than you offered me in the first round, let's see if this is more acceptable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it's still not ideal, this offer is more favorable than the previous round. The inflation is starting to take its toll, and it's likely that the offers will only get worse. Accepting now ensures I get something and doesn't risk losing everything."
