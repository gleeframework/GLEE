"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal. Accept this and we can both walk away with a nice sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept. While it seems like a good deal now, with each round the value of the money decreases. There's a strong chance Alice is being overly generous in the hopes of securing a quick deal.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a good chunk of the money, but I need to secure a bit more for myself.  Let's see if we can find a fair split that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to make this worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is slowly decreasing her offer, and the inflation is hurting her more than me. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round, and the potential loss due to inflation is getting real. This seems like a reasonable deal considering the circumstances."
