Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you're still getting a raw deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the absolute values. I'll get $300,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial proposal.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.
