Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm sure I can get a better deal. ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer. Let's split the money fairly, or risk seeing it shrink with each passing round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle and we can avoid further inflation! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting this offer means we both get something and avoid the further devaluation of our winnings due to inflation. It's a good compromise!"
