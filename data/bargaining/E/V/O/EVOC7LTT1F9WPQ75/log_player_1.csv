"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%. My message to Bob is to accept the offer and end the game early, but I'm not sure if he'll be interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer. Let's split the money fairly, or risk seeing it shrink with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less, and Bob is trying to make a fair split. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up 60% of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, I'll try to make a better offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can avoid further inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than before, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
