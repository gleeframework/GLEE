"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with quickly. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a small token. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be more reasonable!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that is more balanced, taking into account that the money loses value for me with each passing round. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in accepting a more equitable division to avoid further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm choosing to reject this offer because, despite the inflation impacting the value of the money I gain, Alice's offer still seems too skewed in her favor. Given the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm motivated to try and negotiate a better split to maximize my real gains. Let's see if I can make a more appealing offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, which now values my gains at 28.1% less than the original amount, I'm adjusting my offer to still aim for a more equitable split while acknowledging the decreasing value of the money for me. I hope Alice recognizes the effort to meet in the middle and accepts this offer to avoid further negotiations that could lead to more significant losses for me."
