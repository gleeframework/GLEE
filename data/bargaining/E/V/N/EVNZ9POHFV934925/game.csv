6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000.  It's better to secure something now than risk losing out later with inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can both get a better deal. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, since inflation will affect your share more heavily than mine.  It's a good compromise, and we can both come out ahead.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation dynamics, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me.  This is my counter-offer:  I get $5,500 and you get $4,500.  It's a better split for me while still giving you a decent share. Time is ticking, and we both lose if we don't agree soon.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than my previous offer, but I still need to secure a majority.  This offer is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a decent amount before inflation eats away at our gains. Let's settle this now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing it all!  I'm willing to compromise further, but you need to move too. This is my final offer: I get $5,200, you get $4,800. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my share. Let's agree now and walk away with something!",Alice,5,
