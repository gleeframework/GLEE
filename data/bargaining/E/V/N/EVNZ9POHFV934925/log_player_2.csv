Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000.  It's better to secure something now than risk losing out later with inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation dynamics, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me.  This is my counter-offer:  I get $5,500 and you get $4,500.  It's a better split for me while still giving you a decent share. Time is ticking, and we both lose if we don't agree soon.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing it all!  I'm willing to compromise further, but you need to move too. This is my final offer: I get $5,200, you get $4,800. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my share. Let's agree now and walk away with something! 
# Bob gain: 4800
