"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll have a chance to negotiate later! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds and if Alice is willing to negotiate a fairer deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a significant portion, but I need to benefit as well. This is a fair starting point for negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time for a compromise.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This seems like a fair deal given the circumstances. Accepting ensures we both get something and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we continue to disagree."
