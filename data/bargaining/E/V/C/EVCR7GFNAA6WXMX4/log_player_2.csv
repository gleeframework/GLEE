"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a measly $1,000! I'll wait to see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm sure you'll find this offer more appealing, Alice. I'm feeling generous, too!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time I'm feeling generous.  Take it while you can, Bob!  The inflation won't be kind to you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not a lot, it's much better than what I would get in the next round. I'll take the $100,000!"
