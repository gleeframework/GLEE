"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose that I receive $800,000 and Bob receives $200,000.  Since inflation is affecting my share, I need to increase my offer to make it worthwhile.  I'm hoping this will be more agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly less than what I could potentially get if we continue to negotiate. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob.  While the inflation is impacting my share, I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  This offer reflects a greater share for Bob while still being reasonable for me given the shrinking value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still confident that we can reach a better agreement. I understand that inflation is impacting my share, but I believe that the potential for future gains is worth the risk of another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. The inflation is starting to significantly affect my share, but I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement before the value of my share diminishes even further. I believe this offer is a fair compromise considering the current circumstances."
