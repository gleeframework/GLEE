"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3

Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and the inflation is eating into my share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and while not ideal, Alice's offer is better than what I might get in the next rounds. If I reject this offer, there's a high chance we might end up with nothing due to the time constraint and Alice's decreasing returns. It's better to secure something rather than risk losing it all."
