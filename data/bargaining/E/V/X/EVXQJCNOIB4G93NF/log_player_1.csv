Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. The value of the money is decreasing with each round, and I'm willing to give you a good amount. Let's avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable amount. While I could try to push for more in another round, the risk is that Bob might offer even less next time due to the decreasing value of the money for him. It's better to accept a decent offer now than risk ending up with a worse deal later."
