"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob.  I'll take 999,999 and give you a single dollar.  It's a fair start, and avoids any unnecessary drama. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While a dollar is better than nothing, the devaluation heavily favors me in later rounds. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that the devaluation hurts you more than me over time. It's a generous offer considering the circumstances, take it while you can.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the devaluation is hitting us both now.  Let's split the remaining money evenly.  It's the fairest solution for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally getting realistic. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in later rounds, a 50/50 split is fair considering the devaluation. It's better to take the sure thing now than risk getting even less later."
