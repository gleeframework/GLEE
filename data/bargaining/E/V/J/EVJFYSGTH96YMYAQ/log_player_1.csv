"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less if you like.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a fair deal, and we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer. My gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $32. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $57.

Considering the inflation, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer as I was initially. However, it's still a decent deal for me. I'll accept this offer.
