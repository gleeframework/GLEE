Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, but I get a little extra for going first. It's only fair since the value decreases over time.

Round 2

""alice_gain"": 4762,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I think we can both agree that an even split is the fairest option after the first round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. An even split is the fairest and most logical outcome. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
