"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess if we want to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, but I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 60/40 is a fair starting point. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 5% less, I'm effectively getting $4,750 (4000 / 0.95). Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he's getting $4,800 (6000 / 0.8).

Considering the inflation adjustment, I think 60/40 is a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 42/58 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 65/35 is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. Since my gain is worth 14.26% less, I'm effectively getting $3,478 (3500 / 0.8626). Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so he's getting $3,412 (6500 / 0.5184).

Considering the significant drop in value, I think 65/35 is still a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. Since my gain is worth 5% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 36/64 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
