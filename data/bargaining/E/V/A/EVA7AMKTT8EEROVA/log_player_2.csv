Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not happy with that split. Let's aim for a bit closer to even, how about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's split it 52.5/47.5.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation. Waiting any longer means both of you will get even less. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  She has stated this is her final offer. There's a good chance if Bob rejects this, she'll stick to it in the next round, leaving Bob with a worse outcome.
* **Close Enough:** The split is relatively close to even. While Bob might be hoping for a slightly better split, the difference is no longer significant enough to justify the risk of further inflation."
