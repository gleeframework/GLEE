"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to give it all away.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, I would have gotten $900,000, but due to inflation, that's now equivalent to $810,000 ($900,000 x 0.9). 

Bob's offer is to split it down the middle, so I would get $500,000, which is a better deal for me than the $810,000 I would have gotten if I had accepted the first offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
