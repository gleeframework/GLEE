"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob! It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept such a lopsided offer, especially since Bob is getting 80% of the remaining amount. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Can we try 60/40?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the majority share, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with this offer, especially since the difference in shares is even more pronounced now. I'm not willing to accept such a small consolation prize when I could potentially get a more substantial share in the next round. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split. Will you reconsider?""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share to Bob, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. Time is running out, and I don't want to leave too much on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet, but I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about this offer, especially since the difference in shares is still so large. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me. I'll try to make one last push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need something in return. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to make a strong case for a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway. This is my last chance to negotiate a decent deal."
