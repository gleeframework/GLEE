Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point. I'm willing to share most of the money, but I hope you'll be reasonable with your counter-offer.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground, I think 60-40 is more reasonable considering the inflation rate is higher for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's split it 55-45.  This offer is still more favorable for you than the last round, and it allows us to avoid further inflation.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer is already quite generous. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, given the inflation rate, accepting this offer is the best way to maximize my gains. If I reject, the next round will significantly reduce the value of the money I receive, making a worse outcome inevitable."
