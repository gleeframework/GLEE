"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values."
