"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. We both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This offer is good for both of us!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is being incredibly stubborn and is clearly banking on me getting increasingly desperate. While the offer isn't terrible considering the inflation, I need to hold out for a better deal. It's risky, but I think Bob might be bluffing about this being his final offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a hit with the inflation, but this is a fair deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. This is a fair split. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split now is far better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Bob knows this, and it was unlikely he was going to offer anything better."
