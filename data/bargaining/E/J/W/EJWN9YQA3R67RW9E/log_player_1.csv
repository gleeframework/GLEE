"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000
