"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 in my favor.""

```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'm not going to accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

Round 5

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me! I'm not going to accept this offer, as it's a tiny fraction of the original amount.

# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to rub it in that I'm getting a tiny share. I'm not going to accept this offer, as it's still a very small fraction of the original amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to make one final push for a better deal.

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is not willing to budge. I'm not going to accept this offer, as it's an insultingly small fraction of the original amount.

I'll reject this offer and end the game, as we've reached the final round and I don't want to accept such a paltry share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I guess we'll both end up with nothing, as we've failed to agree on a division of the money within the 12-round limit."
