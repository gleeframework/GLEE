Let's see how Bob responds.  I'm hoping he'll see the wisdom of accepting my generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that offer.  Bob is getting greedy, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me.  I'll make him a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm still hoping for a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid another round of inflation. Let's see if Bob is ready to accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Ok, I'll take it.  Bob is obviously stubborn, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this game.  At least this is a decent split."
