"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the offer is worse than my initial proposal, inflation is a significant factor.  The money Alice gains is worth 19% less, which is more impactful than the 9.75% decrease in my earnings.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to reject could lead to even worse offers in future rounds. Accepting guarantees me a substantial sum, even with the reduced value due to inflation."
