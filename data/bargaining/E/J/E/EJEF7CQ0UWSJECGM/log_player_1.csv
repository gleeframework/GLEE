I'm going to start with a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer considering the inflation risk. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that gives him a small share, or if he will gamble for a larger share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy. I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 100,000, especially since the inflation is hitting me harder. I'm going to risk it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Bob has shown he is willing to play hardball, so I'm going to increase my share again. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. While I'm still taking the majority, it's a more balanced offer than before. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept before the inflation eats away at our gains further."
