"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you something to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
Alice is being a bit too greedy, and it's only round one! I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair. Let's start with this, and see if we can find a solution we both like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40. I'm starting to feel the inflation, and I don't want us to lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Inflation is hitting hard, and Alice's offer is getting more reasonable. I'll take it."
