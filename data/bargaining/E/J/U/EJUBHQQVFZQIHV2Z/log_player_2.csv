"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky game, and even though Alice's offer is small, it's better to see if she'll offer more in the next round.  The inflation rate might also motivate her to make a more substantial offer in the future."

This is a tough one. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the deadline and the inflation, but I refuse to be squeezed into a corner. I'm still holding out for a better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very tough decision. The pressure is mounting, and I'm losing a significant amount of value with each round. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. Alice might be bluffing, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share just yet."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very difficult decision. While the offer is extremely low, and the inflation is causing my share to plummet, I can't bring myself to accept such an unfair deal. There are only two rounds left, and I'm still hoping Alice will recognize the need for a more reasonable split. It's a gamble, but I'm not giving up yet."
