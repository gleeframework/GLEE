"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and I'll take $8000.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me taking the larger share. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4500 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled about the even split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller share. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
