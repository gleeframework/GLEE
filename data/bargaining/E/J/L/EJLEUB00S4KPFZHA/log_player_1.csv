"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less now, I need to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you. I'd like a more even split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more than 40. This is my best offer so far""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think it's getting close to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less and less, I need to be careful not to give up too much. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. It's not perfect, but it's getting closer to a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
