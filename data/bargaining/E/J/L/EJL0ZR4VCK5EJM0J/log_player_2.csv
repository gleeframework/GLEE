Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable to me. I need to hold strong and push for a larger share in the next round. The longer this goes on, the less her potential gains are worth to her."
