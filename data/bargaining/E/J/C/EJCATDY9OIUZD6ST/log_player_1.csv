"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  This is a pretty generous offer in my mind, but I want to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even though Bob is offering me more than I offered him, I believe I can do better.  Since the value of money is decreasing, I'm better off waiting for another round and seeing what he offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $150,000 and keep $850,000 for myself.  I'm increasing my offer to him slightly, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money. I think this is a good balance between getting a decent amount of money and not risking him rejecting my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly, I think this offer is good enough. Bob is offering a substantial amount to me, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the following rounds. I'm accepting this offer to secure a good amount of money."
