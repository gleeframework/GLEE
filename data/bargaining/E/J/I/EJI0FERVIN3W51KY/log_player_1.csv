"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm proposing that Bob gets 40% of the total amount, which is a significant share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less now. I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 3

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but I'm still trying to be fair and give Bob a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
