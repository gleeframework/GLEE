Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a more than fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it before inflation eats away at any potential gains for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Bob's gains are now worth significantly less due to inflation. He's feeling the pressure, and further rounds will only hurt him more. 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might get desperate and offer even less, hoping you'll crack under pressure.
* **Reasonable Gain:** 450,000 is still a substantial amount. Holding out for a slightly higher gain carries the risk of ending up with significantly less if the negotiations completely break down. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting now secures a decent sum and avoids the potential for greater losses due to Bob's shrinking gains."
