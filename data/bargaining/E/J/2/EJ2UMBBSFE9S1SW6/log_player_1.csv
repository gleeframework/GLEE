"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share of the money, acknowledging the risk of inflation, but also gives Bob a reasonable amount. This may incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While the offer is a 50/50 split, which is less than I received in the first round, I must consider the fact that inflation has already reduced the value of the money I would have earned. Taking 500,000 now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting less in a subsequent round."
