Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm taking the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point.  Accept and we're done. Reject, and we'll see how this plays out.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share.  This is your last chance to avoid further losses.  Accept, or things will get a lot more complicated. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still tilted heavily in her favor.  While I lose money each round, she loses it far faster.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a reasonable offer that saves us both from further losses. Let's be smart and end this here.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly to test Alice's resolve while still offering her the larger share. The message emphasizes the need for a quick resolution due to the shrinking pot. It's a balance between being firm and acknowledging the pressure on both sides."
