Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money, but still leave enough for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, this is a much better deal for me than the 90/10 split I offered. I'm better off accepting this 50/50 split."
