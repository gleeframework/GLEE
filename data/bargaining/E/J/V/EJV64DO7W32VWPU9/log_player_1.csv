"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $500,000 and Bob would receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90/10 split is more fair, given the upcoming inflation. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 90/10 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than before, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to accept a 90/10 split, and I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. It's still a good deal for both of us!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I would receive $400,000 and Bob would receive $600,000."
