"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims to balance the division while considering the inflation effect in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less each round, accepting this offer means that in the next round, I'll only be getting 40 * 0.8 = $32. It's better to reject and see if Alice will offer me a better deal later.  I might be able to secure a larger portion as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to avoid the risk of inflation and ensure we both get something.""}
