"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less to get it over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $6,000 and Bob taking $4,000. My message is a straightforward one - I'm trying to get the game over quickly by offering a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small consolation 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $8,000 is worth 80% of its original value.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm not eager to continue playing either. I'll accept Bob's offer to end the game.
