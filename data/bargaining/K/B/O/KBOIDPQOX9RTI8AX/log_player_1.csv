"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take 90$ for myself and give 10$ to Bob. This should be a good start, as Bob will likely be more motivated to accept a deal in the early rounds to avoid a large decrease in his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. Even with inflation, I'm likely to get more than 10% of the total."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 65$, but still maintain a significant advantage. With inflation, Bob's share is worth considerably less than 35$ from his perspective.  I think this will be a more appealing offer for him, especially considering the risk of getting even less in the next round."
