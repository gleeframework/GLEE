"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a fair offer in my opinion as Bob can agree and get $1000, or disagree and risk getting nothing in future rounds. It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is essentially the reverse of my previous offer. It's tempting, but I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm rejecting the offer and will make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still keeping a large majority. I believe this is a fair compromise given that Bob rejected my initial offer.  This also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, as both of us can still gain something if we reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a very lopsided deal, even with the inflation.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better outcome. I'm rejecting and will make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm reducing my share again to account for inflation but still maintaining a significant portion.  This offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hopefully leading to a deal in this round."
