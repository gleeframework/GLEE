"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take this generous offer and we can end the game early.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my proposals now that the money is worth less.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd rather not give him the majority of the money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round.
