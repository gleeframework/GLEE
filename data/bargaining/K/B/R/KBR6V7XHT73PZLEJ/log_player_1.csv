"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a fair offer, let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 40 dollars, but it's worth the same as 36 dollars due to inflation.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering 55 for myself and 45 for you. I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you can have 45. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer, but with the correct inflation adjustment for Bob's gain. Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, his 55 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars in the first-round dollars.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping for a better split. However, it's still a compromise, and I don't want to reject it and risk getting a worse offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept your offer, but I'm not thrilled about it. I was hoping for a better split.""
}
