"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a good start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. My message is a friendly opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to offer you a slightly better deal than you offered me.  Let's see if you'll accept.  We can both do better with this split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to accept and get a decent share of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
