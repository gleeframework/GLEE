Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a bigger share, even with inflation 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting a worse deal in further rounds. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Alice's gains are losing value quickly. She's motivated to make a deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further rounds mean more risk with potentially smaller gains for Bob, even if he gets a slightly better split.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable amount ($4,300)."
