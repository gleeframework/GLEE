"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that gives him a small amount, or if he'll try to negotiate for a better share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer.  Even though the inflation has reduced my potential gains, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I'm better off taking it than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
