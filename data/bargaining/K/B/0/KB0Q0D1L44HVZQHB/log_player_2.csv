I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get the best deal for myself. 6000/4000 isn't a bad split, but I want more!  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is slightly better for me than the previous round, it's still not what I'm looking for. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has hit me hard,  this offer is close to what I had in mind and it's better than the previous round. I'll accept it and move on."
