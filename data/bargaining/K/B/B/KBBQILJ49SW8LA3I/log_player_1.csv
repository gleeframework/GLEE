Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But inflation is on my side. I'll take 62/38 and we can call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation situation.  While accepting would give me something, it would be a terrible deal compared to what I could have gotten earlier.  My bargaining position weakens with each round, but I need to hold on a bit longer and hope Bob becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""bob_gain"": 5600,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, you win. I'm getting desperate, so I'll agree to 44/56.  But any lower and I'd rather walk away with nothing!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm running out of time. The inflation is steadily chipping away at my potential gain, and Bob knows it. While 44/56 is a significant loss compared to my earlier offers, it's better than going another round and likely getting an even worse deal, or walking away with nothing.  This offer shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to be completely taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I can see you're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down. 65/35 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a brutal situation.  Bob has pushed me to the absolute limit. Accepting this offer means I'm getting significantly less than half the money, but if I reject it, the inflation will hurt me even more in the next round. I strongly suspect Bob won't budge from his 65/35 split, and I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting even less or nothing at all."
