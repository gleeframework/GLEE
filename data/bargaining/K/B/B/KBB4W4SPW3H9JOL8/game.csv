6000.0,4000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with this. A 60/40 split seems fair to get us going. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Hi Alice, I think 60/40 is a bit biased. How about we do 55/45? The money is losing value fast, let's not waste time!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's still not quite there for me.  How about we meet in the middle - 58/42?  We should decide quickly before inflation eats away at the value!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer. Considering the inflation, I think 58/42 is still a bit off. I'm willing to take a bit more, 58/42 the other way around. Let's settle this!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You're severely undervaluing the speed of inflation impacting me.  Let's settle this right now -  55/45.  Take it or leave it, because this is my final offer.",Alice,5,
