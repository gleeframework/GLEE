Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While I would prefer more, the value of the money I would get is dropping rapidly due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I gain something, even if it's not ideal."
