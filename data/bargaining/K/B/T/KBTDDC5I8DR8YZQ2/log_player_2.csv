"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that considers the inflation impact on both of us but still tries to find a middle ground that slightly favors me, given Alice's initial offer and the fact that I'm making this offer before significant inflation impacts us deeply.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's adjust the shares to find a balance.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me given the inflation. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, Alice's proposed share for me is only slightly better than the initial offer, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to find a more favorable division, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both our potential gains.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation and Alice's previous offers, I'll make a counteroffer that still tries to balance our gains but adjusts for the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Alice is more affected by inflation, I'll keep my proposed share slightly higher to incentivize her to accept before the money devalues further.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Let's adjust for the increasing inflation impact. This is a fair offer considering the devaluation we're both facing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and we both lose if this fails. I'm making another fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I believe Alice's current offer is reasonable. The difference in our shares is not drastically different from previous offers, and given the devaluation of money, it's becoming increasingly important to secure a deal. Accepting this offer seems prudent to ensure a gain, despite it not being the most favorable division I had hoped for."
