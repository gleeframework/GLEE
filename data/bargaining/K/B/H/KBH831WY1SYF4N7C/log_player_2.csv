Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting down the middle doesn't account for the fact that my share retains its value, sorry 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While it's getting tight, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better offer as accepting this would be significantly worse than a 50/50 split considering the inflation.  There's still a chance she'll offer a better deal as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 8

{
""bob_gain"": 4800,

""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a deal where you still get more than me, even with the inflation.  Let's be realistic and end this before we both lose out.""

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to settle for less than this 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game is entering a critical stage. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer gives me slightly more than I offered last round. Continuing carries a significant risk of getting even less or nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement."
