I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a small amount to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still fairly generous, and with the inflation factor, the money is worth less with each round. It's a good idea to take what I can get before things get worse."
