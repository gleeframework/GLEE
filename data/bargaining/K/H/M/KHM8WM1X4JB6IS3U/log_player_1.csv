"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can start fresh with the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, and it's better than risking losing everything later on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 56 (70 * 0.8)
* Bob gain: 40 (30 * 0.8)

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split yet, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 44.8 (56 * 0.8)
* Bob gain: 31.2 (40 * 0.8)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
