Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is indeed working against you, Alice. I'll take a bit more, considering the decreasing value for you. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is taking a big toll on your share. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need a larger share to compensate for the rounds we've already played. 
# Alice gain: 390000 
# Bob gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure from inflation is mounting, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half of the initial amount.  I still have some rounds to negotiate a better deal, and Bob is likely aware that I'll be increasingly desperate as the game progresses."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to end this before the inflation gets even worse.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is really on now.  Offering a slight majority to Bob signals that I'm serious about ending the game but not desperate enough to accept a truly unfair deal. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency and accept before the decreasing value makes it truly unprofitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you said the previous offer was your final one, but I'm willing to take the risk. Considering the massive loss in value you're experiencing, I believe this offer is more than fair. Let's end this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is right - the inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. While this offer is far from ideal, it's better to walk away with something than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
