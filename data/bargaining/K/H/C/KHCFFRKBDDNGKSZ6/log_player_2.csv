"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have some leverage to negotiate. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against me, Bob. I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice now, she's actually getting less value than she would have in the first round, even with a larger share. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get an even better offer.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""The inflation is indeed working against you, Alice. I'll take a bit more, considering the decreasing value for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my share a bit more, as the inflation is working in my favor. Alice might be more willing to accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of her share. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. We need to settle this before the inflation eats away at my share. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Despite Alice's attempt to compromise, the inflation is still working heavily against her. With each passing round, her share is worth significantly less, while mine remains the same. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get an even better offer.\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to another rejection!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 610000, ""alice_gain"": 390000, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is taking a big toll on your share. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need a larger share to compensate for the rounds we've already played.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my share again, considering the significant decrease in value for Alice. With each passing round, her share is worth less and less, so I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and risking Alice walking away. Let's see how she reacts to this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to end this before the inflation gets even worse. 
# Bob gain: 510000 
# Alice gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Despite Alice's claim that it's her final offer, I believe she's still willing to negotiate. The inflation is working heavily against her, and she's already lost a significant amount of value. I'll take the risk and wait for the next round to see if I can get an even better offer.\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to another rejection! If she's truly unwilling to negotiate further, I might need to reconsider my strategy in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 630000, ""alice_gain"": 370000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you said the previous offer was your final one, but I'm willing to take the risk. Considering the massive loss in value you're experiencing, I believe this offer is more than fair. Let's end this before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my share again, trying to find the sweet spot where Alice is willing to accept. With the inflation working so heavily against her, I believe she might be more willing to accept this offer, even if it's not ideal for her. Let's see how she reacts! If she rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy for the next round."
