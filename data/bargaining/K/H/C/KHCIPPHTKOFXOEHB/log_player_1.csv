"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer is a bit aggressive, but I want to see how Bob reacts. I figure he might accept, but if not, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, this offer is fair and ensures I get something.  Given the risk of losing everything due to the limited rounds and inflation, I'm taking the safe route and accepting."
