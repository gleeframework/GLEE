"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is my initial offer. I'm keeping the majority, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid potential inflation and risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still hoping to secure a larger portion. I think Bob is likely to accept as the inflation is now impacting his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting. Even though Bob's offer is significantly higher for me than in Round 2, I'm hoping to get a larger share. The inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I believe I can still get a better deal if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further reducing my share, but still hoping to get a decent portion. The inflation is now likely having a serious effect on Bob, and I believe he's more likely to accept this offer."
