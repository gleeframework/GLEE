Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 420000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This is a better deal for you than my last one 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my dwindling returns due to inflation. While she is technically offering a slightly better deal than before, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to risk it all to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is non-negotiable. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You say 50/50 is fair, but inflation is on my side. I'm being generous with this offer 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to budge further, and the difference in our gains is becoming extreme due to the inflation. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds, even though it's far from ideal."
