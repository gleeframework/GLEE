I'm starting off with a generous offer, giving Bob $1000.  I'm hoping he'll accept so we can get this done quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  It's clear Bob is playing a game of chicken here, and I'm not going to give in that easily.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to give him more than 4000.  We both need to be reasonable here."
