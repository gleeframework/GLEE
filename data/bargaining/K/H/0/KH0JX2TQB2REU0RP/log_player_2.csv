Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Given that the money is worth 20% less after one round, I'll offer a slightly smaller share to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Since the money is worth less, I should aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value. However, Alice's offer is still quite close to the initial 50-50 split, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it.
