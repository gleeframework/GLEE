"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will be hitting me harder in the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45% share, even if it's slightly more than my initial offer. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the original $10,000, which is $4,500, and I'll take the remaining $5,500."
