"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, my proposed gain of 6000 in the first round is now worth 6000 * 0.9 = 5400.

Bob's offer is 4000, which is worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I'd rather have 5400 than 3600, so I reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my proposed gain of 5400 in the previous round is now worth 5400 * 0.9 = 4860.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```"
