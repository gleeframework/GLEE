"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, but you still get a nice chunk!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's get this done before things get worse! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me faster than it is against her. It's still worthwhile for me to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking a less favorable outcome in later rounds."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. This is my final offer.  Let's settle before the value of the money plummets further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The rate of inflation is severely cutting into potential gains.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to walk away with something than risk getting nothing in later rounds. Alice has also indicated this is her final offer, making the risk of continuing even higher."
