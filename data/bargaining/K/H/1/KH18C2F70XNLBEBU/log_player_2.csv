"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly with inflation in play. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's crucial we settle this soon.  The value decreases rapidly with each round.  How about $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you? This gives us both a bit more than your previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
