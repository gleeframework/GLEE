6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly with inflation in play.",Alice,1,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's crucial we settle this soon.  The value decreases rapidly with each round.  How about $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you? This gives us both a bit more than your previous offer.",Alice,3,
