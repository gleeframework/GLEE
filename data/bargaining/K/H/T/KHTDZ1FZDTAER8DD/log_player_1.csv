Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game continues, the less the $10,000 is worth. Accepting now cuts losses from further inflation.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's offer is unlikely to improve significantly in future rounds. He's signaled a willingness to compromise, but this is likely near his bottom line.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 5 or later risks Bob becoming more stubborn, potentially leading to an even worse outcome for Alice. 

Taking the $4,200 now guarantees a decent share, even if it means Bob gets slightly more."
