"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, but be prepared to negotiate!""
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split seems reasonable to me.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit though. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the numbers!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""A 50/50 split is a bit too generous for me, I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer, and I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slight edge given my negotiating skills.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 5% inflation from the previous round and adjusts the numbers accordingly."
