"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get the bigger share, since I'm the one making the offer this time. Let's split it 60-40. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to flip the script!

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll take that into account. In real terms, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 400000 / 0.8 = 500000
* Bob gain: 600000 / 0.8 = 750000

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a 55-45 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""
}
