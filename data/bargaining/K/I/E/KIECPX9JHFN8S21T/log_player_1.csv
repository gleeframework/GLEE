Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain as 5000$. The value of the money Bob gains is 7000 * 0.8 = 5600$ (due to 20% inflation).
