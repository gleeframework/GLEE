"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money, or I'll make a better offer next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can avoid going into the next round with a reduced amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the inflation hitting us too hard. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Bob's proposal of splitting it evenly is a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a 10% toll on the money, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take this offer, or I'll make an even better one next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer since it's still a decent amount, and we can both avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both risk losing more money due to inflation. Let's be reasonable and agree on this split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'd like to get a larger share to make up for it.

However, Bob's offer is tempting, and I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation. Considering the current value of the money, his offer is actually a relatively fair one.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
