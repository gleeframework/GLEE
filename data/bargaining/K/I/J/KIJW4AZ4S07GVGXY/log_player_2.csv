"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, Bob loses money to inflation in every round. Accepting $4,000 now is a much worse deal than potentially securing even a slightly larger amount for himself in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split accounts for inflation. Let's close the deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** Bob needs to be aggressive to counter the impact of inflation. Waiting longer significantly reduces the value of the money.
* **Fairness with Urgency:** While this offer tilts in Bob's favor, it's presented with a sense of urgency and a justification based on the shrinking pot.  This might persuade Alice to accept rather than risk getting a smaller amount later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the pressure of inflation to her advantage. While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still unacceptable.  Bob needs to hold out for a larger share, knowing that Alice is also feeling the pressure of each round's devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out - this offer benefits us both. Let's settle and avoid losing more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession, Increased Urgency:** Bob is slightly lowering his demand to show flexibility, but still aiming for a share that combats the inflation losses.
* **Emphasis on Shared Loss:** The message focuses on the risk both players face as the rounds progress.  This framing might push Alice toward a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation affects us both, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, acknowledging the impact of inflation.  However,  Bob is still in a position to push for a better deal.  The rate of inflation is hurting him more, making every round count. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than his initial target."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away any more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Even Split Tactic:** By round 6, the pressure is mounting. Offering a 50/50 split, while not ideal for Bob at the start, becomes a strong strategic move. 
* **Playing on Fairness:**  Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. By proposing a perfectly even split, Bob puts the onus on her to either accept a fair deal or risk losing more to inflation in hopes of a marginal gain later. 
* **Finality and Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that this is a final offer and highlights the increasing risk of delaying a decision.  This urgency might be enough to push Alice towards acceptance."
