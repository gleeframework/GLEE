"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60 dollars and Bob receives 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a lowball, but you can try to do better next round 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll consider the value of the money in the next round. For now, let's assume the value of the money remains the same.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one. Take it or leave it!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's offer. While I'm not thrilled about the 35/65 split, I'm willing to consider it since it's a compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that the next round will bring a better deal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
