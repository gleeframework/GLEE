"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to start with. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a starting offer of $100,000 is better than nothing, Bob is likely to be unsatisfied with such a lopsided split. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and Bob knows that each round that passes will only decrease Alice's offer (due to inflation).  Rejecting and forcing Alice to make a better offer in the next round is a logical move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from it.""}
