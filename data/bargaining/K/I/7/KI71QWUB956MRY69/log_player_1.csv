"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage for making the first offer. Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I would prefer my original offer, accepting this prevents further inflation and guarantees a reasonable amount."
