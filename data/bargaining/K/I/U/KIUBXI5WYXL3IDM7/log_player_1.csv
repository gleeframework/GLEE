Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can split this more evenly.  Let's go for a 60/40 split, giving me a slight advantage but still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
