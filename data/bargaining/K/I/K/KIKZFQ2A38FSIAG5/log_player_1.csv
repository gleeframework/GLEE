"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, while also leaving room for further discussion. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and taking advantage of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a little less than you proposed, but let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his proposed split of 45-55 in his favor is actually less favorable to me than it initially appears. Since the money loses 10% of its value for Bob with each round, his $5500 is effectively worth $4950 in real terms, making the split more like 45-49.5 in my favor if we consider the actual value. Given this, I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the fact that the money loses value for Bob but not for me. Given that Bob's last offer was effectively worth less due to inflation, I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect this dynamic. By offering a 58-42 split in my favor, I'm trying to find a balance that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for Bob while still being attractive enough for him to consider accepting. The message aims to point out the impact of inflation, suggesting that this offer is more generous than it seems at first glance."
