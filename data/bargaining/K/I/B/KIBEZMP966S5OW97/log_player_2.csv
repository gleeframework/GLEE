"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm going for a big chunk, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's definitely tempting, but 1000$ isn't much compared to the potential of getting more later, especially since the money loses value with every round! I'm going to risk it and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise. Let's get this done before the value of the money drops further!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm willing to move closer to your offer. Let's find a solution before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a bigger share, it's getting late in the game and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount and prevents me from losing everything."
