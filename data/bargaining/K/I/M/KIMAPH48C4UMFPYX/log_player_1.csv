"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of $5000, which is $4,750. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of $7,500, which is $6,000. 

I'll accept this offer.
