Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily chipping away at my potential gains while being fully aware of the time pressure and inflation working against me.  It's time to show I'm serious and willing to risk it all to get a fairer deal.  Accepting now would be too much of a loss compared to the initial rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, the pressure is on you due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken now, hoping the inflation will scare me into accepting a bad deal.  However, accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to my earlier proposals. I need to hold my ground for another round and hope she realizes I'm serious about walking away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of the inflation.  I'm offering a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it – I won't go any lower.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a drastic shift in strategy. Alice is banking on my fear of inflation to force a bad deal. Offering an even split accomplishes a few things:

* **Shows Strength:** It demonstrates I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal and won't be bullied by the inflation. 
* **Appeals to Logic:**  It's a clean, easily justifiable split that even Alice can't reasonably argue against.
* **Creates Urgency:** By stating I won't go lower, the ball is firmly in her court. She risks losing everything if she rejects this and I walk in later rounds."
