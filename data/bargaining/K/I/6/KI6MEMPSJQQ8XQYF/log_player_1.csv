"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give you all the power""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my goal, you're getting desperate, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me! My gain is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but I'm getting desperate. I'll accept this offer to try to salvage something.
