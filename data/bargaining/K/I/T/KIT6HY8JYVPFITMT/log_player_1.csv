"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering we have 12 rounds to reach an agreement.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give in to Bob's demands just yet. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. Let's see if you're willing to compromise.""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being open to negotiation."
