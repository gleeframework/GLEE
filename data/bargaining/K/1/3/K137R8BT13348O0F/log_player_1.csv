"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the offer this round 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering I'm getting 20% of the total.

I'll accept Bob's offer for this round:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
