"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 300,000$ gain is tempting, it's important to consider the potential for a better deal. The inflation will eat away at the value of money with each passing round, so it's worth trying to negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm willing to split the money more evenly. Let's work together to find a fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risks and efforts. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation. Accepting ensures a substantial gain with minimal risk of further negotiation losses."
