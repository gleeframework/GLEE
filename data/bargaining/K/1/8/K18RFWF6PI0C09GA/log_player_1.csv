"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself, which is a 70-30 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm willing to split the money more evenly. Let's work together to find a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too uneven for me. I'd like to keep more of the pie. Can you offer something closer to 60-40?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risks and efforts. This is my best offer so far.""
