"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

After considering the reduced value of the money, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, and I'd like to make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new proposal. Considering the further reduction in the value of money due to inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500 and keeping $7,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the offer of $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
