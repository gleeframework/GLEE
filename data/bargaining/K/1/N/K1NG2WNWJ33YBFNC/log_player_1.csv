"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  I figure this is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate.  We have plenty of rounds to go, so I'm not too worried about getting the best possible deal right now.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm losing value with each round, I'm still going to reject this offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but 40% is too low.  I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $30 and keep $70 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer. He rejected my previous offer, but he probably realized that he doesn't have much negotiating power in this game.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'm losing value with each round, 50% is a decent outcome, especially given the uncertainty about Bob's negotiation strategy.  I'm also starting to worry about running out of time.  It's time to take what I can get."
