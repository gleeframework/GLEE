"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to reassess the offer.

I still think $5,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the inflation. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
