"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start low. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the new values:

* My gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too low for me, I'd like to get a bit more.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting that I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more than last time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $45 and Bob getting $55. The message is a friendly nudge, suggesting that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if we can agree here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new values considering the inflation:

* My gain: 50 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145 = 0.855) = 42.75
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273 = 0.727) = 36.35

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle! I accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally divide the money."
