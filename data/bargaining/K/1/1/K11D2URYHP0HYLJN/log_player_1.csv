"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the new offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this case, I'd be getting 40% of the reduced value, which is equivalent to 48% of the original $100.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the reduced value due to inflation, I'll calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less, I'll divide the proposed amounts by 0.7289 (1 - 0.271).

Bob's offer would be equivalent to:

45 / 0.7289 ≈ 61.8%
55 / 0.7289 ≈ 75.5%

I'm not thrilled about this, but I'll accept the offer to avoid further negotiation.
