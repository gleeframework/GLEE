# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is still not in my favor, even considering the inflation for Bob. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal."

# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is still not acceptable. Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation, but the difference in perceived value is significant enough for me to hold out for a better deal."
