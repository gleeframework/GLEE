Let's see if Bob agrees with my proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems like a fair deal at first glance, remember that the money is worth less with each passing round. Since I'm losing value at a faster rate than Bob, I'm better off waiting and seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm raising my share slightly to 70. While I'm losing value faster, I still believe a higher share is possible, especially since Bob rejected my previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
