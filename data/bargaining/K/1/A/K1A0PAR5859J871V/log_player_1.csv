"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'm better off accepting this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
