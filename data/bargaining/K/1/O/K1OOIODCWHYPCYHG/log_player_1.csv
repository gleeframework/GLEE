"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but of course, it's really a pretty standard division of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm willing to give you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation, so my gain of 40 is actually 40% of the new total, which is 80% of the original 100 dollars (since 100 * 0.9 = 90, and 90 * 0.4 = 36, and 36 is 40% of 90).

I'll consider Bob's offer. I'm not thrilled with the 60% share, but it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to Round 3. I'll accept this offer.
