"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share, knowing that the money loses value faster for Bob. I'm hoping he'll take the offer to avoid further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1000, the devaluation of the money is too steep, especially as I can make a counter-offer in the next round. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still keeping the majority.  I'm betting that Bob will see the value of his share declining rapidly and prefer to take this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, I still need to hold out.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that his share is losing value faster than mine.  He's likely to make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm decreasing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a substantial portion of the money. I need to keep the pressure on Bob, and this offer should be tempting enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still have to reject. While the offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is affecting my share more significantly than Bob's. I'm hoping he'll realize that he's losing more value per round and offer me a better deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the inflation rates, this is the fairest outcome given the current circumstances. Both of us are losing value rapidly, and a 50/50 split is the best way to mitigate those losses.  I hope Bob sees reason and accepts this offer."
