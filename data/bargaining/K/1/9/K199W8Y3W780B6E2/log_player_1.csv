I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, knowing that Bob's money will depreciate significantly with each round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, it's unlikely Bob will offer me more in the next round.  The 50/50 split is fair given the inflation."
