Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your game, Bob. But I'm not giving in. We can still find a way to both get a decent share, but time is running out. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting better for me. While 400,000 is a decent chunk, I think I can push for more in the next few rounds. The inflation hurts Alice more than me, so time is on my side."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This offer is still generous considering the inflation working against you.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's cut our losses, Bob.  This offer is fair considering the inflation and the time we've wasted.  We can both still get a decent amount, or we risk getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is the fairest it will get. While I was hoping for a slight advantage, accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable sum.  The inflation is quickly eroding the value of the money, and if I continue to reject offers, we risk walking away with nothing."
