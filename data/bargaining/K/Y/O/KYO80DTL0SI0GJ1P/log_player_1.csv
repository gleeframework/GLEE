Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  The value of the money decreases with each round, so it's in your best interest to accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
