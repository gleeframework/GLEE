"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'm offering a fair split. Accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4750.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest way to start, considering the initial proposal I made was a 4:1 split. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers and the effect of inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since my gain of $4750 in the previous round is now worth 95% of its original value, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60% to me and 40% split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer."
