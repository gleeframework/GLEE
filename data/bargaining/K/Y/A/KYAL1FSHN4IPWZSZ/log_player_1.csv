Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fair 50/50 split. I want to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a 50/50 split, this offer is still better than the 50/50 split with the inflation taken into account."
