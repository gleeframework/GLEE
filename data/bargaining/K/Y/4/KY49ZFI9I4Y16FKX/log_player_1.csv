"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not losing any value, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. This means Bob is getting a slightly better deal than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too big!""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a smaller share, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means Bob is getting a significantly worse deal than in the first round. However, I'm still getting the same amount as in the first round, which is a decent deal.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best one I've seen so far.
