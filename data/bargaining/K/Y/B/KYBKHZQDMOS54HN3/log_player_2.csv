Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both get nothing. Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly using intimidation tactics. While the offer is better than nothing, we still have several rounds to go. There's a chance I can negotiate a better outcome, even if it means waiting until the very last round."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  We're both getting closer to nothing.  Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the same tactic as last time, trying to pressure me with a deadline.  She's retreating towards a more even split, which suggests my strategy is working. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, but I need to be mindful of the shrinking number of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This is as close to the middle as we're going to get.  Take it and let's go celebrate!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the closest we'll get to 50/50.  Take it, or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but it's time to be realistic. Alice is holding firm, and with only a few rounds left, this is the closest we're likely to get to a 50/50 split. Rejecting it risks getting a worse offer or even walking away with nothing.  It's better to secure a good amount now than be greedy and risk losing it all."
