I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  It's a good starting point to see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split this time. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a good share of the money."
