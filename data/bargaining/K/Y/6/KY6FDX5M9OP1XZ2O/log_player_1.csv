"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still gives Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept in the first round, avoiding the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation effect is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and any further rounds would mean a further loss due to inflation."
