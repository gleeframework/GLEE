600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation rate, I think it's a fair deal for a quick agreement. What do you think?",Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. The sooner we agree, the less we'll lose to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to compromise slightly with a 51/49 split.  This is a chance to end this fairly before the inflation eats away more of our potential gains.  Don't you agree?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"I understand we're both losing, but I think I can afford to wait a bit longer. 58/42 is my new proposal. The longer we wait, the more I'll want.",Bob,4,

480000.0,520000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're being incredibly stubborn and we're both losing significant amounts because of it.  I'm offering you 52% - take it or leave it, but this is my final offer. Any more delays and my offers will only get worse for you.",Alice,5,
