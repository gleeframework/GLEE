"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, no haggling!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer.

I'll think about it... Considering the inflation, $4000 is equivalent to $5000 in the first round, which is a decent offer. However, I'd like to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my offer in this round is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is equivalent to $2000 in the first round, which is a relatively low amount. I'd like to get a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
