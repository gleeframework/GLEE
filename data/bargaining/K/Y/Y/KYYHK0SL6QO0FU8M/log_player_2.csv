Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic - time is ticking and we need to find a solution soon. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a slightly better deal, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. Accepting $300,000 now is a much worse outcome than holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds.  I need to signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a more substantial share."

Round 4

{

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but we need to move quickly. This offer is the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on! While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting $400,000 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later, or even worse, walking away with nothing.  Alice seems firm in her position, and the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore."
