"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to split it evenly, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's attempt to negotiate a 60/40 split, especially since I was the one who made the initial proposal. I think I deserve a better deal than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
