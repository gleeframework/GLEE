Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $8,000. I'll make an offer that gives me a larger share, considering the decreasing value of money.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of the original amount, which is $6,400. Alice's offer gives me $4,500, which is a smaller share than I would have liked.

However, I don't know how much Alice's offer is worth to her, considering her inflation rate might be different.

I'll take the offer, hoping it's a good deal for me.
