"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 50% of the original $10,000, which is $5,000. But Bob is proposing that I get $4,000, which is $1,000 less than what I would get in an equal split. Considering the inflation, I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 2, Bob offered me $4,000, which is $1,000 less than the equal split. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the original amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly higher percentage of the original $10,000, while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
