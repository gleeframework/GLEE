"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take the smaller share, it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth 5% less each round, I need to make sure I'm not getting too little. But I also don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! Take a smaller share this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I need to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm not getting as much as I was hoping for.

However, meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even smaller amount.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
