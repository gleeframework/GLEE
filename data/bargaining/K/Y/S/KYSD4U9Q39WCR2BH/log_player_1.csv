"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start. It's a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share than me, especially since he's already rejected my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to make it more favorable to myself. I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keep a significant portion for myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his initial plan of getting a larger share!

However, I'm not going to give in that easily. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. But I do want to try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was again 55-45 in his favor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'll still leave some room for Bob to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to stick to his plan, but the value of his share is decreasing due to inflation.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share than me, especially since he's rejected my previous offers.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, taking into account the decreasing value of Bob's share due to inflation. I'll aim to get a larger share, but I'll still leave some room for Bob to accept.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to stick to his plan, but the value of his share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share than me, especially since he's rejected my previous offers.

But, considering the inflation, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking going to Round 12 and getting nothing.
