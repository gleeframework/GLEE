"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, let's start with a fair base 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation!

However, I think Bob's proposal is a good one. Splitting it down the middle is a fair and reasonable starting point. I'll accept his offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
