"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the fairest way, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to make a counteroffer."

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be generous, but I need to protect my share""
}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40,  a fairer deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to weigh my options carefully. However, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation rates.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, taking into account the reduced value of the money."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a sweet spot, but I need to prioritize my share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to protect my share from the effects of inflation."
