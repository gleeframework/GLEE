"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm proposing a 70-30 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split. I'd like to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the two previous rounds).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm hoping it will be more acceptable to Bob."
