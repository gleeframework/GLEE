"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm proposing that you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  It's a big chunk of the money for me, but it's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and taking $550,000 for myself.  Since we're both losing value with each round, I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I still need a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm still losing a lot of value due to inflation, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I would consider fair. I'd rather get $480,000 now than risk losing even more in the next round."
