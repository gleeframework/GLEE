Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your turn! How about this slightly adjusted split to reflect the time value?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value:**  It's crucial to recognize that delaying an agreement hurts Alice more than it hurts me. Her 20% depreciation rate means she's losing value fast.
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it heavily favored her due to her first-mover advantage. My offer aims for a more balanced split, acknowledging her initial proposal but also the changing dynamics.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** By offering a slight improvement over a 50/50 split, I signal a willingness to negotiate but also establish a stronger position should we move to further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll try to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offer is getting worse for me.  While closer to the middle ground, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid depreciation of the money from her perspective. 
* **Leverage:** Time is on my side. Each round makes accepting a deal less appealing for Alice. My losses are proportionally smaller.
* **Holding Strong:**  I need to signal that I'm not desperate and won't accept an unfair deal just because time is passing. A firm rejection increases the pressure on Alice to make a much more reasonable offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is running out, and this is a very generous offer given the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** By round 4, the depreciation heavily impacts Alice. It's clear she overplayed her hand in the early rounds. My offer, while still a concession from my ideal split, is significantly better than what she could hope for if the game drags on.
* **Strong Stance, But Negotiable:** The message is firm but leaves room for a counter-offer. I'm communicating that I'm aware of my advantageous position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a risk Alice will reject the offer, but the potential downside (slightly less money in future rounds) is outweighed by the potential upside (securing a favorable split now)."
