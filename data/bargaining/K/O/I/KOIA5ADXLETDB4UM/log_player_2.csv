Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a risk for a better deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted. Alice is clearly willing to play hardball, banking on my fear of inflation to force a bad deal.  While accepting would get me *something*, it's a terrible return.  I need to push back hard now before my position weakens further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""The tables have turned, Alice. Time for you to start worrying about inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a bold move, but necessary. Alice is clearly trying to exploit my fear of inflation. By flipping the script and offering a heavily skewed deal in my favor, I'm gambling on two things:

1. **Alice's risk aversion:** She might be more willing to accept a less-than-ideal deal now that the inflation is working more against her.
2. **Future leverage:** Even if she rejects this offer, it sets a new baseline. She knows I'm not afraid to play hardball, which might make her more amenable to a fairer deal in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting both of us, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, inflation is hurting both of us. While this isn't the ideal split, it's much better than my previous offer and a significant improvement over her offer in Round 5. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing the game carries increasing risk with diminishing returns as inflation keeps eroding the value."
