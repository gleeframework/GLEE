"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. I know that I'm at a disadvantage because the money is worth less each round, but I'm hoping to get a better deal for myself by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting the work I've done to get us here. Let's agree and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I've contributed more to this negotiation so far. Let's try to find a better compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a 60-40 split, the inflation is already eating away at my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get some money and avoids further losses."
