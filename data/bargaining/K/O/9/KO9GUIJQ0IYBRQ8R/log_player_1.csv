Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a bigger share considering the inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making it impossible to get a good deal. It's better to take the $1000 than risk getting nothing."
