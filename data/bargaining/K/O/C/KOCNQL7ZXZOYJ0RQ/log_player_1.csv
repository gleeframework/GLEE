"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Let's divide the money now and avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip this, I'll take the larger share this time.  This way we both get something, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather wait for a more favorable offer, considering that my share would be worth 10% less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer, considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%."
