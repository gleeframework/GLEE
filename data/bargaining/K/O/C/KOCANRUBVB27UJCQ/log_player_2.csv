Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, last chance 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both Bob and Alice.  Delaying further significantly eats into Bob's potential gain.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows time is on her side (her money is devaluing slower). Her offer is unlikely to improve significantly in a potential Round 4.
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting risks getting a much worse offer in a later round or even ending up with nothing if no agreement is reached. 

Bob might be hoping for a slightly better deal, but the risk associated with further delay outweighs the potential for a small increase in his share."
