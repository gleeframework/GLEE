Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than last time.  Let's reach an agreement before we both lose more money! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her share while taking advantage of my shrinking pot due to inflation. While the gap is closing, I still believe I can secure a slightly better deal in the next few rounds. It's a risk, but waiting too long will hurt me more than Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alright, let's stop wasting time. I'll meet you in the middle.  A 50/50 split is fair and we can both walk away with something.""}"
