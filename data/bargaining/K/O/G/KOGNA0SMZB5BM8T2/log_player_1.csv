"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's take the first step towards a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $7,200, and Bob's gain of $2,000 is now worth $1,900.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to calculate the adjusted amounts:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

After inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth $4,500, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth $4,750.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll accept this offer for now.
