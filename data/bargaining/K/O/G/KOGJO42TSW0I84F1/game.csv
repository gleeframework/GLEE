5463.0,4537.0,"Bob, time is literally money for me in this game.  While I think a 50/50 split is fair in principle, it doesn't account for the fact that my potential gains shrink with each round. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take a slightly smaller increase than my last offer, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.",Alice,3,

5250.0,4750.0,"Alice, I understand your position regarding the decreasing value. My previous offer of a 50/50 split was fair in principle, but I'm willing to compromise to end the game quickly. This offer is a middle ground between your first offer and a completely even split.",Bob,4,
