"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 500,000 is a decent amount, it's still a significant drop from my initial proposal.  I'm hoping that by rejecting, Bob will offer something closer to my original offer in the next round.  It's worth the risk to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a large share.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in avoiding another round of inflation, and accept this offer.  It's a good balance between maximizing my potential gains and avoiding further risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still not acceptable. I'm hoping he will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm going to reject again and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  It's a gamble, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the writing on the wall and accept this offer before the inflation eats away even more of our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, as the inflation is really biting now. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired share, and rejecting it risks another round of inflation, which could result in a much worse deal.  I'm going to accept and move on."
