"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease significantly for you in further rounds.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your offer was unfair to me. This is a more balanced proposal, considering the money loses value for me with each round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where you'll find my offer reasonable. The inflation is eating your potential gains. Accept this 55/45 split, and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
