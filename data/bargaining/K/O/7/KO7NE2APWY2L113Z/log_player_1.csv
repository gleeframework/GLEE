"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 4:1 split in my favor. This may seem unfair, but remember, the value of the money is decreasing for both of us with each round. It's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
