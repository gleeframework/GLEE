"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a good starting point, as it gives Alice a significant share while still leaving Bob with something.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take something, the current offer is too low for me considering the inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose Alice gets $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000.  This is a fairer split than Bob's last offer, and still gives him a decent amount.  Hopefully, he'll see reason this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While the inflation has hurt my gains significantly, it's better to take what I can get than risk losing even more in the next round."
