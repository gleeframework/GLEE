Let's start fair and even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to try to take advantage of the inflation and offer a deal that's more favorable to me. Since Bob's money is worth less, I'll offer him a slightly smaller share."

Round 4

Bob is getting very greedy, but I won't be swayed by his inflation-fueled demands. I'll still fight for a better deal!"

I'm taking a risk here, but I think I can get away with it. Bob's money is worth significantly less now, and he's already shown a willingness to accept a smaller share. I'm going to push for a larger cut while I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, but I think Bob is starting to get desperate. I'd rather take a smaller share than risk going into another round where his money is worth even less and he might just take everything."
