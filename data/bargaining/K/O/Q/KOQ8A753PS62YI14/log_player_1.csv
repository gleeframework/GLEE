"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a significant share (90%) while still offering Bob a reasonable amount. I want to see if he accepts this offer, as it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is significantly less than what I was offered in the previous round.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 85%, but still offering Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last proposal, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for. I'm hoping that with continued negotiation, I can secure a more favorable deal.  The inflation is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but only to 80%. I believe this is a fair offer that shows I'm willing to compromise while still securing a large portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers could result in a much smaller payout for him due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still significantly lower than what I've been aiming for. The inflation is a serious factor now, but I believe that I can still secure a better deal. I'm willing to risk it and see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm making a final effort to secure a good deal. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but it's still more advantageous for me in the long run.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation is now quite substantial. If he rejects, we're both at risk of getting very little in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is getting increasingly worrisome, but I'm still not willing to settle for this deal. I believe that I can get closer to an even split with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm willing to risk it and see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite now, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. This offer gives Bob a larger share than my previous offer, but it's still a significant portion for me. I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, he'll realize that it's in his best interest to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is very high now, and with only two rounds left, the potential gains are getting smaller. While this isn't the perfect split, it's a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances.  I'd rather take a secure share than risk getting nothing at all."
