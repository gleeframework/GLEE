"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split.  I want to keep the majority, but offer a small amount to Bob to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see if he's greedy or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is not good for me. While I am taking a loss due to inflation, a 400,000 / 600,000 split is still far too low for me.  I'm willing to wait another round and make a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly.  The inflation has impacted me, and Bob's previous rejection shows he's willing to play hardball.  I hope this offer is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call. I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob. Accepting this offer ensures I get *something* back, even if it's less than ideal. I'll take the 450,000 and hope to recoup some of the losses in future endeavors."
