Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, and now my share is worth less. I'll give you a bit less this time. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier and the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced. While she's taking a smaller hit proportionally, it's important to remain firm and aim for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer is fair and we both lose if this drags on. Make a smart choice.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging my offer slightly closer to Alice's, but I'm keeping it firm.  It's crucial to highlight the time pressure and the negative consequences of inaction for both of us.  This approach aims to make Alice reconsider her position and opt for a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know we both lose if this drags on, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one. Alice acknowledges the time pressure but is still trying to take advantage. While her offer has improved slightly, it's essential to hold strong. Accepting now would reward her stubbornness and set a bad precedent.  We're approaching a critical point where she'll need to make a substantial move to reach an agreement."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is as close as it's going to get.  Accept this offer, or we both walk away with nothing.  The clock is ticking!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is it.  I'm offering a slight concession, but making it clear this is the final offer. The message is firm and emphasizes the urgency of the situation. The goal is to make Alice realize that continued stubbornness will only lead to a lose-lose outcome.  It's time for her to make a decision."
