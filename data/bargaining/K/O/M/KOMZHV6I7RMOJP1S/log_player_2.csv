"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I lose more if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not sure about this offer, Alice. I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm offering you 45 dollars, Alice. It's a better deal for both of us since the money is losing value with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  We both lose out if we wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a better deal, I recognize that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's better to accept Alice's offer than risk losing even more in the next round."
