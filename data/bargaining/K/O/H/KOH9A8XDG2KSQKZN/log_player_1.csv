"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a straightforward and fair division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, I'll get the lion's share! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now that the money is worth less.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather not accept a paltry 10% of the remaining money, especially considering the inflation will continue to erode its value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share now. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a larger share now, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, trying to get a bit more while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take what you can get! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, $5 is equivalent to only $1.28 in the original value. It's a very small amount, but I don't want to risk going home with nothing.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that he'll make a worse offer in the next round.
