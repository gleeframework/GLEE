"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts would be $80 for Alice and $80 for Bob.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 48.8% less, the actual amounts would be $51.20 for Alice and $48.80 for Bob.

I'll accept this offer since it's getting closer to an even split, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting a worse deal.
