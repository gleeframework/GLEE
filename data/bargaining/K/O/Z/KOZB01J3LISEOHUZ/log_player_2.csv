Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```
Explanation: While Alice is showing some willingness to compromise, the deal is still not favorable enough considering the rapid inflation. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split.
