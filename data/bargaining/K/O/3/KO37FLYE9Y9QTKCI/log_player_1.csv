"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a better split, I realize that the inflation rate is working against me. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get at least some of the money."
