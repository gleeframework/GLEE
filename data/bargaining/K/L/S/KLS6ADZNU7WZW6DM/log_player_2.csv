"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good idea to start by seeing what kind of offers Alice is willing to make.  Even though 1000 dollars is something, I'm hoping to get a bigger share.  Let's see if I can get Alice to budge a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly even split. I want to see if Alice is willing to compromise.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice has clearly shown she is willing to negotiate and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation. While I'd prefer a more even split, 4000 is better than nothing, especially with the inflation."
