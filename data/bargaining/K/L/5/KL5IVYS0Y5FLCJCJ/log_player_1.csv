"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $30 is now worth less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since my share is worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45 is a fairer share for me""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which seems like a reasonable middle ground. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35-65 split, especially since my share is worth even less due to the increased inflation. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you more, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the effects of inflation. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
