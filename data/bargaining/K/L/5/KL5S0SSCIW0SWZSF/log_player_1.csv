Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win.  Let's see if Bob is greedy or wants to risk inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation means my gains are shrinking rapidly. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
