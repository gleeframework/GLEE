"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to keep most of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept. I figure, he might be willing to take a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than mine, and since the money is worth less with each passing round, it's better to take a guaranteed 50% now than to risk getting less in the future."
