"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a slightly more favorable deal for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, as I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, and this proposal is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not as generous as Bob's offer in Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, as I think it's too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground again, and this proposal is a bit more generous to me than Bob's offer in Round 4."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a very small share, but I think I should get the majority 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a very large share again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an 80/20 split, as I think it's extremely unfair and I deserve a much larger share. I'd like to try to get a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is the closest to fair""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I think I deserve the majority of the money 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is being quite stubborn. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 10/90 split, as it's extremely unfair and I deserve a much larger share. I'm starting to think that Bob is not interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a final proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, I'm not willing to go any lower""
}
```

I'm trying to make a strong final offer that gives me a significant share of the money, but still leaves some for Bob. I'm hoping that this will be a deal that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to accept anything less than 95, it's my final offer 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is being extremely aggressive and demanding. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 5/95 split, as it's completely unfair and I deserve a much larger share. I'm starting to think that Bob is not interested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement and is just trying to take advantage of me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I've had enough of Bob's aggressive offers. I'll make a final, last-ditch effort to try to get a fair deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it. I'm not negotiating further""
}
```

I'm trying to get a deal that's as close to fair as possible, but I'm not willing to give in to Bob's outrageous demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I want the majority of the money, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","That's it, I've had enough of Bob's ridiculous offers. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I refuse to accept a 2/98 split. This is an insult, and I'm not willing to be taken advantage of in such a blatant way. I'd rather walk away from the deal altogether than accept such an unfair offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It seems like Bob has made it clear that he's not interested in a fair deal. I'll make a final, last-ditch effort to try to salvage something:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,
  ""message"": ""I'm walking away from the deal. You've made it clear you're not interested in a fair split. I'll take nothing rather than accept such an unfair offer""
}
```

I'm essentially giving up on the deal and saying that I'd rather not take any money than accept a 0/100 split."
