"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 9000 dollars and leave Bob with 1000 dollars.  This seems like a fair first offer, given the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred more money, the inflation means that accepting this offer will give me more than if I reject and then propose a new division in the next round."
