I propose to take $9000, and leave $1000 for Bob. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it's a significant amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose we split the money evenly. This is the fairest solution, as it ensures we both get an equal share of the $10,000."
