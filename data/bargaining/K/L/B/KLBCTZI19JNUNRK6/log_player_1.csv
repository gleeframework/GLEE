"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to make a good impression and set the tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I think I can do better. I'd rather not give up half of the money just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one taking the risk of proposing. You can do better than this?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take 40%, you take 60%. It's a better deal for both of us than the last round, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll on Bob's offer, I think this 60/40 split is a decent compromise. It's a good opportunity to get a significant share of the money while still leaving some room for Bob to get a decent amount. I'll accept this offer.
