I'll offer Bob 50,000 and keep 950,000 for myself.  This gives me the majority, but it also gives Bob something to think about and avoids an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob 100,000 and keep 900,000 for myself.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll try to be more generous this time, but still aim to secure a significant portion of the money.  The inflation is starting to have a significant impact, so I need to try to maximize my gains before it erodes too much of my potential earnings."
