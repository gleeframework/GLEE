"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message to Bob to be fair and reasonable, hoping he'll see the offer as a good starting point and accept it. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer deal. Think carefully, the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, last chance before it's too late""
}
```

Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 1 would now be worth less, so I've adjusted it downwards. I'm still trying to find a middle ground, but I'm also emphasizing the urgency of the situation, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer before the money loses even more value."
