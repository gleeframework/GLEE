"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it.
