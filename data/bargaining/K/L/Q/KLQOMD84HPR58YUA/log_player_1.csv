Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation pressures on me, but your previous offer was too low. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. Let's settle before things get worse for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round, the value of the money significantly decreases for me (Alice). I need to reach a deal quickly.
* **Understanding Bob's Position:** Bob is also losing value, just not as rapidly. He likely anticipates I'll become more desperate and offer him a larger share as time goes on. 
* **Compromise, but with Firmness:** My offer is a compromiseâ€”it's less than my initial offer but still favors me. The message aims to show a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the urgency of the situation for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, I'm willing to go up to 57/43. This is as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The value of the money has dropped significantly for me (Alice). Waiting any longer is too risky as the potential gains will dwindle rapidly.
* **Bob's Position Hardening:** Bob knows I'm under time pressure. His message suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While 57/43 isn't ideal, accepting now cuts my losses and ensures I receive something substantial. Rejecting carries the risk of getting an even lower offer in later rounds, which, after inflation, might be worth less than what I can secure now."
