75.0,25.0,I propose we divide the $100 with a 75/25 split. This gives us both a reasonable share while accounting for the decreasing value of money over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 40% is a fair starting point. Let's see if you can do better than this.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I propose a 60/40 split. This maintains a balance between our shares while adjusting for the diminishing value of money.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 45% is a bit too low. I'll give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",Bob,4,
