Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than before, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering slightly more, the inflation is eating significantly into Bob's potential gains. It's still beneficial to hold out and aim for a more even split, or at least something closer to 45/55 in Bob's favor to offset the inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is shrinking. I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be close to our last offers.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going much lower 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While not ideal, accepting 44 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later when the value diminishes further, or even getting nothing if the rounds run out.  It's a gamble, but the risk of getting a much worse outcome is outweighing the potential for a slightly better deal at this stage."
