"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal than accept 40% of the money. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll try to be a bit more generous than Alice was, but still aim for a relatively even split. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice in this round, I'll take that into account in my offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting us both, Bob, but my position is still strong. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, but considering the devaluation of the money, I think we can find a more balanced split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation on both of us, I'll adjust my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money. Since Alice is more affected by inflation, I'll try to find a balance that might be more appealing to her, while still aiming for a relatively fair split.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the rising inflation, let's adjust our expectations and meet in the middle.""}"
