"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable division""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 6,000 and Bob will take 4,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable division, considering we're starting with a large sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, as I think I can do better. I was hoping to get a better deal, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I'll take 5,500 and Bob will take 4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not budging 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 45-55 split, especially since the value of my potential gain has decreased significantly due to inflation. I was hoping to get a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll reject it and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not giving up yet. This is my final offer""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, where I'll take 5,200 and Bob will take 4,800. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm not willing to give up much more. This is my final offer."
