I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly. I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer. I'm willing to be more generous if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this offer increasingly attractive. I'm not sure how much Bob is aware of the inflation, but getting $5,000 (which is worth $4,500 due to inflation) is better than risking a smaller share in the next round."
