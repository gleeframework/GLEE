I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  Since we have a limited number of rounds, I believe it's important to get a sizable chunk of the money right away.  I'm willing to negotiate later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation affecting both of us, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money.  It's important to make progress towards a deal, as the value of our potential winnings continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm further reducing my share to compensate for the increasing inflation.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm willing to compromise to secure an agreement before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

While this offer is slightly better than the previous one, it's still significantly less than what I believe I deserve, and the value of the money continues to depreciate rapidly. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm reducing my share further, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  We're getting dangerously close to the end of the rounds, and the value of our winnings is plummeting. I believe this offer is reasonable given the circumstances and provides us with a significant amount of money."
