"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that gives me a slightly larger share. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
