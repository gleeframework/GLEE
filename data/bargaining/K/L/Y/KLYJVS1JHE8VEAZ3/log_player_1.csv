"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for most of the money. I'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty good, but I'm hoping for a better deal.  I'll reject and see if he'll budge further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer a bit, but still keeping a decent amount for myself.  Let's see if this is enough to tempt Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, and Bob seems to be standing his ground.  I'll accept this offer, as it's still a decent amount and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
