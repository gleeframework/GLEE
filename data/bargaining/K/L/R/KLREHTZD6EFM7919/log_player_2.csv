"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly, and we can both get a good chunk of the money before the value drops too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  I'm willing to adjust slightly but I need you to meet me closer to my initial offer for this to work. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, the money is losing value quickly, and Alice is willing to compromise. It's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
