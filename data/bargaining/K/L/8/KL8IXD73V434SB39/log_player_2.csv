Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting offer, but I can definitely do better. I'll wait to see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm starting with a more even split. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see we're both willing to negotiate. I'm willing to move closer to a 60/40 split.  Let's see if we can close the deal this round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my desired split, and the inflation is starting to bite. I'll take the offer."
