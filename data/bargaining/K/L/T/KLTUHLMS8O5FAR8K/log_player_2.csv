"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'll try to propose something in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, I'll still get a decent share, and we can move forward. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I think it's wiser to accept this offer. The inflation is starting to take a toll, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
