"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the upcoming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, I'm getting a smaller share than I was in my initial offer. However, I do think that the 10% decrease in value of my gains due to inflation is a significant factor.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's proposal didn't work out, I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a 55-45 split, considering the inflation factor""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable and take into account the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle - a 55/45 split is fair, considering inflation and our previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of the money, but I'm willing to consider Bob's proposal.

Since Bob is proposing a 55-45 split, I'm getting a smaller share than I was in my initial offer. However, I do think that the 55/45 split is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation factor.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
