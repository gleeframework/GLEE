Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Compromise on a 55-45 split, considering the inflation factor

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject again.  While the offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not what I consider fair. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
