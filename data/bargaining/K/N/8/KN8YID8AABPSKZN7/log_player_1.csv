# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's important we reach an agreement soon, as the value decreases with each round. This offer is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's perception of value is decreasing rapidly. While $550,000 seems like a lot to him now, next round it'll be worth significantly less.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance I could secure a slightly better deal in Round 5. However, there's also a chance Bob's offer will become even less favorable due to his skewed perception of value.
* **Finality:** Bob stated this is his final offer. This adds weight to the idea that waiting longer might not yield a better outcome.

Accepting $450,000 now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting it risks a worse offer or a stalemate where we both lose out."
