"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split for both of us. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's actually offering me 5000 dollars that are worth 80% of the original amount, which is 4000 dollars. And he's offering himself 5000 dollars that are worth 80% of the original amount, which is 4000 dollars.

I accept this offer.
