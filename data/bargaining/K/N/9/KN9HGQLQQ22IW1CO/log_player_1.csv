"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer. In this case, my gain of $4000 is equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and wait for a better deal. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from round 1 was already quite generous. This time, I'll try to be more aggressive. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

This way, I'll get 70% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth $3000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $4138.19 in the first round's value.

This offer is actually a bit better than my original offer in round 1, considering the inflation. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
