Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but my offer in this round is actually better for you than your previous offer if we factor in inflation. Let's be pragmatic. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze why:

* **Bob's offer is worse for Alice after inflation:** Bob claims his offer is better for Alice than her previous offer after inflation. This is false. After inflation, Alice's previous offer would have been worth 700,000 * 0.9 = $630,000. Bob's current offer of $600,000 is less than that.
* **Time is on Alice's side:**  The inflation rate hurts Bob more than Alice. With each round, his share is worth significantly less. This gives Alice leverage to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing pressure:** While still aiming for a favorable outcome for Alice, we slightly increase the pressure on Bob. The decreasing value of the money due to the higher inflation rate on his end should incentivize him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Maintaining a reasonable approach:** Even though the offer is slightly less than what Alice could have gained in the previous round (600,000 after inflation), it's still a significantly larger portion than what Bob is getting.  This offer aims to balance firmness with fairness to increase the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we both risk ending up with much less. Time is literally money for us right now. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is feeling the pressure:** Bob's message indicates he's feeling the heat from the inflation. This means Alice's strategy of remaining firm is working.
* **Still not a good deal for Alice:** Even factoring in the 27.1% inflation, Alice's offer from round 3 would be worth approximately 472,500. Bob's current offer of 550,000 might seem tempting, but it's still less than what Alice could have potentially secured in the previous round had Bob been more receptive. 
* **One more push:** Bob is likely getting desperate.  Alice can afford to hold out for one more round and propose an offer slightly better than Bob's current one, which will still be significantly in Alice's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and firmness:** This offer presents a sense of finality to push Bob towards acceptance. The message emphasizes that this is Alice's last offer. 
* **Strategic concession:**  While the offer is slightly better than Bob's last offer, it's still less than what Alice aimed for initially. This slight concession might be the key to getting Bob to agree before the value of his potential share diminishes further.
* **Leveraging time pressure:** By highlighting the shrinking value of the money, Alice reiterates that time is working against Bob more than her. This reinforces the urgency for him to accept this offer."
