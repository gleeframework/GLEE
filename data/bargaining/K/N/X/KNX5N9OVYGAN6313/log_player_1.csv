"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have an equal chance of winning. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55/45 is a bit too skewed towards him. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 55/45. How about 50/50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation has taken its toll, and my $45 is now worth even less. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. Hope you'll consider it.""
}
```"
