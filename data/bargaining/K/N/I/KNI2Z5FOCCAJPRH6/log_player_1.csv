"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's heavily skewed in his favor, and I'm not getting a fair deal considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last time, now it's my turn to be tough!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, taking into account the 5% reduction in value due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being tough, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because it's still not a 50/50 split, and I'm not getting a fair deal considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being tough enough, time to get real!""
