"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive start, let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as I think I can do better than a 75-25 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try for a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to find a more balanced compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll try to negotiate a bit more:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a slightly more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation continues to erode the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value, I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet at 50-50, a fair split in these tough times!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a balance in these challenging economic conditions."
