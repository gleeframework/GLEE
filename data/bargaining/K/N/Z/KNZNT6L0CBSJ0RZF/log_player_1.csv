"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine from Round 1, but he's trying to spin it as a new offer. I'm not impressed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a new offer that's actually different from the previous one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time. But I'm not getting any younger, so I need a decent share.""
}
```"
