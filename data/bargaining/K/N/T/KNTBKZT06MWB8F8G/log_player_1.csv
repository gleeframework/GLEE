"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, the actual amount I'll receive is 300,000 * 0.95 = 285,000.
The amount Bob gains is worth 10% less, so the actual amount he'll receive is 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I'll receive is 450,000 * 0.857 (1 - 0.1426) = 385,715.
The money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amount he'll receive is 550,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.271) = 399,135.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
