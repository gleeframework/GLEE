# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a risky move, but  rejecting gives me the chance to make a better proposal.  I need to see how this game plays out with the inflation factor."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. This is a 60/40 split, which is better than what you offered.  I'm hoping we can both walk away with a decent share.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. Don't expect me to go easy on you. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While I'm losing value with each round, I need to stand my ground and try to negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see what she comes up with next."

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't be swayed.  I'm still losing a significant amount of value, but I need to hold out for a better deal.  It's a gamble, but I believe we can find a more equitable solution."
