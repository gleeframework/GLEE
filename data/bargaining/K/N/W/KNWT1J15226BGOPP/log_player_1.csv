"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, my gain of $50 is actually worth $40 in the first round's value. But since we're considering the current round's value, I'll consider the $50 as my gain.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is worth 20% less than $50, which is $40.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to meet in the middle, but I'll give you more than that. Take it or leave it.""
}"
