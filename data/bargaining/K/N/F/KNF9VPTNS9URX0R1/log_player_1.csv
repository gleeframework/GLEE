"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the new values, I'll have to be careful. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is 30% of the original $1,000,000. That's a bit less than I was hoping for.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share, but not too greedy. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. This should be a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still want the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger toll, and my share is getting smaller and smaller!

Considering the new values, I'll have to be careful. If I accept this offer, I'll get $200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial hopes.

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think about it for a moment...
