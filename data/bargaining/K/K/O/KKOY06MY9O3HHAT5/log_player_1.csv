"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to get him to accept and let me make the next proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is worth 5% less than the $8,000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $7,200 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm getting a smaller share than I initially proposed, but I'm also getting a larger share than I would have gotten in the first round.

However, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so my gain will be worth even less than $7,200.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it evenly. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so my gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $6,313.40 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Splitting it evenly seems fair, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I also don't want to risk going into the next round and potentially getting a worse deal.

Considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting close to the 12th round, I think I should take the safe bet.
