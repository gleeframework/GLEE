"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, so we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effects of inflation.

Since my gain is worth 5% less, I'll get $60 * 0.95 = $57. My gain is $57.
Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he'll get $40 * 0.8 = $32.

I'll accept this offer.
