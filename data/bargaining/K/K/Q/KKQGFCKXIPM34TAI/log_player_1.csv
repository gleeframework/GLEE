Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can agree on a more balanced split this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like the fairest option now. Let's end this before we lose more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, accepting this offer will give me $36.45, and Bob will also get $36.45.\n\nIf I reject and we go to the next round, the money will be worth even less, and I risk getting an even lower amount. Meeting in the middle at this point seems like the best option to minimize losses from inflation."
