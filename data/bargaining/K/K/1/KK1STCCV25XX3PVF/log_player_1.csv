Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I won't back down, Alice. This is still a fair offer considering the inflation. You're not the only one who can make a 'final' offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the value of his potential gains decreases. While his offer isn't terrible, I'm betting he'll crack and offer me a much larger share in the next round to avoid losing even more to inflation."
