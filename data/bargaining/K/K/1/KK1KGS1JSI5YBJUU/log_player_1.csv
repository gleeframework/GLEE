Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. Consider the devaluation - dragging this out only hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
