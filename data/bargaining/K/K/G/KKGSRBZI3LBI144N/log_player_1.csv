Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio, where I receive $7500 and you receive $2500. This way, we can share the funds fairly while considering the potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share now to leave room for future negotiations, hoping to get a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
