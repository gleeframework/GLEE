"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, with a message suggesting that this is a fair and almost equal split. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be a bit more generous. I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's be reasonable. This is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's just split it down the middle, we're both losing value""
}
```

I've decided to offer a 50/50 split, considering the inflation is affecting both of us and the value of the money is decreasing. Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in this and accept."
