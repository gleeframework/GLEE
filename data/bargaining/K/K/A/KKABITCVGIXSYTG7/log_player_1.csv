"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total. Accept and we can end the game!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob will get 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you an even split, but you have to accept it now! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $8,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $5,000, which is worth 50% of the original $10,000, which is a fair split.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
