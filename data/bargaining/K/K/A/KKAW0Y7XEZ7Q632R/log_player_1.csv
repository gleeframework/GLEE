"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly.  I figure he'll be happy with even a small amount, and it's better than risking the money losing value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's less than my original proposal, the risk of losing more money with each round is too high.  It's better to take a fair split now."
