"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, but I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
