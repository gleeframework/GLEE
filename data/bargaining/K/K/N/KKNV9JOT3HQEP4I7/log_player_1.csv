"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me a bit too little, I'll take 60, but I'll be generous and let you have 40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. With the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share this round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'll take 62.5, I think that's a fair share considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 37.5 
# Bob gain: 62.5 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving Bob a 62.5% share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 37.5% share, even though I think it's a bit low. Better than risking even less value in the next round!"
