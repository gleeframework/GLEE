I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience.""

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share if you're not willing to give me more.""

  ""bob_gain"": 150000,

```

I'm proposing a very uneven split, with me taking 85% of the money and Bob taking just 15%. This is my most aggressive offer yet, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."

I'm proposing a 99.9-0.1 split, which is a very one-sided offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm not sure he will."
