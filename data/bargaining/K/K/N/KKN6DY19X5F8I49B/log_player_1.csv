"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and split it 50/50, considering the value of money will decrease for both of us in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
