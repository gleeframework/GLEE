I'm going for a bold strategy.  I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 50$ than to risk getting nothing. It's a fair deal, and I'm not sure I can do better."
