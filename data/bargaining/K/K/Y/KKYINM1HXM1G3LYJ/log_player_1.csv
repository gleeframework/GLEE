I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This seems fair since the money will devalue more for him than for me in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I am taking a smaller share this round because I am confident I can secure a better deal in the future. The inflation will hurt Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}

I'm continuing to reduce my share, aiming to entice Bob with a more substantial offer as the rounds progress. While the devaluation is impacting me less severely, it's critical to find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

This is still a poor deal for me, and I'm confident that we can negotiate a more equitable split in the remaining rounds.  The inflation is impacting Bob significantly, and I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share if it means we can come to an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}

I'm continuing to lower my share, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation is hitting him much harder, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is much closer to what I'd want, it's still not equitable given the significant impact of inflation on Bob. I believe we can still reach a more balanced agreement in the remaining rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

With the inflation hitting Bob hard, I'm reducing my share further. I'm hoping this will create enough incentive for him to consider an agreement."
