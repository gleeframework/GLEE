"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, let's start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55-45, it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. With the money being worth 5% less, I need to consider the value of the amount I'll be getting. 

I'll decide to reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 480,000$ and keeping 520,000$ for myself. The message is a gentle nudge, suggesting a compromise that's closer to my desired split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious.

However, a 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll decide to accept this offer.
