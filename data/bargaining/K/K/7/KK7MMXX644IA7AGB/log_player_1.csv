"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my revised offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This time, I'm proposing a slightly skewed split in my favor, given the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more skewed towards his favor, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth significantly less for me, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll accept this offer to get something rather than risking getting nothing.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
