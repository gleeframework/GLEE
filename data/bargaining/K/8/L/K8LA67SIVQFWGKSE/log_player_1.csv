"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, since the money is worth slightly less for you.  This ensures we both get a fair share, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
