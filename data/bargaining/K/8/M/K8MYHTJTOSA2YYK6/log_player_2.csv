"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This gives us a good split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While it seems like a lot of money now, the inflation will hurt Alice more than me in the long run. I think I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn.  I believe in fairness too, so I'm offering you the same deal, but with us reversed.  It's a good offer, especially considering the inflation working against you.  Take it while you can.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's not how this works.  I'm losing money every round, remember?  This offer is still generous, but I need to factor in the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is right, she's losing money each round, but this offer is still not good enough. It seems like she's trying to anchor the negotiations around her being the one who gets the bigger share. I need to hold out for a better deal and highlight the impact inflation has on her gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts you in a tough spot, but so does your previous offer for me. This offer reflects the changing value of the money. It's time to be realistic.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get considering the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, and her message shows it. While she's losing money rapidly, this offer is still tilted in her favor. We're past the halfway point, and she'll be feeling the pressure even more soon. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and every round hurts you more than it hurts me. This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now.  Any more stalling and we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally panicking. It's unlikely she'll offer a better split than this given the rapid inflation working against her. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather take it now than risk getting nothing in the end."
