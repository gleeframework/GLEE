"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $4000 in this round is equivalent to $3800 in the previous round. I think this is a good opportunity to get a higher share of the money, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable share to Bob, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really adding up! My gain of $3000 in this round is equivalent to $4299.22 in the first round. Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
