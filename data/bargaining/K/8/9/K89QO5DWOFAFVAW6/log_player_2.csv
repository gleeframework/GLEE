Let's see if Alice takes this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still very one-sided, and I'm hoping to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
