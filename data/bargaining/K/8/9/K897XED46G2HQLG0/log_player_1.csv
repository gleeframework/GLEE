"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, and leave 40% for Bob. This is a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 400,000 / 0.8 = 500,000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000 (due to 20% inflation)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to do better next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

My offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the original $1,000,000, leaving 45% for Bob. This should be a more attractive offer, considering the inflation."
