# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While the offer is getting worse, accepting now would still net me something. However, I'm betting Alice will start panicking in the later rounds and offer a larger share to avoid getting nothing."

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on now. Alice is sticking to her guns, and the value of the deal for me is diminishing rapidly.  It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in the final rounds."
