"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know this is a limited-time offer, so think carefully. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with 40 dollars, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Hopefully, Alice will be more generous or willing to compromise.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, while still considering Alice's desire for a fair split. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, Alice. We both get a decent share, and we can walk away happy.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm eager to see her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm feeling generous, but my patience is wearing thin. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer since I previously offered Alice a 45-55 split in my favor, and she rejected it. Given that the money is worth the same to me but significantly less to Alice, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less to Alice due to inflation. Since she's feeling the pressure of time, I'll make an offer that's slightly more aggressive in my favor.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, the longer we wait, the less the money is worth to you. I'm willing to walk away with a bigger share. It's time to make a decision.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll accept, given the decreasing value of the money to her."
