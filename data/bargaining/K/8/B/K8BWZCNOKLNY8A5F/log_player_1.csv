"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90/10. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept or reject the offer."
