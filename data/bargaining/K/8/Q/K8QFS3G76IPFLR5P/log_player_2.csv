"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth risking a round to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. It's possible she'll offer a better deal in the next round, especially if she doesn't understand the inflation mechanic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's flip the script from last round - I'll take 600,000 and you take 400,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
