Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  I'm not sure why you're pushing for more, but I'm willing to compromise for a clean split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the split is even, the inflation rate has already reduced the value of the money, and I think I can still negotiate for a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the inflation rate and the fact that Alice is willing to compromise. Here's my proposal:
