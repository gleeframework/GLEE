"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This offer aims to be fair while giving me a slight advantage. It's not a huge split, leaving room for negotiation if Bob is feeling generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split and taking it ensures I get something.  The diminishing value of the money with each round makes accepting this offer the best option."
