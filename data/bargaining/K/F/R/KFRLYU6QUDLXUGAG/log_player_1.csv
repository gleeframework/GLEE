"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly and we can end the game before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is worth even less now due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but don't think I'm being generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than the middle ground, but I'm still trying to get the better end of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, but I'll take it 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not getting the better end of the deal, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation."
