"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease for me in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I can still get $450,000, which is a decent amount. However, considering the money will be worth 20% less for Bob in the next round, I think he's right that a 55-45 split is a good idea. I'll accept his offer.
