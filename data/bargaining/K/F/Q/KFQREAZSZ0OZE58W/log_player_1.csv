Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely hesitant to accept this offer, as it's a very lopsided split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I don't think 20/80 is a fair or acceptable split. I'll try to make one last offer to try to get a better deal."

# Bob's message: Alice, we're in the final stretch.  I'm going for a 90/10 split.  It's a risky move, but I believe it's the best chance we have of getting something.  Let's make a deal before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated with Bob's offer. A 90/10 split is completely unacceptable, and I'm not willing to accept it. I've compromised and tried to find a fair split throughout the game, but Bob's demands have become unreasonable. I'm willing to accept a small share rather than accept such an unfair split."
