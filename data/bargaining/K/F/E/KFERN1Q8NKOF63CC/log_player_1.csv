"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively low amount, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to go! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer! I'd rather not take the lower amount I proposed earlier, so I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
