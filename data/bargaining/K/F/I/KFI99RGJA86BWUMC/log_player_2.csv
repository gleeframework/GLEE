"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both have an equal chance of benefiting. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject the offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation will heavily favor Alice in the long run. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair that we both get a larger share of the money while it's still worth a lot. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting 60%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's adjust our shares accordingly. How about splitting it 54/46? 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me, and accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
