I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next!"

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a more even split. Since Alice rejected my offer in round 1, I think she might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even with the inflation, it's a better deal than what I offered in round 2.  It's also close to a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable outcome.  I'm not sure how much more I can realistically expect to gain."
