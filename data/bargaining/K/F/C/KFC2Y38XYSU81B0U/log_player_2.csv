"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this offer and we can split the money quickly! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems like a good deal now, the inflation will make it much less favorable in later rounds. By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to make a more equitable proposal to avoid the risk of losing more money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split.  This is a fair starting point and will ensure we both get a decent share. Let's work together to make sure we both get something.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more due to the initial proposal. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her initial proposal, it's still not a good deal for Bob considering the inflation.  The next round, Bob will be able to make another offer and try to improve the split further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering a 60/40 split. This takes into account the inflation and offers a better deal for both of us than the previous rounds.  It's time to be reasonable and avoid losing more money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced that I should get less than 60% of the remaining money. This is my next best offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob is losing more money due to inflation, Alice's offer is better than any previous offer.  At this point, Bob should accept the offer to ensure he gets at least a portion of the money.  Continuing to reject offers carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing if Alice rejects Bob's offer in the next round."
