"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this.  A reasonable offer for you to consider. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can find a more equitable division. Let's see what the next round brings, considering the impact of inflation."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground that suits us both.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation, but your offer was too low. Let's settle this quickly with a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nGiven the current offer and the impact of inflation, I still believe we can negotiate a better split. The decrease in value due to inflation makes it crucial to maximize my gain. Let's proceed to the next round to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
