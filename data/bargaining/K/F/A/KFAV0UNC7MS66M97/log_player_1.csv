I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've lowered my offer slightly to account for the increasing inflation and the risk of Bob rejecting it again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While my share is much smaller than what I initially aimed for, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and there's a high chance that rejecting this offer will lead to an even lower share in the next round. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
