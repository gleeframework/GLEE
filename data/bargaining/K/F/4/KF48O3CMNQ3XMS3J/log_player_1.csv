"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, hoping to find a middle ground."
