# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more substantial compromise from Bob, considering the initial 50/50 proposal. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer, but still trying to maintain a decent balance between our gains."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation factor and the compromise we've made so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

After considering the inflation factor and the previous offers, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. The compromise is getting closer to a fair split, and I'm willing to accept this offer to conclude the game."
