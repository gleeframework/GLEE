"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 60-40 split might seem fair at first, it's important to consider the inflation factor. In the next round, my share will be worth less than 400,000, while Alice's share will be worth less than 600,000. I'm better off rejecting and seeing if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money closer to 55-45.  This way, we both get a better share before inflation kicks in too much."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is as low as I can go for now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation.  Accepting 420,000 is better than waiting and getting even less in the next round."
