I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share while still securing the majority for me.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is significant. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the remaining value, and avoids the risk of getting even less in the next round."
