Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the pinch of inflation already. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This offer is my final compromise.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  You're right, I need to be realistic, but I also need a reasonable share to make this worthwhile given the inflation. This is a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's strategically better to accept. Here's why:

* **Alice is getting serious:** Her message indicates this is her final offer, and her willingness to compromise suggests she understands the urgency. 
* **Time is running out:**  With each round, the potential gains for both of you decrease, especially for Alice. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing. 
* **Decent offer considering inflation:** While not ideal, getting $300,000 is a good outcome given the circumstances. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout in the face of increasing uncertainty."
