"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a decent amount still! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 400,000 is a decent amount, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is keeping 600,000. I'd like to see a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

300,000 is still a significant amount less than what I was hoping for, especially considering the inflation has reduced its value even further. I'd like to see a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth only 72.9% of its original value now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to squeeze out a bit more!""
}
```

I'm aiming to get as much as I can, given the inflation and the fact that Bob has been unwilling to budge so far!"
