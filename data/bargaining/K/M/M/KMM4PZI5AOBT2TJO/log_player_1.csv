"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% if you give me 60% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, but I might be willing to consider it.

I'll accept this offer for now.
