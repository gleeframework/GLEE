"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, 50% for me and 50% for Bob."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can consider it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the offer carefully.

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly more generous offer, but I still want a decent share""
}
