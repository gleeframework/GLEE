Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think my share should be higher. Inflation is hurting me more. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but she's still trying to take a significantly larger share.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation hurts me. However, accepting a deal where I get less than half is not in my best interest, especially since we still have several rounds left.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a severely imbalanced outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and agree on a fair 50/50 split. It's clear we both want a larger share, but the longer this drags on, the more we both lose to inflation. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Moving to a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the inflation impact is becoming increasingly significant.  
* **Signaling Fairness:** A 50/50 split demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution. It removes the pressure of negotiation and presents a clean, understandable deal.
* **Preventing Losses:**  Continuing to haggle over a few percentage points risks ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time.

This offer gives us the best chance to secure a reasonable amount of money before inflation erodes its value further."
