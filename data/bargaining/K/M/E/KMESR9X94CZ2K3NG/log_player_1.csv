Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000 dollars, and give Bob 1000 dollars.  I'm hoping this is a fair starting point.  I'll accept any offer where I get at least 4000 dollars, but would prefer more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'll accept the offer.  It's not ideal, but I'm happy to split the money evenly."
