"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, you take the 10. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There are still 11 rounds left, and the value of the money will decrease for me if I don't take a chance."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, Alice.  Let's both get a good share of the money before inflation eats into it too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's do 70/30 this round, and hopefully we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd still prefer a bigger share, the inflation is becoming a real risk. Accepting 30% now is better than risking getting nothing if we keep going."
