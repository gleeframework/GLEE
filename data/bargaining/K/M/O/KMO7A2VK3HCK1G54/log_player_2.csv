**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The inflation is hurting, but I'm betting she'll crack before I do.  There's still a long way to go and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, be smart 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, but I'm not giving in yet. Alice is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which means my strategy of standing firm is working. The inflation hurts, but getting a slightly larger share is more important than accepting a bad deal out of fear."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alright Alice, let's end this. 50/50. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're at a critical point. The inflation is eating into the potential gains, and Alice is clearly aiming for a 50/50 split. Offering her exactly that eliminates her negotiating power and forces her hand. If she rejects this, it demonstrates she's not acting rationally and further negotiation is pointless."
