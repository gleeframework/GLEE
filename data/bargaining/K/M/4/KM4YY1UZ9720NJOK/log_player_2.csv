Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial potential gain due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to leverage the time constraint against Bob. It's a risky move, but holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two might be worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out. Let's be fair and split it evenly.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is steadily eroding Bob's potential gains.  While he's held out for a better deal, the risk of getting nothing is increasing. A 50/50 split is the fairest option and has a high chance of acceptance, preventing a total loss at the end.  This offer signals a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your even split was a good try, but I want more 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While not ideal, accepting this offer gives Bob something rather than nothing. Rejecting it carries a very real risk of Alice pushing for even less in subsequent rounds, and Bob's potential gains will further dwindle due to inflation. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk ending up with nothing."
