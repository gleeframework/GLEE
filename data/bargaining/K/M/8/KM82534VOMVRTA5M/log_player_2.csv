"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it seems tempting to take $1000 now, I stand to gain much more if we can agree on a fairer split later.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's better than you'll get in later rounds when the value drops for me."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's split it 70/30, and we can both get something. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me with the decreasing value, but 30% is still too low. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be reasonable. I'll come down to 55/45.  This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the decreasing value. Take it or leave it."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  Let's split this 60/40, with me taking the larger share. It's a better deal for both of us than waiting for further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It pains me to accept anything less than 50%, but Alice is right, time is running out.  Accepting 40% now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we can't agree in the next few rounds."
