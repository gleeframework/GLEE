"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI propose we divide the money with me receiving $5500 and Bob receiving $4500. I've included a message to Bob suggesting a fair split. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. I'm willing to give you a little more to get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The inflation means I'm already losing value, and I think I can get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll propose a new offer where I receive $5250 and Bob receives $4750.
