"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. It's a very uneven split, and there are 12 rounds, meaning I have time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable division, and I believe it's in our best interest to come to an agreement quickly."
