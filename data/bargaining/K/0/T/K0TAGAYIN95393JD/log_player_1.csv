"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the money, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 450000

Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the total amount is now $950,000.
