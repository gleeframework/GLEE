{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100 dollars, which is 60 dollars, and Bob gets the remaining 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about whether 20 dollars is enough for me.
