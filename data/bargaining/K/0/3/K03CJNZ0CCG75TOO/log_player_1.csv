"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, let's try a more balanced approach this time. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts I'd receive are:

* My gain: 20 * 0.9 = 18
* Bob's gain: 80 * 0.9 = 72

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not as thrilled about this offer. I'll reject it.

* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.7273 = 43.638 (approximately)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I'd be getting less than I proposed in round 3, and the value of my share is reduced even further due to inflation. I'll reject it.
