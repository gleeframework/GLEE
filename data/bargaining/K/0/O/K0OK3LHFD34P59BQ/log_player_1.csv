"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can start fresh with a good split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount and can start fresh with a good split. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my initial offer in Round 1 was actually equivalent to $7,200 in Round 2's value, and Bob's offer is equivalent to $3,000 in Round 2's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, my offer in Round 2 would have been equivalent to $6,900 in Round 3's value, and Bob's offer would have been equivalent to $3,000 in Round 3's value.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,500 and keeping $6,500 for myself, trying to find a middle ground. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fair split, I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

The original $10,000 is worth 0.85 (1 - 0.15) = 85% of its original value after 3 rounds of inflation, and then another 0.8626 (1 - 0.1374) = 86.26% of that value after Round 4's inflation, so the actual value of the money in Round 4 is 0.85 * 0.8626 = 0.7327 or 73.27% of the original value.

The original $10,000 is worth $7,327 in Round 4's value.

Bob's offer is equivalent to $4,315 in Round 4's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can finalize the deal."
