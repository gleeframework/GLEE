"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain of 80 in the first round is now equivalent to 76.4. Bob's offer of 70 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept this offer.
