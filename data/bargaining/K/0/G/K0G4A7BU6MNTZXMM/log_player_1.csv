Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be realistic. This offer is better for me, but you should consider the decreasing value. Time is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is fair and time is running out. It's better to secure a deal now than risk getting nothing later.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm being reasonable. This offer is still decent for you considering the inflation. We need to settle this soon. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is correct that the offer is still decent considering the inflation. However, he's clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better deal, hoping he'll become more agreeable as we approach the deadline."
