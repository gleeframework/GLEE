"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the smaller share for now""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 2:3, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation rate. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I'll be getting 6000, which is worth 80% of 8000 (the amount I would have gotten in the first round), I'll have to consider whether it's a good deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal if you wait""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly! I need to be careful with my decisions now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think about the current value of the money. Since I'll be getting 5500, which is worth 55% of 8000 (the amount I would have gotten in the first round), I'll have to decide whether it's a good deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.
