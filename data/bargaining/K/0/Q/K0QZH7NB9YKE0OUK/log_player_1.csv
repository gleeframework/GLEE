"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, taking the lion's share.  I want to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 40% share, which is closer to his previous proposal, but still gives me a significant portion of the remaining money. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer isn't ideal, I've already lost a significant amount of money due to inflation. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure at least some of the money."
