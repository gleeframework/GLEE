"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This gives us both a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that's not fair considering the inflation working against me. How about this counter-offer?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. This is better than my last offer for you considering inflation, and we both lose if this fails. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate.  While this offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to push for a more equitable split, knowing the pressure is on as we approach the later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. It acknowledges your desire for a larger share, but also factors in the faster rate of inflation impacting me. We need to settle this soon.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm lowering my demand again, but we're both losing out the longer this drags on.  Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me, but her offer is still not addressing the core issue: the unequal impact of inflation. I need to stand my ground, even though the shrinking pot makes it tempting to accept.  A 50/50 split is looking less likely, but I have to aim for a deal that reflects the reality of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm compromising again. This offer is less than my last, but more importantly, it recognizes that our positions are becoming more equal as the rounds progress. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point. The pressure is mounting, and waiting any longer significantly hurts both of us.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** The rapidly increasing inflation for Alice means the longer this goes on, the less appealing her desired split becomes.  
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By making a small concession, I show willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the need for a fair deal that reflects the changing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's time to be fair.  A 50/50 split is the only logical solution at this point.  Let's not throw away any more money! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come around to a reasonable proposal.  While I would have preferred a slightly higher percentage earlier, accepting a 50/50 split now is the best way to ensure we both walk away with a significant sum.  The increasing inflation rates mean that holding out for a better deal is getting riskier with each passing round."
