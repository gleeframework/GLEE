"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40% of the money, which is $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the new values, I see that Bob's offer is:

* My gain: $300,000 (worth 20% less than the original $400,000)
* Bob's gain: $700,000 (worth 10% less than the original $800,000)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'm willing to accept it. After all, Bob is trying to compromise.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
