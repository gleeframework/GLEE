"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm offering Bob, but still keeping a slight majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the current value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
