"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you 30, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me a decent chunk of the money, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair offer. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the initial $100, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with 40. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to give me a better deal, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 55, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my gain being worth 27.1% less than the initial $100, I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair deal, especially since we're meeting in the middle. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 50 it is. I think we've reached a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm hoping this is the final round, and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money!"
