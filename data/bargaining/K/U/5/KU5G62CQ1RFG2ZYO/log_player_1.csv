"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my first offer. I'm starting with a significant share for myself, but leaving a small amount for Bob. It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping to secure a good amount for myself early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
