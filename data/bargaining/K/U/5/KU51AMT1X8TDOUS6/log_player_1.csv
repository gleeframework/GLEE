Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, as it's still a significant gain for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, $4000 is still a significant gain, and it's likely Bob won't be willing to offer me more in the next round."
