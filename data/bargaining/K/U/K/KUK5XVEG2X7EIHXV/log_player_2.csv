Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can still find a more balanced split. Let's try a 55/45 split this time, with me taking slightly more to account for inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. Let's split it 52/48 this time. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm also factoring in the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is finally moving closer to a more reasonable split, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than in Round 4 due to inflation. It's getting risky, but I need to push for a slightly better deal while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm agreeing to an even split. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating into my potential gains with each passing round. While I want a better deal, it's becoming too risky. Offering a 50/50 split now is a firm offer signaling I'm serious about reaching a deal, but won't accept anything less.  This avoids further rounds and minimizes the impact of inflation."
