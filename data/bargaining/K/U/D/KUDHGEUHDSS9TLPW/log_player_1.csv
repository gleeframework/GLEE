Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, assuming Bob will reject it.  Since his money is worth less with each round, he'll likely want to counter-propose and try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more money, I'm aware that Bob is losing more value with each round. This offer is a significant improvement over the previous round, and I'm happy to take it."
