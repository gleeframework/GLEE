I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while securing most of the money for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not giving up 700,000 of the original amount that easily. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the current inflation rate and Bob's unreasonable initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn!  I'm not going to settle for a 40/60 split.  We're getting close to the halfway point, and I'm not going to back down.  It's time to counter his offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I've decided to propose a 50/50 split.  The money is depreciating quickly, and I'm not sure Bob will continue to be so stubborn.  This is a fair and equitable solution, and I think it's time we reached an agreement."
