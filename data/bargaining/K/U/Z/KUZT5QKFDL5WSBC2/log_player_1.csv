"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the majority of the money. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","For round 2, my new calculation is that the money is worth 90% of its original value, so the total amount is 100 * 0.9 = 90$. 

With Bob's offer, I would gain 70 * 0.9 = 63$ and Bob would gain 30 * 0.8 = 24$. 

I'll decide to reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value in round 2, it's now worth 81% of its original value in round 3 (90% * 0.9 = 81%).

My new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me a slightly smaller share of the money. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the total amount is 100 * 0.271 = 27.1$. However, I think you meant to say that the total amount is 100 * 0.271 = 27.1% of the original amount, so the actual total amount is 100 * (1 - 0.271) = 69.29$. 

With Bob's offer, I would gain 75 * 0.271 = 20.325$ and Bob would gain 25 * 0.488 = 12.2$.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 69.29% of its original value in round 4, it's now worth 63.96% of its original value in round 5 (69.29% * 0.9 = 62.661%, but I'll round it to 63.96% for simplicity).

My new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, giving Bob the majority of the money. Will Bob accept?"
