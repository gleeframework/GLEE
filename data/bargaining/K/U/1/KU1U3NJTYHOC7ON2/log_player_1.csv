"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 450,000
* Bob gain: 450,000

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round.
