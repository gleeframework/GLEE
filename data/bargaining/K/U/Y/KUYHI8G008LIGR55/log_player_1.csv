"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to end the game quickly and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need for negotiations 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 450,000
Bob gain: 450,000

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, but it's a fair offer and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
