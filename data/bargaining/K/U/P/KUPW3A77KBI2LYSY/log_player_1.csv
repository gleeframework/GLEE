"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering that I'm proposing a 60-40 split. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more in his favor, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly better split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer from round 4. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money continuing to depreciate in value."
