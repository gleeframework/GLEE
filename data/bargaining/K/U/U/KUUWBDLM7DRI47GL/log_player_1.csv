"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and then we can reassess and adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, now I'm offering you less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is offering me $4000, which is still a significant amount, I'll decide to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""}

I'm increasing the amount I'm offering to Bob, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise."
