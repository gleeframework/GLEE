"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but I think this is still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth $380,000, which is a significant reduction. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $600,000 is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise, while also hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth $257,400, which is a significant reduction. I'm not sure if this is a good enough deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
