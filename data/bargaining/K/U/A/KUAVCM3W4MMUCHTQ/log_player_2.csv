"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it in a traditional way. I'll take 75$, you'll get 25$. Fair enough? 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with getting only 25% of the money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a more fair split.  Let's be reasonable and get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust our shares. I propose we split it 60/40, which should account for the decrease in value. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, the inflation means I'm likely to get less with each round. This offer is better than the last one, and it seems like Alice is willing to compromise."
