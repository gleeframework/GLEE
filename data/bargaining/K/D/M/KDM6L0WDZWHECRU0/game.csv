6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer: I take $6000, you take $4000. We both walk away with something.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can do better than that, let's meet in the middle-ish.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, I think we can still negotiate a fairer outcome. It's your turn to propose next, let's see what you have in mind.",Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Okay, how about this: I get $5600, and you get $4400. This factors in the inflation a bit more, giving me a slight advantage in exchange for a quicker resolution.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation is hitting you harder. Let's see if we can settle this.",Bob,4,
,,"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a bit more on my end to make it worthwhile.  Let's try this again.",Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"This is getting tight with the inflation!  I'll come down a bit to $5300, leaving you with $4700. Let's close this out and avoid losing more to inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"If we're really continuing, considering the significant impact of inflation, I'll take a bit more. However, I believe we should have ended the game at the last round.",Bob,6,
,,"Alright, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I'll accept.",Alice,6,accept
