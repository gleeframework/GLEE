"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this fair offer, Bob. A larger share is only fair since I'm taking on more risk as the game goes on.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it doesn't reflect the increasing risk for me as time goes on. I'm proposing a compromise. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her initial split, even though the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. While her compromise is slightly better, it's not enough to offset the losses we're both incurring due to inflation. By rejecting, I signal I'm willing to wait for a more equitable deal, even if it means risking another round."

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're approaching a critical point where inflation is significantly impacting our potential gains. I'm proposing a 55/45 split - a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear we both want to end this before inflation hurts us more. I'm taking a slight hit to close the deal, but let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The deal is worth significantly less than it was in Round 1. Waiting any longer means we both lose more.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message implies this is her final offer. If I reject, she might be even less generous in the next round. 
* **Minimal Gain Difference:** While I'd prefer a more even split, the difference between her gain and mine is now relatively small, especially considering the inflation losses we'd face in another round.

It's not ideal, but accepting avoids the risk of walking away with even less."
