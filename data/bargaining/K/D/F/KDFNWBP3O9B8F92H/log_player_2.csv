"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a risky first round, but I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split right off the bat. I'll see what Alice's next offer is, considering inflation will impact me more than her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We're both facing inflation, so a 50/50 split seems like the best way to ensure we both get a decent share.""
