"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. My offer from round 1 was worth 80% of $10,000, but now that's only worth 64% of the original amount ($6,400). Bob's offer is worth 60% of the original amount ($6,000 for me and $4,000 for him).

I'll accept this offer.
