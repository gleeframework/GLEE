"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. This is a pretty standard starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

The effective value of the money I gain is 95% of $400,000, which is $380,000. The effective value of the money Bob gains is 90% of $600,000, which is $540,000.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept it.
