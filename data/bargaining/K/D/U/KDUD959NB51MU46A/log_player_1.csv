"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd like to get a better deal. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount.

I'll accept this offer.
