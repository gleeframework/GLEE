"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a slight adjustment to your previous offer""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the inflation that affects Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round, but the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial 50/50 proposal and the previous offers, taking into account the effects of inflation on Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my original compromise, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round, but the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Back to the original proposal, let's just split it 50/50 and be done with it""
}
```

I'm going back to my initial proposal, which I think is fair and reasonable. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the negotiation."
