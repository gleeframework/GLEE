"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. I'm willing to take the smaller share this round, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground this time, let's split it 50-50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same value in mind, and Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable middle ground.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
