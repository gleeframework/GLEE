"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm thinking of keeping most for myself. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. While it's tempting to get something, I'm not sure I want to give up 75% of the remaining value. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting higher, and the money is worth even less due to inflation!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping some value for myself."
