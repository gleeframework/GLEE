"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider the offer and potentially end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better.  Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but still keeping a slight edge. The message is a gentle push to see if Bob will meet me in the middle."
