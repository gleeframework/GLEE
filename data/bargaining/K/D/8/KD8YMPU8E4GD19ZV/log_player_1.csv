I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob just a dollar.  It's a risky move, but with inflation, I'm hoping he'll be desperate enough to take it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to be clever by offering me a smaller amount while taking the lion's share.  I won't be bullied.  I'll counter with a better offer for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. He rejected my first offer, so I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise, especially since he lost some of his potential gain due to inflation."
