"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $25. I believe this is fair given the potential inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Given the potential inflation, I think this is a fair and balanced deal that allows both of us to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
