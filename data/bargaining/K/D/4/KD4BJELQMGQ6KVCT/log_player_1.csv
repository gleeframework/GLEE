"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 50 dollars now is worth less to me than what I could potentially gain by making a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round.\n\n###\n\nWaiting for the next message..."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more. This way, we both still get a good share, but I get a slightly better deal to offset the loss from inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $58 and Bob receives $42. I've taken into account the effects of inflation and adjusted my proposal to ensure I get a slightly better deal to compensate for the loss in value. The message explains my reasoning and aims to persuade Bob to accept the offer.\n\nYour turn! Please respond as Bob.\n\n###\n\nWaiting for your response..."
