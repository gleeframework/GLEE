Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  If you reject this, you'll get less in the next round, and I'm not sure what I'll offer after that. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use pressure tactics, but the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for me, holding out for a better deal in the next couple of rounds is a risk worth taking."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair split. I'm willing to be generous, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure and inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us. It's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
- **Inflation Disparity:** My losses due to inflation are higher than Alice's. While holding out might seem like a good strategy, the decreasing value of the money means I need to aim for a favorable split now.
- **Fairness:** This offer is a compromise. It acknowledges that Alice deserves a significant share, but it also ensures that I am not getting a raw deal."
