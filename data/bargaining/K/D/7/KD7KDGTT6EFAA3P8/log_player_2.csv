"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get something, while I secure the larger share.  Every round that passes hurts you more than me due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressures, but your previous offer was too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer still guarantees you a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's compromise is appreciated, I still believe I can secure a more favorable deal. The inflation is hurting me significantly, and I need to maximize my gains before it's too late."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but your offers aren't reflecting the reality of our situation.  The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for you. This is my final compromise. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure something before the value of my share plummets further. While this isn't ideal, it's the best I can get at this point."
