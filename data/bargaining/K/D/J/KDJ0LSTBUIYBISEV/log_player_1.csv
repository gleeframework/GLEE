**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Bob. This means that waiting for a potentially better offer in the future is increasingly risky.
* **Bob's Desperation:**  Bob's offer has decreased from his initial 550,000, indicating a willingness to compromise due to the rapid devaluation of his potential gains.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round (if there even is one) carries a significant risk.  The potential increase in Alice's share might be minimal compared to the guaranteed loss in value due to inflation.

While 420,000 is less than half the initial amount, it's crucial to remember the context of the game and the impact of inflation. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable sum for Alice rather than risking a worse outcome by waiting."
