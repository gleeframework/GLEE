Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more fair split, considering we both lose value with each round. Let's end this quickly and both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
