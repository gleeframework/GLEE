"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
This is a good starting point, and it's smart to reject.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is not fair.**  She's getting 600,000 while you only get 400,000.
* **Inflation is in your favor.** You'll be proposing in the next round, and the money will be worth less for Alice.

By rejecting, you create pressure on Alice to offer you a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a fairer split, considering inflation will be less favorable for you in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is the best I can do 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a bigger share, and while her offer is slightly better, you can still do better.  Inflation is working in your favor, so keep pushing for a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. With inflation, my offer is the fairest way to split the money now.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still not fair, and inflation is heavily impacting her.  Reject and keep pushing for a better split in your favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000, ""message"": ""Time is running out.  This is a fair offer considering the effects of inflation on both of us.""}
