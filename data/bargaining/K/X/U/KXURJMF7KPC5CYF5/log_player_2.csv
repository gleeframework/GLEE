"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than another round.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice loses value in the deal much faster than Bob (20% vs 5% each round). This means time pressure benefits Bob.
* **Improving on Round 1:** Alice's opening offer was heavily in her favor. Bob needs to shift the balance but still offer something that seems appealing considering the declining value.
* **Avoiding a Low Offer:** If Bob gets greedy, Alice might reject it hoping for a better deal in a later round, even with the declining value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, don't wait for inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is feeling the pressure:** Her counter-offer is better for Bob than her initial offer, showing she's concerned about the declining value.
* **Still room for improvement:**  While closer to a fair split, Alice's offer still favors her. Bob's time advantage means he can likely push for a slightly better deal. 
* **Risk vs Reward:**  There's a risk Alice will offer even less in the next round. However, the potential reward of a better offer from Alice, or getting to make a counter-offer in round 4, is worth the small risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a fair split before inflation hurts us both further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Tide is Turning:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively better for Bob. He now has the upper hand.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While Bob could push for a more significant advantage, offering a near 50/50 split makes him appear fair and might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Limited Time:**  While Alice loses value faster, Bob's potential gain also diminishes each round. It's time to secure a favorable outcome."
