"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, Bob.  I'm feeling generous, so I'll take a slightly larger share considering the inflation factor. This way we both walk away with a good amount! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal considering the inflation factor that affects Alice more significantly."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. Let's be practical and split it evenly. This is the fairest outcome, especially with the inflation working against me.  A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given the inflation factor impacting Alice more with each round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. A 50/50 split doesn't account for the decreasing value of the money for Alice, which gives me leverage for a more favorable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to be a fair deal for both of us. Considering the significant impact of inflation, I'm proposing a 47.5/52.5 split.  This recognizes the value difference while still providing you with a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Given the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share, which is now worth 18.55% less than in the first round, I believe I can negotiate an even better deal in the next round. The proposed 47.5/52.5 split still doesn't fully account for the substantial decrease in value for Alice, giving me leverage for a more favorable split.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  I understand the impact of inflation is increasing, but I need to secure a reasonable amount. This split acknowledges the changing value and provides us both with a decent outcome. If you decline, I'm worried we'll both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share, which is now worth 26.49% less than in the first round, and considering Alice's message that this is her final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the most prudent decision. The proposed split of 55/45 is reasonable, and the risk of walking away with nothing if I decline outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating further. It's time to conclude the negotiation and secure a favorable outcome."
