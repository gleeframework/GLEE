"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide the money with a 3:1 ratio. This ensures we both benefit, but I'm willing to take a larger share for our cooperation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  I'm willing to give you a larger share than Alice's proposal, but I think this split is fairer considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
