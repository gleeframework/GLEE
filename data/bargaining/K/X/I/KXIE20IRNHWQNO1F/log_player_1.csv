  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering I'll be getting 40% of a smaller amount due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
