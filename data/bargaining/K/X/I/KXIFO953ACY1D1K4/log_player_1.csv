"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money. I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get the lion's share. I won't accept this offer.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, but still offer Bob a significant amount to incentivize him to accept.  I'm confident that if we go further, inflation will hurt both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.  I'll counter with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount to myself than in the previous round, but still a decent share.  I'm hoping to get Bob to see that it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation eats away at his potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a huge share of the money, even though inflation is now significantly impacting both of us. I'm not willing to accept an offer this low, even though I'm losing a lot due to the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, even though the inflation is hitting me hard.  This is a risky move, but I'm hoping that Bob realizes we're both losing money rapidly, and he'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing at all."
