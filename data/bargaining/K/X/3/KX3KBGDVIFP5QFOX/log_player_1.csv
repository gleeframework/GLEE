"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  We can both benefit from ending this early, considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
