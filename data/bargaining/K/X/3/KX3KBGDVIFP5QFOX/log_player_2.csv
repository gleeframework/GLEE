"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point.  Let's split the money with me taking a slightly larger share.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's proposal seems ""fair"" on the surface,  Bob should reject it.  The inflation will have a significant impact over time, making this initial offer much less appealing in later rounds. By rejecting, Bob gains the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  We can both benefit from ending this early, considering the inflation risk.""
