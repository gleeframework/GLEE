"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money to see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 50/50 and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual value of the 50 I would gain is 90% of the original value. So, the effective value I would gain is $45.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially gain more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, which means it's 10% of 90% of the original value, or 81% of the original value. So, the effective value of the money I gain is 81% of the original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 40 is a fair amount for me. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money I would gain in round 4. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and the first-round value was $80, the effective value I would gain is 72.9% of $80, which is approximately $58.32.

Comparing this to Bob's offer of $60, I think I'm getting a slightly better deal. I'll accept this offer.
