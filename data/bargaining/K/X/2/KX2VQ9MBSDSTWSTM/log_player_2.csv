Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, not me 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time limit. However, I need to consider the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Accepting $4,400 now is a terrible deal compared to what I could have gotten earlier. I'll hold out a little longer and hope she gets nervous."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was cute, but I'm the one with the upper hand here 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While $4,300 is significantly less than I wanted at the start, it's still better than getting $0 if this drags on too much longer. Alice is clearly content to wait me out."
