"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go 60/40, but this time in my favor. It's only fair since you got the better deal last round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about Bob's attempt to flip the script on me, but I'll consider his offer.

After recalculating the numbers, I realize that the 5% decrease in my gains and the 20% decrease in Bob's gains have made the 60/40 split in his favor a bit more palatable.

I'll decide to...
