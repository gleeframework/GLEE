"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is not fair, and I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 45% for me, 55% for you.""}\n\nI've made a counteroffer that is more reasonable, considering the inflation factor that affects me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than Alice's initial offer. Let's see how she responds!"
