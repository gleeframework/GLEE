Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that offer was too tilted in your favor. Let's be fair, I think this split accounts for the time-pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's rejection:** Bob rejecting my initial offer indicates he's aiming for a larger share than 35%. His counter-offer, while presented as ""fair,"" heavily favors him, especially considering the inflation working against me. 
* **Time pressure:**  It's crucial to acknowledge the time pressure. While Bob's offer is tempting in the short term, each round diminishes the overall value. My offer is still tilted in my favor, but less drastically than his.
* **Compromise:** My new offer is a compromise. It acknowledges the time pressure by offering Bob a more substantial sum than my initial offer, while still securing a majority share for myself before inflation further erodes its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time! This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant inflation:** The inflation has significantly impacted the deal's value. Accepting 480,000 now is better than potentially receiving even less in the next round.
* **Bob's final offer:**  Bob explicitly stated this is his final offer. It implies he's unwilling to concede further and is likely to propose an even less favorable deal in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. The potential reward of securing a slightly larger share in the next round is outweighed by the certainty of losing more money to inflation. 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 secures me a reasonable amount before inflation further diminishes the overall value."
