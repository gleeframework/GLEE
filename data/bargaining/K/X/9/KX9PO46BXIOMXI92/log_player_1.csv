"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, and keeping 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my effective gain in Round 2 would be 80% of the original 80%, which is 64. And Bob's offer is 40% of the original 100, which is 40.

I'll accept this offer.
