"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take 999,000$ and give Bob 1,000$.  Let's see if he's willing to accept such a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount, and the risk of getting nothing if we keep playing is too high."
