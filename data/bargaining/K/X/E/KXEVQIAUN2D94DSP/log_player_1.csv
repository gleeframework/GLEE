"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting offer, considering we have 12 rounds to reach an agreement.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfair, and he has taken advantage of the inflation by proposing a higher gain for himself. I will reject and try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'll propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair and balanced offer considering the inflation.  It's time to see if Bob is ready to compromise."
