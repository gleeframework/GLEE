"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n
I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share to account for the potential decrease in value due to inflation in subsequent rounds, while still being relatively fair. This way, Bob has an incentive to accept the offer rather than risking a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage since you made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n
I'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 4500 in the second round is equivalent to accepting less than what I would have gotten in the first round. By rejecting, I aim to either get a better offer in the next round or make a new proposal that benefits me more, despite the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts, I need a bigger share""}\n
Considering the inflation in the previous rounds, the value of the money has decreased. I'll offer Bob a smaller share to compensate for the loss in value and to try to reach an agreement before the money loses even more value. This way, I'm still being somewhat fair but also taking into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n
Although the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, accepting 5000 in the fourth round is still a relatively fair deal, considering we're splitting it evenly. Since the money's value will continue to decrease with each round, it's better to accept this offer now rather than risking an even worse deal in the next round.\n\n###"
