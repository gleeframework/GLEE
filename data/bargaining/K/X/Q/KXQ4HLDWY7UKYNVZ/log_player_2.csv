"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 40/60 split seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Since I'm Bob, I want to maximize my potential earnings, and rejecting gives me the chance to propose a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's try a more balanced split this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly more generous offer this time, but I think I deserve a bit more since the money is worth less now. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd ideally want more, the inflation is starting to impact the value of the money significantly.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and given the decreasing value, it's a reasonable compromise."
