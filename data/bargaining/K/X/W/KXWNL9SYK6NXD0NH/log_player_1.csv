"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to benefit, while acknowledging the potential inflation issue.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the risk of inflation, and we both still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
