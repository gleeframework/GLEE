"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is still a 60-40 split, but with a smaller amount, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the reduced value of money, but still trying to get a slightly larger share."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
