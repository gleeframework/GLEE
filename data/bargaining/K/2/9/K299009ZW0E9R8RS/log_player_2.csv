Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not a good deal for me. It's better to see what Alice will offer next round, since I know the money will be worth less for me then, but that applies to Alice too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
