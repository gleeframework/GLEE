"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this split is more fair. Let's see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer isn't considering the inflation. I'm losing value with each round. This proposal is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing more money with each passing round."
