"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's settle now!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."

# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering our respective inflation rates. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer.
