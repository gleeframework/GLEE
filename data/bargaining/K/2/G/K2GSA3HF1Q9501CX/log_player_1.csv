"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed by your first offer. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the new amounts are:

* My gain: $200,000 (20% less than the original $250,000)
* Bob's gain: $784,000 (5% less than the original $828,000)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, so the amounts are:

* My gain: $160,000 (20% less than the previous $200,000)
* Bob's gain: $744,800 (5% less than the previous $784,000)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 160000,
  ""bob_gain"": 840000,
  ""message"": ""My offer is more modest this time. Consider it carefully.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you have it all. Be more generous next time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Let's calculate the new amounts:

* My gain: $100,000 (48.8% less than the original $200,000)
* Bob's gain: $860,000 (14.26% less than the original $1,000,000)

Considering the reduced amounts, I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's still a decent amount for me. I'll think carefully...

For now, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
