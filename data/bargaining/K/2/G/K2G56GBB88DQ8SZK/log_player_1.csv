Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm the first to propose, so I'm taking a larger share, but I'm still offering Bob a decent amount.  Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is much less favorable to me than my initial proposal, it's still better than what I would get in the next round due to inflation. 

* **My gain:** 300,000 * 0.95 = 285,000 (after 5% inflation)
* **Bob's gain:** 700,000 * 0.90 = 630,000 (after 10% inflation)

If I reject this offer, I get to make a proposal in the next round, but my share will be worth even less due to the ongoing inflation. It's better to accept this offer and secure at least some money."
