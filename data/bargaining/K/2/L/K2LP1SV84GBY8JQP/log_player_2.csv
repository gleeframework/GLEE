"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after each round, I'll make a proposal that takes that into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}

This way, I'm leaving room for Alice to negotiate, but also getting a decent share of the initial $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is similar to mine from round 2, but with a slightly more favorable split for her. I'll stick to my original plan and reject her offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, and I want to adjust for that, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Alice is sticking to her previous offer, adjusting for the inflation. Given the reduced value of the money, I'll consider this offer carefully. Since it's a relatively even split, I'll accept it.
