"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I'd like to try and get a better deal. A 50/50 split might not be as valuable to me in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more. 60/40?""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each passing round, I'll try to get a slightly better deal to compensate for the loss. A 60/40 split seems reasonable, given the circumstances.\n\nPlease proceed and let me know Alice's decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. 60/40 is a reasonable split, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth 36% less to me now, I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I'll try to negotiate further, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal.\n\n###\n\nKeep in mind that the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, so I'll need to consider that when making my next offer.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please let me know the current value of the money for me in the next round. I want to make an informed decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. 55/45, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less to me now, and it will be worth even less in the next round, I'll try to find a compromise. A 55/45 split seems reasonable, taking into account the loss of value.\n\nPlease proceed and let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\nKeep in mind that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that the money's value is decreasing rapidly for me.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please let me know the current value of the money for me in this round. I want to make an informed decision."
