"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's start with this!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so the offer from Bob is actually a bit more generous than it seems.

I'll think about it for a moment... and decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I can gain!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think about it for a moment... and decide to accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50-50 split seems like a fair compromise, and I'm willing to take it!"
