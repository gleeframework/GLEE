I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is ridiculous!  While I understand inflation is affecting both of us, Bob's offer is completely unfair.  I'm not going to accept a mere $5 while he takes the lion's share.  I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the inflation but also holding firm to a more equitable distribution."
