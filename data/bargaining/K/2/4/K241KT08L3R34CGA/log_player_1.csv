Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each round.  Let's find a middle ground before the inflation eats away at our gains completely. I'm willing to compromise further. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely than Alice.  Each round makes his potential share significantly less valuable. 
* **Downward Trend:**  Bob's offers have been getting progressively better for Alice. This indicates he's feeling the squeeze and is more likely to make further concessions as time goes on.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is risky.  There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal, and even if he does, it might not outweigh the loss in value due to another round of inflation on his end. 

Accepting $600,000 guarantees a significant sum for Alice and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
