Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 475000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting your gain, I think it's reasonable to adjust my previous offer. I'm willing to give you 420,000, which is still a significant amount. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my losses due to inflation. While 420,000 is a significant sum, it's a much smaller proportion than what I would have received in earlier rounds. It's better to hold out and see if I can secure a more favorable deal, even with the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split.  This is fair and avoids further losses for both of us due to inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's round 4, and the longer this drags on, the more I lose due to inflation.  A quick resolution is becoming essential.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is undeniably fair. By sticking to this point, I put pressure on Alice to justify her desire for a larger share. 
* **Finality:**  The ""take it or leave it"" language signals that I'm serious and unlikely to budge much further. This might push Alice to accept, especially if she's also feeling the pressure of the game's dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to rush, but I still think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation is hitting your side harder, I'll give you 450,000. Take it before it's worth even less! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the more I stand to lose. Accepting 450,000 now is better than risking an even lower offer in a future round.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems fixated on getting a larger share and is unlikely to agree to anything close to 50/50, especially with the perceived advantage she holds due to the inflation mechanism.
* **Bird in Hand:** It's tempting to hold out for a better deal, but there's no guarantee Alice will ever offer more. Accepting a decent amount now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
