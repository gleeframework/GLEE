"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and saves us both time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but my previous offer was already generous. This is the best I can do.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money decreases faster for Bob (10% per round) than Alice (5% per round). It's in Bob's best interest to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's willing to risk going further. This puts him in a slightly stronger bargaining position.
* **Appearance of Compromise:** While the offer is only a slight improvement for Alice, framing it as a compromise might make it more appealing and prevent her from becoming overly aggressive in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases faster for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Alice's offer is significantly worse for Bob than her previous offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to what was potentially achievable.
* **Possible Bluff:** Alice stating it's her final offer could be a bluff to pressure Bob. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While the money is losing value, Bob still holds some power.  There's a chance Alice might be bluffing or will make a more reasonable offer in the next round rather than risk walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a repeat of your first offer, which was already tilted in your favor. Let's end this here before we both lose out more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Repetition:**  By offering Alice the same terms she initially proposed, Bob highlights the decreasing value of the money. This emphasizes that continuing the game hurts both of them.
* **Shifting Blame:** The message subtly puts the onus on Alice for any further losses due to inflation if she rejects. 
* **Protecting Value:** While Bob would prefer a better split, accepting Alice's original offer now prevents further erosion of his potential gain. It's a pragmatic move to secure a reasonable amount."
