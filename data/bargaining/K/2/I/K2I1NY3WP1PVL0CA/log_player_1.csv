"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, Bob's offer is equivalent to him taking 18.18% of the original $10,000, which is a decent compromise.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
