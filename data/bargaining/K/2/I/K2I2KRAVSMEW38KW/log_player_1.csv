"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to get started. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll accept Bob's offer of 50/50 split, as it seems fair and we're meeting in the middle. I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more reduced value of the money.
