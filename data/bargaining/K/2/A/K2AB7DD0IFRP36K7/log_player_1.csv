This offer gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to take a larger share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation is working against me. This offer is still a decent gain, and I'd rather not risk getting less in the next round."
