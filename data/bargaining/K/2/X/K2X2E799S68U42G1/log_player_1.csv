"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $5,000, which is better than risking further losses in the next round."
