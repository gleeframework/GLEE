Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need at least 52 to make this worth it for me. It's getting too risky for me to go another round. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, as it's less than Bob proposed in the previous round. However, here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Inflation:** The value of the deal is diminishing rapidly for Alice.  While Bob's value remains steady, another round means Alice's potential gains shrink even further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for 55 is risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more in the next round, and she might even drop her offer lower due to the inflation working against her. 
* **""Bird in the Hand"":** 48 is a reasonable amount, and it's better to secure a decent deal now than risk getting a worse offer (or even nothing) if the game continues."
