"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets the stage for me to make a slightly more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable, and since the inflation affects him more than me, I'll accept it."
