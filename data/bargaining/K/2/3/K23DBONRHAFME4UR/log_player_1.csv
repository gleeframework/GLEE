"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a bit more this time. I'll accept Bob's offer if I can get at least 58. The 55 offered is a bit short, but I'll take it.
