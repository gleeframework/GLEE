"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message that I'm splitting it fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly. How about 60/40 in my favor this time? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth $3,600.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too uneven, I'd like a more equal split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $3,600 in the second round is now worth $3,240.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you 45%""
}
