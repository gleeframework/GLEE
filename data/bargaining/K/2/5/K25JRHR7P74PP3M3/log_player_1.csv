"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to flip the script on you this round, Alice. Let's see if you're willing to be more flexible. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script on me!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to accept the reduced value of the money due to inflation. In this round, my gain would be 400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2. My gain would be 380,000 * 0.95 = 361,000.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's find a compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which seems more reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
