"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and can adjust later if needed."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to reassess my decision.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to take a bit more to compensate. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation. Let's try again!""
}
```"
