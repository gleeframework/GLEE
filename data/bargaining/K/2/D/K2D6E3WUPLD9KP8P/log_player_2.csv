"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic ultimatum game with a twist of inflation. While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the inflation element significantly benefits Bob in later rounds. It's worth seeing if Alice will offer a larger share to avoid losing money to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but how about we make things a little more even? This deal accounts for the money losing value over time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation and is moving closer to a more even split. However, the inflation is working heavily in my favor.  It's still beneficial for me to see if I can secure an even better deal as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  Let's settle this fairly and avoid both losing out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering a deal that appears ""fair"" at first glance.  The pressure is mounting on Alice as the value of the money decreases for her with every passing round.  This offer might be tempting enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's split the difference. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, offering a split that's closer to her original offer. However, with each round, the value tilts more in my favor.  The risk of holding out is getting smaller, as Alice will soon be very motivated to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time to be realistic, Alice. This offer ensures we both walk away with something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned. I'm now pushing for a larger share,  knowing Alice is feeling the heat of the shrinking pot. This offer is still within the realm of ""somewhat reasonable"" but heavily favors me. The goal is to capitalize on Alice's increasing risk aversion as the game enters its later stages."
