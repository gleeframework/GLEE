"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll be tempted to accept it quickly before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option.  Even though Bob is getting a much bigger share, the inflation would likely eat away at my potential gains if I were to keep rejecting offers.  This at least ensures I get something."
