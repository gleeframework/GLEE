"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't like the fact that Bob is getting a larger share than me, but I don't want to waste time on more rounds if I can get a decent deal. I'll accept this offer.
