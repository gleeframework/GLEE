"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to make a more aggressive proposal in the next round to account for the reduced value.

For now, I'll {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 5% inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which should give me a bit more breathing room considering the reduced value of my share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard! Given the significant reduction in the value of my share, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal.

However, I'll consider Bob's offer. While it's still an uneven split, it's not as bad as the previous one. I'll {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer, hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the future."
