"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. And Bob's gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $4,750 in the first round.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best option for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the 20% decrease in value.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a 55-45 split, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $4,000 is equivalent to $7,934.49 in the first round (since it's worth 48.8% less).
Bob's gain of $6,000 is equivalent to $7,068.92 in the first round (since it's worth 14.26% less).

With this in mind, I'll have to decide whether to accept the offer. I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.

I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
