"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 40% of $100 = $40
Bob gain: 60% of $100 = $60

The actual values are $38.4 for me and $61.6 for Bob.

Considering the reduced value due to inflation, I think this offer is not bad. I'll accept Bob's offer.
