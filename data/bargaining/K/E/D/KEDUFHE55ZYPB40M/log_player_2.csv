"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less now, and Alice's offer is still a 52-48 split, I'll take it.
