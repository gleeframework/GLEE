Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a generous share considering the time pressure.  Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but the deal is still not good for Bob.  While her gains are decreasing significantly due to inflation, she needs to feel the pressure more to offer a larger share to Bob.  There's still a chance to get a better deal."
