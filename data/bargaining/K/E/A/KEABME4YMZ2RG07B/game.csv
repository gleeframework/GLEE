6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I take $6000, you get $4000. We can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think we can both do better. I'm willing to take a slight cut now to avoid the inflation risk, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer in the long run.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I'll take a small step back from my initial offer.  $5500 for me, $4500 for you. This way we both get a decent share before inflation eats away too much.",Alice,3,
