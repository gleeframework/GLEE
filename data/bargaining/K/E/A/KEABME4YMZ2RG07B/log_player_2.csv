Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I'll take a small step back from my initial offer.  $5500 for me, $4500 for you. This way we both get a decent share before inflation eats away too much. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
