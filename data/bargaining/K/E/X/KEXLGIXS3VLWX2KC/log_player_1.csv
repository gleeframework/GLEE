"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 80-20 in my favor. I'll give you a chance to improve your share in the next round.""
}
```

I'm starting with an 80-20 split, giving me the larger share. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate."
