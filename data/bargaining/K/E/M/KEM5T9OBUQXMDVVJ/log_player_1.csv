"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. 

This offer is fair, as it ensures that I, as the first proposer, get a larger share of the money. However, it is not overly greedy, as it still gives Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
