Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
