"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money equally, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation. Rejecting and proposing my own offer gives me a chance to potentially get a larger share of the remaining money after the inflation discount is applied."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the inflation risk. I believe this is a fair compromise given the potential loss of value in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 54/46 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would ideally get a bigger share, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the remaining money. Considering the inflation, further rounds could result in a smaller gain."
