"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair, reflecting our equal contributions to the game. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51/49 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, we do need to divide the money quickly to avoid losing value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can do better in the next round.
