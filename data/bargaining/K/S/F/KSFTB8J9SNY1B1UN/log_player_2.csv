"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work out a better split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000$ is a good start, it's worth pushing for a better deal.  Alice is starting strong, but I can try to get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have to agree. Let's see if we can work something out!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, but 80/20 is still a fair starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While 200,000$ is better than nothing, it's still a very unequal split.  I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer deal.  There's still a lot of rounds left!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money down the middle. 50/50 is the most equitable way to divide it. It's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's end this on a good note.""}
