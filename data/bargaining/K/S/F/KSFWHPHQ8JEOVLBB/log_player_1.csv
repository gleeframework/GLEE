"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This way, we can end the game quickly and avoid the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the real value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be strategic.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take this offer and we can wrap up the game!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a higher share of the remaining value, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Don't pass it up this time! 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is slightly better than the previous one, I'll consider accepting it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money."
