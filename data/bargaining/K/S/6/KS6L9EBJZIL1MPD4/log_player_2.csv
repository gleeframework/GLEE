Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but your last offer was too low. This offer is more balanced and ensures we both benefit. Let's close this deal.

# Alice gain: 6500

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise. It gives you a slight advantage, but we both need to agree soon before the inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but time is on my side more than hers. My losses are accelerating faster, making her more likely to offer a larger share to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4300, ""alice_gain"": 5700, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to wrap this up.  This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the value shrinks faster for me. Let's be done with this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but keeping the pressure on Alice. The faster depreciation of my potential gains makes it increasingly risky for her to hold out for a much larger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the circumstances. We're running out of time, and further negotiation will only hurt both of us. Let's be sensible and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly holding her ground, and while this offer isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. The inflation is quickly eroding the potential gains, and accepting now guarantees me something.  It's a tough decision, but the risk of getting zero is too high to hold out for a potentially slightly better deal."
