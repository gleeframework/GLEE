"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start low! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's my turn to make a proposal next and I don't want to risk losing more money. I'll just have to wait for the next round to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
