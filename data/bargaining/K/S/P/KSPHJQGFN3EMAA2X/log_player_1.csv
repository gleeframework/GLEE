"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, as it's heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
