"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, you get a smaller share but it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but it's a fair starting point for the negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, so I need to consider that when making my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better share. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a significant portion of the money to be fair""
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share significantly, but still leave Bob with a small amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth significantly less for Bob, so I need to consider that when making my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, I'd like to negotiate further to try to get an even better share. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a tiny share, but I need most of the money to be fair""
}
```

I'm trying to take a large share of the remaining money, but still leaving Bob with a small amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a very small share, but I think this is the best I can get at this point 
# Alice gain: 8500 
# Bob gain: 1500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth significantly less for Bob, so I need to consider that when making my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept an 85/15 split, as I think it's a fair compromise given the current state of the negotiations. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns. Your turn, Bob!"
