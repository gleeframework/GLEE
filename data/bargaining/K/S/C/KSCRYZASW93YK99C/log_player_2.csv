Let's see what I can get in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly better deal than she offered me, but still keeping the majority for myself. Let's see if she bites!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I think it's better to take what I can get before the inflation gets worse.  It's a significant drop in my share, but still better than nothing."
