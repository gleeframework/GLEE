# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it. With the 20% decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'm not getting as much as I was hoping for.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! I'll offer you 400000, and I'll take the rest.""}
