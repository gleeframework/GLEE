"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this and we can wrap things up!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round. I'll take more this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take more, huh?

Since the money is worth 20% less this round, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'll accept this offer. I'll wait for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking more this round, but I'm not going to get left with nothing. This is my best offer so far.""

```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent amount and keeping some for myself."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure I want to accept this offer. Bob is taking a huge chunk, and I'm not getting much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep negotiating!"

# Bob's message: I'm not budging. You'll have to make a better offer if you want me to accept. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value, I'm not sure I want to accept this offer. $100,000 is a tiny fraction of the original amount, and I'm not getting a fair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better offer!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of options. I'm taking what I want. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing the value of the money!

Considering the drastically reduced value, I'm not sure I have a choice but to accept this offer. $50,000 is a tiny fraction of the original amount, and I'm not sure I can do any better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I guess I'm accepting Bob's offer. Better than going home with nothing!"
