"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a good starting point, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. My goal is to get as much as possible, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, my offer needs to be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my share is now worth significantly less than it was initially. Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my share of $400,000 is equivalent to about 43.6% of the initial $1,000,000. This is a relatively generous offer from Bob, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
