"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. I'm hoping that the slight unevenness in the split will be acceptable to Bob, considering that it's the first round and we both want to avoid the devaluation of the money. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my offer in this round is more than fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth less in this round, I think I deserve a larger share. I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal in the next round, hoping to get a better deal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the devaluation of the money and offering Bob $43, while I take $57. Given that the money is worth less for both of us, I believe this is a reasonable proposal. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
