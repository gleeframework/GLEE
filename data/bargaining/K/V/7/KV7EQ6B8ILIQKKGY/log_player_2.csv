**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while the value of the money rapidly declines for both of us.  She's likely hoping I'll panic as we get closer to the deadline and accept a bad deal.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  Accept it now, or we both lose!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's time to play hardball.
* **Fairness:**  While I was initially aiming for a slightly favorable split, a 50/50 split is objectively fair and avoids further negotiation. 
* **Ultimatum:**  By making this my ""final offer"", I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She knows I'm serious and that further stalling will only hurt both of us."
