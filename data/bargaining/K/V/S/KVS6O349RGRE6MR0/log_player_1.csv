Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money.  I'm assuming Bob will be tempted to accept since this is the first round and he doesn't know about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even with the inflation, this offer is still much better than the 5% I would get if I reject and continue to the next round.  I'll take it!"
