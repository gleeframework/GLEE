"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most sensible.  Let's settle this now and avoid losing even more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob can likely push for a more favorable split as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 625000,
""alice_gain"": 375000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking for both of us."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Apply pressure:** By stating it's his final offer, Bob creates a sense of urgency.
* **Slight concession:**  Bob is giving a little ground from his Round 2 offer, making it seem like a tough but fair compromise.
* **Inflation factor:**  While Bob is losing value, Alice is losing it much faster. This offer might seem appealing to her before her share diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. Let's be realistic and split this evenly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Even Split:** Alice is finally offering a fair and equal split of the money.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly significant. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout for both parties.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal carries the risk of Alice becoming even more desperate and offering even less favorable terms or time running out entirely. 

Accepting the even split ensures a decent payout and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
