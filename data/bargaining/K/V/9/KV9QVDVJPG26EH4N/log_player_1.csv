"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me! Given the reduced value of the money, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll have to be more aggressive in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
