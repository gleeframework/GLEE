"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round, Bob. Take this as a starting point and let's see where this goes. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives me only 10% of the total amount, and I'm hoping to get a larger share. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I think 40% is a fair share for me, considering the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for you in each subsequent round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable here. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away more than 30% for you. It's getting riskier for both of us with every passing round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I still believe I can get a better deal than 30% of the total amount. Since Alice is also losing value on her share, I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise further in the next rounds. Let's proceed!###\n\n###
