"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair and reasonable split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my offer so quickly!

Considering the new offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 3000 / 0.95 (5% inflation) = 3157.89
Bob's gain: 7000 / 0.80 (20% inflation) = 8750

I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
