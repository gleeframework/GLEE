"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, I'll get the bigger share, but it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share now, but I'm hoping to improve my chances later! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not thrilled about taking only 25% of the remaining amount, but I'll have to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
