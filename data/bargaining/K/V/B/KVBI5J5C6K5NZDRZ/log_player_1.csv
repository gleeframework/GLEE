"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the risk of inflation eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to have more than 5000, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum.  The risk of further inflation makes it unwise to gamble on getting a better deal in later rounds."
