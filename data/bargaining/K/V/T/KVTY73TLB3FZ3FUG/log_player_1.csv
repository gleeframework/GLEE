"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This offer gives me $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain would be $4,500 and Bob's gain would be $4,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
