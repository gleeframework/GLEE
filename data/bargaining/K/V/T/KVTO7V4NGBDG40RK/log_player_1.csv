Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### I decided to accept Bob's offer since it's a fair split and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Continuing the game would likely lead to further losses due to inflation."
