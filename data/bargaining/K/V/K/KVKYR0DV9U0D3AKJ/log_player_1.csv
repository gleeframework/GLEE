"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can both walk away with a decent sum!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving Bob with $2,000. This way, we both get a decent chunk of money and can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather get more than 50% of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's 50/50 offer because I'd like to get a larger share of the remaining money. I'm willing to wait for a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a significant portion of the money to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving Bob with $4,000. This way, I'm still getting a larger share, but it's a bit more balanced than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reassess Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the $3,000 and call it a day. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's not the best deal, it's better than walking away with nothing. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'd rather take what I can get."
