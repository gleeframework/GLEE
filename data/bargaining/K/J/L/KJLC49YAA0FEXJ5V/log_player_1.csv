"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3200, and Bob's gain of $6000 is actually worth $4800.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, I'd like a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the initial $10,000, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bigger chunk of the remaining value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the reduced value due to inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, my gain of $3000 is actually worth $1560.80, and Bob's gain of $7000 is actually worth $3620.40.

I'm not happy with the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider this offer. I'll accept this offer, as it's better than continuing to negotiate.
