Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping inflation will force me to accept a bad deal.  While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, I still have some leverage. It's time to show I'm serious about not getting pushed around."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was too little, too late 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic.  While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I keep rejecting her proposals. The inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains. Taking this offer now ensures I at least get something."
