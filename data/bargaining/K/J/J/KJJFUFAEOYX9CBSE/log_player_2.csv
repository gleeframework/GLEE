"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a little more since I lose value faster. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% decrease in value for me is less than the 10% decrease for Alice, so I have more to gain by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. A straight 50/50 split is the fairest I can do. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split at this point is actually in my favor, since the money is worth less for Alice than it is for me. I'll take this offer before the value decreases further."
