60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60 and you take $40. This seems fair considering the inflation we are facing. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think we can do better. I'll take $60, and you get $40.  This is a fair split given the inflation, and allows us to both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be reasonable. I'm taking a hit with this inflation, so how about a compromise?  I'll take $55 and you take $45. It's a better deal than you'll get if we continue.",Alice,3,
