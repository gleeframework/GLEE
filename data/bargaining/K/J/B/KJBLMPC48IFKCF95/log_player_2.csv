"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this measly dollar and we can be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it's extremely unfair. Alice is trying to give me only $1 out of $1,000,000, which is essentially nothing. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer. Since Alice's money is worth 20% less in each round, she should be motivated to accept a fair offer sooner rather than later. I'll offer her a significant amount, but still try to get a good deal for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this evenly. I'm tired of the back and forth.  Inflation is making me nervous! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Since Alice's money is worth 36% less than in the first round, her $500,000 is actually worth much less than the initial value. Meanwhile, my $500,000 is still worth its full value. This means I'm effectively getting more than half of the original value, making this a good deal for me.
