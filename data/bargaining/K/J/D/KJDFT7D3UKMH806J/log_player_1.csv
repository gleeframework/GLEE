I'm offering Bob $40 and I'll take $60. I think it's a generous offer, considering I'm starting the negotiations. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more in my favor, but still a decent deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I'm taking into account that the money is worth less now, so I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. I think this is a reasonable compromise. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
