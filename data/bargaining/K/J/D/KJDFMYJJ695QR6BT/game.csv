,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think a 55/45 split is fairer given our different inflation rates.  Let's end this quickly.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Okay, let's adjust the split a bit.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think a 60/40 split is fair given our respective inflation rates. Let's end this quickly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
35.0,65.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 65/35 split is fairer.  Let's get this done.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway.  A 65/35 split is a fair compromise given our current inflation rates and the fact that we've gone through several rounds already. Let's finish this.,Alice,5,
