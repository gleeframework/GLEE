Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
# Alice gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a slightly tricky situation, but accepting is the most logical choice:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value. While Alice's offer isn't incredibly generous, waiting longer means both of you get even less.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She might propose an even less favorable split.
* **Present Value:** 47.5 is a decent chunk of the money. Accepting ensures Bob gets something rather than risking getting even less later."
