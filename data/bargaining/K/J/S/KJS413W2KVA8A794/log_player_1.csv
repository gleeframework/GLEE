"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 90% of the money, and you can have the remaining 10%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 50/50 split is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise, and I'm willing to settle for 500,000$."
