Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and take 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which I believe is a reasonable and generous offer, considering that I am giving him 40% of the total amount. I am hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game in this round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, accepting now is better for both of us than letting this drag on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe that a 55/45 split in his favor is not fair, considering that I was willing to give him 40% of the total amount in the first round. I am willing to make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I have rejected his offer and that it is now my turn again."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 460,000 dollars, which is roughly the midpoint between my initial offer of 400,000 and his offer of 550,000 (which I rejected). I am hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept this offer, considering that the money is worth 20% less with each passing round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Bob and let me know his response."
