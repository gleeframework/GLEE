"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of the original $6,000, or $4,800.

I don't think Bob's offer is very good for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 64% of the original $6,000, or $3,200. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Trying to find a middle ground, let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Trying to get closer to the middle 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 48.8% of the original $6,000, or $2,928. I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer.

Since Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 96.15% of the original $4,000, his gain of $5,200 is worth $5,000.

I think this offer is slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
