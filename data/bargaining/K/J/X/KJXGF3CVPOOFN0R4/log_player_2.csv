"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I factored in the inflation, let's close this deal."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:** It's crucial to recognize that the longer this negotiation drags on, the less the money is worth to both of us. However, the money loses value faster for me (10%) than for Alice (5%).
* **Balancing Fairness and Urgency:**  While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it slightly favored her due to the inflation difference. My counter-offer aims for a more balanced split that considers the inflation factor. 
* **Adding Pressure:** The message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement quickly (""let's close this deal""). This might make Alice more inclined to accept an offer slightly in my favor rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation loss for both of us, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:**  We're now in round 3, and the inflation has taken a noticeable bite. My potential gains have decreased by 19%, and even Alice's have dropped by almost 10%.
* **Shifting Dynamics:** Alice's offer, while still slightly in her favor, is now much closer to a true middle ground. It seems she's feeling the pressure of the inflation as well.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a significantly better offer in future rounds is increasingly risky. The longer we wait, the more the money devalues for both of us. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share, even if it's not the absolute maximum I could have aimed for initially."
