"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his proposal for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, my share of $50 is actually worth $47.50.

I'm not sure if Bob's share is worth more or less, since I don't know the effect of inflation on his side.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my share of $47.50 is now worth $44.88.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% this time. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. The message is a gentle reminder that I'm still open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more than last time, but let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my share of $80 is now worth $68.48.

I'll calculate the value of Bob's offer:
$60 is worth the same as in the first round, but since the total amount is now worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate it as a percentage of the current total.

The total amount is $100, and the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $86.18 in the first round. $60 is 69.59% of $86.18, so it's worth $59.87 in the first round. Considering the 14.26% decrease, Bob's share of $60 is now worth $51.71.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the reduced value of the money.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my share of $68.48 is now worth $58.71.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and keeping 55% for myself, which is $55. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm open to negotiations."
