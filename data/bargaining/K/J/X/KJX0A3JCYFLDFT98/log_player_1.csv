Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a 60/40 split, which seems fair considering the potential for inflation in future rounds.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the first round (he's offering me more), it's still not a fair split considering the inflation factor.  I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm increasing my share slightly from the first round, but still offering a fair split considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a reasonable compromise."
