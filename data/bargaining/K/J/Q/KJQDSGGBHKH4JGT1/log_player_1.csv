Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."

# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, especially since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I need 55 to make it worth my while""}
