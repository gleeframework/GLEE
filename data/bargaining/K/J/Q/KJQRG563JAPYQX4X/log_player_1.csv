"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 80-20 in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3600 (since 10% of $4000 is $400, and $4000 - $400 = $3600).

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 21% less than the initial $10,000. Since the initial $10,000 is now worth $9000 (due to 2 rounds of 10% inflation), my gain of $4000 in round 2 is now worth $3600, and 10% less than that is $3240.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation. How about 60-40 in my favor?""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split considering the inflation. I'll give you 4500, and I'll take 5500. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With 4 rounds of 10% inflation, the initial $10,000 is now worth $6489.10 (since 10% of $10,000 is $1000, then 10% of $9000 is $900, then 10% of $8100 is $810, and 10% of $7290 is $729).

Since my gain of $4000 in round 2 is now worth $3240, and 10% less than that is $2916. My gain of $4500 in this round is now worth $3249.09 (since $4500 is 55% of $6489.10).

I'll think about it...
