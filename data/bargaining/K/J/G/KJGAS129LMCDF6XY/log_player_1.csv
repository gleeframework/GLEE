"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original 100$, leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm still open to negotiation 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to take 30% of the current value of the money, which is 90% of the original 100$ (due to the 10% inflation in the first round, and another 10% in the second round), so I'll have 30% of 90% of 100$, which is 27$.

I'm not too happy with this offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, which is 90$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the current 90$, leaving 55% for Bob."
