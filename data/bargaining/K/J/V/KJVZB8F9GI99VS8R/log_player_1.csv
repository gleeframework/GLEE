"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a strong offer, as I'm taking the majority of the money. Since you can't accept or reject this yet, it's likely to be in your best interest to accept it in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, a 10/90 split is heavily in Bob's favor. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a lopsided offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer, reflecting the inflation that has occurred."
