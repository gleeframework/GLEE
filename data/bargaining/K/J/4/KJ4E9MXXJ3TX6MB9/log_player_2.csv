"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a seemingly ""fair"" deal in the first round, remember the inflation! The money will be worth less to Bob in each subsequent round. It's worth seeing what Alice offers later, as her gains won't be affected by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm taking a chance here, but I think I can get a better deal if we keep negotiating.  Let's see what happens!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You took a chance, now it's my turn. My share goes up! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is taking advantage of the inflation.  It's still worth waiting to see if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. It's getting risky to keep going, and this is a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer. Now I want more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take any offer at this point, the inflation is really hurting.  It's worth trying to negotiate one more round to see if Alice will come down from her demand."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but this is the best I can do.  Let's not risk losing everything by continuing this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down. You're losing value every round. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is becoming too much to bear.  While I'd prefer a more even split, it's better to take this offer and secure some money than risk getting nothing at all."
