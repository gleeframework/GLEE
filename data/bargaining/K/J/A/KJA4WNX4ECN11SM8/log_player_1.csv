Let's see if Bob is happy with this deal!  This gives me most of the money, but I'm willing to compromise if it means getting the deal done sooner.  I figure this is a good starting point given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible deal for me.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm losing a lot of money. It's time to see if I can get a better deal. I'll try to get Bob to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more this round.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that the longer we go, the less money we'll both end up with."
