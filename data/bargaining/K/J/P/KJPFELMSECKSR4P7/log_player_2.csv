"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""This offer accounts for the effect of inflation on our potential gains in the next round.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to consider the rapid inflation. If Alice rejects this offer, the money will be worth significantly less in the next round. 
* **Strategic Advantage:**  By offering slightly more than what Alice would get if she rejected this offer and proposed a 50/50 split in the next round, Bob increases his chances of acceptance while still securing a larger share.

This offer aims to be attractive enough for Alice to accept while acknowledging the time-sensitive nature of the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now the best possible outcome for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The money is rapidly losing value. Waiting another round means a much smaller potential gain, even if Bob could secure a slightly larger percentage.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is likely to offer even less in future rounds, knowing the pressure is on Bob due to the higher inflation rate he faces.

While not ideal, accepting this offer cuts Bob's losses and ensures he receives something rather than risking a worse outcome by waiting."
