"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think we can both get more if we negotiate a bit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than last round for both of us, considering the inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's a better deal than the previous round."
