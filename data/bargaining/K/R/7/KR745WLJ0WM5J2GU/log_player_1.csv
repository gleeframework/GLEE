"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more balanced split. This way, we both get a decent share while leaving room for further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 36 (60 - 20% of 60) and Bob's gain of 55 is actually worth 52.75 (40 - 5% of 40).

I'm not too thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to accept it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
