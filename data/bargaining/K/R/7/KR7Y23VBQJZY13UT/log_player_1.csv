"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll on my potential gain, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk losing more money by rejecting it. I'll accept this offer.
