**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her.  While her offers are slowly increasing, they are nowhere near a fair split given the circumstances.  My position is getting stronger each round.  I'm willing to push this close to the edge, knowing the fear of getting nothing will likely make her cave to a much better deal for me soon."

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offers have been more than fair.  Accept this now, or we both risk leaving with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 266920.625 
# Alice gain: 733079.375 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is cracking. She's shifted tactics from trying to reason to making threats. This indicates increasing desperation on her part. While her offer has improved, it's still far from an even split, and I'm willing to bet she'll break before I do. The risk is growing, but the potential reward of getting over 60% is too tempting to ignore."
