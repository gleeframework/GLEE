"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

Let's see... If Bob's offer is for 400,000, that's 40% of the current total, which is $800,000 (since it's 80% of the original $1,000,000 after one round of inflation).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems a bit low for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the current total, which is $560,000 (since it's 70% of the original $800,000 after two rounds of inflation)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We're losing money with every round! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

Let's see... If Bob's offer is for 500,000, that's 50% of the current total, which is $400,000 (since it's 50% of the original $800,000 after three rounds of inflation).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems a bit too even for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need to prioritize my gain.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the current total, which is $240,000 (since it's 60% of the original $400,000 after four rounds of inflation)."
