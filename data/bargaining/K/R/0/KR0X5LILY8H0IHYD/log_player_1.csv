"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split. I believe this is a fair and generous offer, giving Bob a decent starting point.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm confident that we can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept such a lopsided split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I propose a 5500/4500 split.  This is a more balanced offer, reflecting the value lost due to inflation.  I'm still willing to take a slight loss to reach an agreement, but I'm ready to be more firm in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to a more even split, I'm still not comfortable with this imbalance, especially with the continuing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable solution, acknowledging the significant inflation and recognizing the need for compromise.  Let's end this negotiation and avoid further losses."
