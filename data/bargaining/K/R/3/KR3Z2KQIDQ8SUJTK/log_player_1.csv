"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but 400,000 for me is too low. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! 45/55 split is a fair compromise""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not accepting Bob's offer again. The 300,000 for me is even lower than before, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic difference in our gains. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a larger share of the money. I'd like to propose a new offer and try to find a more balanced split."

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, where I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000. I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offer and Bob's previous offers, while also taking into account the effects of inflation."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not accepting Bob's offer again. The 250,000 for me is still too low, and I'm not willing to accept a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get an even larger share of the money. I'd like to propose a new offer and try to find a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, where I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000. I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offers and Bob's previous offers, while also taking into account the effects of inflation. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
