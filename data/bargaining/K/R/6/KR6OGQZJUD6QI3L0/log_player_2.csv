Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Every round we delay, the potential gains decrease for me. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
