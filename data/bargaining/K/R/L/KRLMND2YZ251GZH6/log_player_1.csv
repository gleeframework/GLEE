"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
