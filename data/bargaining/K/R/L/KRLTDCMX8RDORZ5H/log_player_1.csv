"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep $900,000 and give $100,000 to Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. Although my share is reduced due to inflation, I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round. I'll aim for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While the inflation has reduced my share from the previous round, this offer still provides a significant gain for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. While the inflation has hit us both,  I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I propose a 50/50 split.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that continuing to reject offers will only worsen the situation for both of us due to inflation."
