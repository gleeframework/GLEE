"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation impacts you more, but my offer is more equitable. Let's close the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is fair considering the inflation.  Let's settle this now before it gets any worse for me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now barely better than my offer in the previous round.  Given the inflation is only getting worse for her, it's unlikely she'll offer anything better. It's time to accept.
