Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution while still securing most of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation has eroded the value of my potential earnings significantly, and I don't want to risk further loss by rejecting and potentially going to another round.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome in this situation."
