"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer! Since inflation only affects Alice, Alice wants to secure the maximum amount of money possible in the first round. This leaves almost nothing for Bob, but it is the best strategy in the first round given the uncertainty about Bob's strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While inflation is a factor, it's important to consider that Bob could continue rejecting offers, and each round, the money will be worth less for Alice.  This offer at least guarantees half of the money for Alice, and that's a lot better than potentially getting even less in subsequent rounds."
