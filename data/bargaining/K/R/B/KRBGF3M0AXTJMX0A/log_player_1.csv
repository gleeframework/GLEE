"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and reasonable offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation.

My gain would be 400,000, but since it's worth 20% less, I'd actually get:

400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000

Bob's gain of 600,000 remains the same, but it's worth 100% of its original value.

After careful consideration, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my previous offer, still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this new offer and we can end the game before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment from my previous offer, still a fair deal! Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation.

My gain would be 450,000, but since it's worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%), I'd actually get:

450,000 * 0.512 = 230,400

Bob's gain of 550,000 remains the same, but it's worth 100% of its original value.

After careful consideration, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 51.2% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this new offer and we can end the game before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations, let's finalize! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 67.23% decrease in value due to inflation.

My gain would be 500,000, but since it's worth 32.77% of its original value (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%), I'd actually get:

500,000 * 0.3277 = 164,850

Bob's gain of 500,000 remains the same, but it's worth 100% of its original value.

After careful consideration, I'll:
