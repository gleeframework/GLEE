"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that offer! 10 dollars is too little, especially considering inflation. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a more fair split.  60 for me and 40 for Alice. This is a good starting point, and hopefully we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even split this round. Considering the inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the most fair solution at this point."
