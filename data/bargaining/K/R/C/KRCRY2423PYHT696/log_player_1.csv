"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep $90 for myself and give $10 to Bob. This way, I secure a good portion of the money in the first round, before inflation has a chance to significantly impact its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I gain a larger share of the money than in the first round, it's still significantly less than what I originally proposed.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose to keep $60 for myself and give $40 to Bob.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair split considering the inflation that has occurred.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and I'm no longer in a position to demand a larger share. A 50/50 split is the best I can hope for at this point."
