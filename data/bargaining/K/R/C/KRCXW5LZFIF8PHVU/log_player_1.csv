Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I think it's important to get the ball rolling and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, and the inflation is starting to take effect. It's in my best interest to accept before things get worse."
