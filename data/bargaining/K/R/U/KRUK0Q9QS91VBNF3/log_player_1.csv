"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll take the lead!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'll be the one making the proposal in the first round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than before, so the actual amount I'll get is 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

I'm not sure if 50/50 is a fair split, considering I've been the one making the proposal so far. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
