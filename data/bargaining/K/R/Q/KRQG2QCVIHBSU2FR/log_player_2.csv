Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the value of waiting for a potentially better offer is outweighed by the increasing losses due to inflation. Accepting Alice's offer, while not ideal, secures Bob a reasonable sum before inflation eats away further at his potential gains."
