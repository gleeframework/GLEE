  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I want to give him a larger share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
