"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also looking out for myself.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice is getting a much larger share of the money.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This is a fair and balanced split. Let's agree and move on."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this time I need more.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is now offering a significantly better deal than her initial offer, while her value is also decreasing due to inflation. This seems like a good compromise."
