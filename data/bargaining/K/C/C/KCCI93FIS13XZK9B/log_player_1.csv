"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose that I take $9000 and Bob takes $1000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small incentive to accept, but still leaves me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit to account for the inflation, but still keeping a significant portion. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept, as he's getting more than he did in his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even with inflation, I believe I can get more than $2000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm continuing to adjust my offer for inflation, but I believe this is still a fair deal. Bob is getting more than his previous offer, and I'm still getting a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  While the inflation is starting to hurt, I believe Bob is still more likely to accept a deal where I get at least 4000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of lowering my share slightly each round to account for inflation, while still offering Bob a fair share.  This offer should be attractive to him, and I'm hoping he'll finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept such a low offer.  While the inflation is significant, I believe Bob is likely to offer me more if I continue to hold out.  I'm confident I can get at least $5000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm still adjusting for inflation, but I'm also trying to be more aggressive with my offers. Bob is likely to get nervous as we get closer to the deadline, and I want to ensure he doesn't walk away with the majority of the money. This offer should be attractive to him while still giving me a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left, and the inflation hitting hard, it's time to be realistic.  I'm confident I can get more if we keep going, but the risk of getting nothing is too high. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point."
