"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'm inclined to accept this offer. The equal split seems fair, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting and going to the next round. 

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
