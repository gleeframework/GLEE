"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered a division of $10,000 where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey my intention of making a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a bit more. This offer accounts for the money losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, although the money is losing value, I believe I can get a better deal. With the inflation rates, Bob is losing more value than I am, so I think I have some leverage to negotiate further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is fair""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to $5,800 and decrease Bob's share to $4,200, considering the inflation rates. Since Bob is losing more value than I am, I believe this offer is reasonable. I've included a message explaining my reasoning, hoping Bob will understand and accept the offer. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We both lose if this goes on.  This is as high as I can go. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I think it's time to settle on a deal. Bob's message suggests that this is the highest offer they're willing to make, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer seems like the best decision at this point."
