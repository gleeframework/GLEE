"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves a reasonable amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly worse for me than my previous offer, and it's likely he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I will reject this offer and propose a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering a fair amount to Bob.  I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept before inflation eats away at his share too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6385 
# Bob gain: 3615 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has been hitting me hard, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is the best I've seen so far. I'm accepting it to avoid further losses from inflation."
