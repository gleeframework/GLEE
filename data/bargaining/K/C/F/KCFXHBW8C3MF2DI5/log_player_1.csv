Round 2

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but in his favor. I'll have to be careful with my decision.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money is worth significantly less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is the same as my previous offer. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get.
