"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept my offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept or reject my offer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no inflation this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering Bob's offer to split it evenly, I will accept this offer. It seems like a fair deal, especially since I was trying to persuade Bob with a similar message in the first round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
