"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. Let me know if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 75/25 split is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor. The next round will see the money worth 20% less for me, and I can make a counter-proposal.  It's worth risking a round to potentially get a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
