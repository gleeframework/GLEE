"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You offered 20, I'll give you 40, now it's your turn to compromise""
}
```"
