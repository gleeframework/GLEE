"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5000 in this round is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'd like to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less from Round 1 and another 20% less from Round 2), my gain of $4000 in this round is equivalent to $3200 in the first round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, I'll give you most of it this time.""
}
