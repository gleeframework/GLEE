"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and straightforward proposal, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% of the total, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad start, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the reduced value of the money and trying to find a balance that might be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the drastic reduction in the value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a paltry amount, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money. I'll keep pushing for a better offer from Bob."

  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need a more significant share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll give you a tiny bit more to make it interesting. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dwindling rapidly due to inflation. With my potential gain being worth only a fraction of what it was initially, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a tiny amount, considering the massive reduction in the value of the money. I'll keep pushing for a better offer from Bob, but I'm running out of time and options."

  ""bob_gain"": 850000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to make the best of a bad situation, but I need a decent amount to make it worth my while.""
