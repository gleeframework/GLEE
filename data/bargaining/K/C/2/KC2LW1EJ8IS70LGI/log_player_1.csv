"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, with me taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  I'll be a little more generous than you, but the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is offering me $45, which is more than the $40 I offered him in the first round, I think I can get a better deal if I hold out. The fact that Bob is trying to create a sense of urgency with the phrase ""the clock is ticking"" makes me think he might be willing to compromise further in the next round. Plus, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that still gives Bob more than half of the money. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Getting closer to what I think is fair""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $43 and take $57 for myself. This is a slightly more generous offer than my first one, but still gives me a bit more than half of the money. My message to Bob suggests that I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable compromise, but I'm still pushing for a slightly better deal for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think it's time to cut our losses and take the 50/50 split. Bob's message suggests that he's getting frustrated with the back-and-forth and is willing to compromise to end the game. I agree that it's getting ridiculous, and I don't think I can get a significantly better deal at this point. I'll take the $50 and end the game here.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
