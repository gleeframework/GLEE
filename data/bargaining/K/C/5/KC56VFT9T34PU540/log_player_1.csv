"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I need to adjust my expectations. In this round, I'd be getting 65% of the new, reduced value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
