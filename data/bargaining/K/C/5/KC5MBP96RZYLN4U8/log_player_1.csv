"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and my message to Bob is to set a fair and equal tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider the new values.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $45 is still 45% of the total.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Since the money is worth 0.95 (1 - 0.05) of its original value, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decrease.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself this round""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to make up for the loss due to inflation by offering a slightly higher share for myself this round 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, Bob's gain is worth even less than before. I'll need to reassess the value of his offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $48 is 48% of the total.

However, I'm still not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get, considering the rapid inflation. I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the accelerating inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of money.

Since the money is worth 0.85 (1 - 0.05 - 0.1426) of its original value, I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the increased inflation.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 55,

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $42 is 42% of the total.

However, I'm still not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get, considering the rapid inflation. I'd like to push for a higher share, but I'm willing to compromise.

Since the money is worth 0.77 (1 - 0.05 - 0.1426 - 0.2262) of its original value, I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the extreme inflation.
