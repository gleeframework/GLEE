"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle quickly due to the higher inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself. The inflation is a significant factor, but I can't just accept the first offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both face inflation, but a fair split seems like the best solution for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us, but especially for you. I'm willing to be slightly more generous this round, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still would prefer an even split, the inflation is hitting me hard. Alice's offer is the best I've seen so far, and with each passing round my gains are decreasing more rapidly. It's time to settle."
