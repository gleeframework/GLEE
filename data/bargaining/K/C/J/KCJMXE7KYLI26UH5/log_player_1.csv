"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer, but not so generous that I'm giving away too much. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should switch it up this round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the offer of 40 dollars, especially since it's now worth 10% less than it was in the first round. I think I can do better than that, so I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nSince Bob's offer was the opposite of mine, I'm guessing he wants to meet somewhere in the middle. I'll offer him 45 dollars, which is closer to the middle than my previous offer. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is a suggestion that we compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Hopefully, Bob will see it that way and accept the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this.  My turn to propose the middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but considering the inflation, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round and losing even more value. Bob's message suggests that he's trying to find a compromise, and I think this is a reasonable middle ground. Let's settle this and take the 45 dollars!\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
