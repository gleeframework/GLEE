"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but  65/35 is the best I can do. Remember, the longer we go on, the less the money is worth for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still pushing for a heavily weighted split in her favor. While her offer has improved, it's crucial to demonstrate I won't be swayed by intimidation tactics or the fear of inflation. By rejecting this offer, I signal my willingness to play the long game and aim for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing you're serious about finding a compromise. Let's make this round the last one. I propose a 55/45 split â€“ it acknowledges my initial advantage while still giving you a significant share.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We need to start pushing towards an agreement. This offer:

* **Shows Flexibility:**  I'm moving closer to a middle ground, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlights the Time Factor:**  The message subtly reminds Alice that further delays benefit neither of us due to inflation.
* **Aims for a Strong Position:** Getting a slight advantage now is crucial, as the later rounds heavily favor Alice due to the differential inflation rates."
