"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. A little more than half seems reasonable for the first round, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems generous at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation. Accepting now means I lose out on potential gains in future rounds if I can convince Alice to agree to a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I'm feeling the inflation pinch already.  Let's make a deal now and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to find a balance. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's still not enough to offset the impact of inflation. I need to hold out a bit longer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  This is my final offer for a significant amount. Let's close the deal now!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is holding firm, and the inflation rate is becoming increasingly detrimental. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to the later rounds."
