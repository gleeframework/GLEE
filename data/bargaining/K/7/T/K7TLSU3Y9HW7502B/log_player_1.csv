"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the 30 dollars I would gain in this round is worth less than the 60 dollars I would have gained in the first round. I'm willing to accept this offer to get some money now rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds.
