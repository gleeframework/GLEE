"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the initial 100 dollars. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is 20% of the initial 100 dollars. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would gain is 50 * 0.95 = 47.50.

I accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
