"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose to take 95 dollars and leave 5 dollars for Bob. This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount, but I still get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject the offer. While it's a significant gain for me, the inflation factor makes it less appealing. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob. This is a compromise, offering a significant increase from the previous round, but still ensuring I get a majority share.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's an even split, and continuing to reject offers could lead to me getting even less in future rounds."
