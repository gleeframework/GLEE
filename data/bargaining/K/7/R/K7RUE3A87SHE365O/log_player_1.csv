"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I get to propose first, I'm going to try to secure a good chunk of the money.  Hopefully, Bob won't be too greedy and will accept this offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much worse than what I initially proposed. It's worth 10% less to me due to inflation.  Even though Bob's offer is worth slightly less to him, I think he will accept it in the next round since the money will be worth even less after that. It's time to be patient and wait for a better opportunity."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to propose a new offer: 810,000 for me and 190,000 for Bob. Since I get to propose again, I'm going to try to improve my position a little bit while also acknowledging the inflation and potential for Bob to make a counter-offer.  I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm trying to be a bit more realistic in my proposal. Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible! Even though it's worth 14.26% less to him due to inflation, it's worth 27.1% less to me. It's a huge drop from my previous proposals, and I'm not willing to accept such a bad deal. I'm going to reject this offer and hope for a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

This is my last chance to propose a deal. I'm going to offer 729,000 for me and 271,000 for Bob.  This is a big reduction from my previous offers, but it's the best I can do given the inflation and Bob's increasingly aggressive stance. I hope he sees the value in this offer and agrees to it before the money becomes even less valuable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  The money is worth so much less now due to inflation, and I'm afraid that if I reject this offer, I'll end up with nothing in the next round.  While it's a significant drop from what I initially wanted, it's better than getting nothing at all."
