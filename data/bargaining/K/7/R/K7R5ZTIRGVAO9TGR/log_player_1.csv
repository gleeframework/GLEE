Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'll try again. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although this offer is heavily in Bob's favor, it's the best I can realistically hope for at this point.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (48.8% decrease already!). Every round that passes significantly hurts my potential gains.
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob knows time is on his side. He's likely to offer even less in future rounds. 

Taking the $400,000 now is a better outcome than risking getting an even smaller amount later, or even reaching a point where the entire sum becomes almost worthless due to inflation."
