"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of proposing first.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more for waiting for your proposal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 300000
Bob gain: 665000

I'll accept Bob's offer.
