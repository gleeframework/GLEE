This is a tough one!  While I'd prefer a better split, here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the value is plummeting. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount.
* **Downward Trend:**  Bob's offers have been getting worse from my perspective. There's a chance he won't budge further, and we'll both lose. 

It's a gamble, but waiting might lead to an even worse outcome."
