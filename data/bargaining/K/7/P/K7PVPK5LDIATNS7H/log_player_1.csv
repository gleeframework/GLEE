"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm coming down 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, let's try this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
