"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping this will set a reasonable tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer, I'm not as enthusiastic about it as I was initially.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to counter with a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 52/48 is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer even further, I'm not convinced that 52/48 is a fair split. I'd like to hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to make a new offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the remaining value. Since Bob's offer was 52/48, I'll try to get a bit more than that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 530000,
  ""bob_gain"": 470000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced 52/48 is fair, Bob. I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's try 53/47.""
}
