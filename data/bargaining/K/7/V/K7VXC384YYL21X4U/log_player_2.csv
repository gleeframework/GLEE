Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation concerns, Bob, so I'm coming up a bit. This offer still gives me a slight edge, but it's a better deal for you than last round considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice has come up a bit, I still think the split is not fair considering the inflation. The money is worth less now, and I believe we can find a better division. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's move on to Round 4. I'm ready to make another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It acknowledges the inflation while still giving me a slight advantage. We need to reach an agreement soon before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of money due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept this offer.
