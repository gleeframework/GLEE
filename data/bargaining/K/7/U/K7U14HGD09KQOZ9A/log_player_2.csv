"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats into your share! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to let Alice take advantage of me!  While this offer might seem tempting, I know that waiting just one round will mean I can get a much better deal.  After all, I'm losing 10% with every round!  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm willing to take a bit less than half, but I need a more reasonable share than the last offer.  We both lose with each round, so let's find a solution that works for us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob, and every tick costs you. This is my final offer - let's be realistic and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm losing value rapidly with each passing round.  It's better to take this deal and at least secure a decent share.  I'm not going to risk another round and end up with even less."
