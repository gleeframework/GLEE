Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm willing to take a bit less than half, but I need a more reasonable share than the last offer.  We both lose with each round, so let's find a solution that works for us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
