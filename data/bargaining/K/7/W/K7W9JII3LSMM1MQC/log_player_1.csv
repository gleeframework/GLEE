"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain in this round is worth 80% of the original $4000, which is $3200.

I'll reject this offer, since I'd rather have the full $4000. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my offer will be worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80% = 64%).

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 3200, ""bob_gain"": 6800}"
