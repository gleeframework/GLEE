"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 55/45 split. I'd like to propose a 50/50 split and see if you accept.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the second round). I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be generous, Bob. Let's accept this 75/25 split and move on.""
}
```"
