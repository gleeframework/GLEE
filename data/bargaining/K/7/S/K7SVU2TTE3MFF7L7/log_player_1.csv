"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $500,000 I would get is now worth only 80% of its original value, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an even split, considering I could get more if I negotiate further. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal for you!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to give him a decent amount."
