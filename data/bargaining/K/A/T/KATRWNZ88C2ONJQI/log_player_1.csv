"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting my role in rejecting your first offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's revised offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining $100, which is $32.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll do 50/50, it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which would give me $50 and Bob $50. Let's see if Bob will accept this revised offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 55% and you can have 45%""}

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the original 50/50 split, but still gives me a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
