Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This way I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets something.  It's a fair starting point, and hopefully, he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I propose that I receive $810,000 and Bob receives $190,000.  While the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'm still willing to offer Bob a significant share to try and reach an agreement."
