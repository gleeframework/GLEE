Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid a larger loss later, but I'd like to get a slightly larger portion than you're offering.
