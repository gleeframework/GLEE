"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split.""}\n\n###\nI've made my offer. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject it. Keep in mind that with each passing round, the money's value decreases due to inflation. I've taken that into consideration with my proposal. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's better for you to take it now before inflation eats away more of your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the impact of inflation and Alice's message that this is her final offer, I've decided to accept her proposal. The decreasing value of the money with each round makes it prudent to secure the offered amount now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
