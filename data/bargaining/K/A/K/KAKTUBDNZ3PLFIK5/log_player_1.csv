"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. This is a 80-20 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob, I see.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting me more, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous either""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75-25 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob, but I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a better offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 72-28 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money."
