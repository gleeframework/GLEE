"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll think about it.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. I'll offer a 55/45 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A 55/45 split is a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth a lot less, I'll think about it.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 52/48 in his favor, and my previous offer was 55/45 in my favor, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll offer a 53/47 split.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 53/47 seems reasonable""
