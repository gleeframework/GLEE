Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to something more agreeable, Alice is still overestimating the value of her share due to the inflation working against her.  There's a good chance she'll be more desperate in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on for both sides.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice's share is rapidly losing value. While she's been stubbornly holding out for a larger portion, the reality of the situation should be setting in. 
* **Clean and Fair:** Offering a 50/50 split is straightforward and demonstrates a willingness to compromise. This could be more appealing to Alice now that the stakes are higher."
