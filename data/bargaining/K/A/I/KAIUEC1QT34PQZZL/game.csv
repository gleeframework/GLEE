900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust from there if you'd like.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,Let's be more even. I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. We can adjust from here if you'd prefer.,Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's try a 60/40 split.  This gives you a good chunk of the money, and it's a fairer deal than the last round. Let's make this happen.",Alice,3,
