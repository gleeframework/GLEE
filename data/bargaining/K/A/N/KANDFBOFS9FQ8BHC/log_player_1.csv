"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. While he's offering me a slightly higher amount than the initial 50/50 split, I'm still getting a smaller share. I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable and willing to compromise."
