"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer to divide the $100, taking into account the need for a reasonable split to encourage acceptance but also considering the impact of inflation in subsequent rounds.
Given that there are 12 rounds and the money decreases in value by 10% each round, it's strategic to start with an offer that is somewhat balanced but still favorable to me, Alice, to leave room for negotiation.

### Step 2: Calculate the exact amounts for the proposal.
I'll propose a division where I, Alice, receive $60, and Bob receives $40. This split is somewhat biased towards me but is reasonable enough that Bob might consider it, especially given the looming threat of inflation reducing the value of the money in subsequent rounds.

### Step 3: Formulate a concise message to accompany the proposal.
The message should convey a sense of fairness and the strategic advantage of accepting the offer early, considering the inflation factor. A suitable message could be: ""Accept this fair offer now and avoid losing value to inflation.""

### Step 4: Package the proposal and message into the required JSON format.
The offer and message need to be formatted as specified for transmission to Bob.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair offer now and avoid losing value to inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good deal and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer in the context of the game's current state.
Bob has offered an even split of $50 each. Given that we are in the second round and the money's value has decreased by 10%, an even split at this point might be seen as a reasonable offer.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on future offers.
The total value of the money has decreased to $90 due to the 10% inflation in the first round. Thus, an even split now means each of us gets $45 in original value terms, but because of the reduced value, we're actually getting less.

### Step 3: Decide whether to accept the offer or reject it based on strategic considerations.
Given that there are 10 rounds left and the money's value will continue to decrease, accepting an even split now might be more advantageous than risking further devaluation. However, strategically, since I initially proposed a split in my favor and Bob has countered with an even split, I might consider the possibility of negotiating further, given the early stage of the game.

### Step 4: Make a decision based on the evaluation.
Despite the strategic considerations for further negotiation, the risk of significant loss due to inflation in subsequent rounds makes accepting this offer a reasonable choice.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
