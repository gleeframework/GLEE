"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 10% less, so the total amount is now $90.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I think it's a reasonable offer given the circumstances. I'll accept it.
