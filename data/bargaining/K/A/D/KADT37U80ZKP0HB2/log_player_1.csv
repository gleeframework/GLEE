"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think Bob's offer is a relatively good one. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the risk of rejecting it and going to the next round is that the money will be worth even less.
