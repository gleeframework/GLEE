"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going to try to get as much as possible.  I'm only offering Bob $1, but I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, taking 1000 is better than nothing.  The inflation is a serious threat and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's better to take what I can get now."
