I'm proposing that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  This is a pretty high offer for me, but it's the best I can do in the first round to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take this deal than risk getting even less in future rounds. The inflation on Bob's side is working in my favor, and this offer is still more than I would get in the next round."
