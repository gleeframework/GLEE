"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's offer is 4000, that's equivalent to 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 in the first round's value.

And since Bob's gain is worth 20% less, and Bob's offer is 6000, that's equivalent to 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
