"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get the larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer considering we're starting with $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll compare the values accordingly.

My gain of 6000 in the first round is still worth 6000, but Bob's gain of 4000 is now worth 3800 (since it's 5% less). 

Bob's new offer is 4750 for me and 5250 for him, which is a higher value for me than my original gain of 6000. I'll accept this offer.
