"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($900,000), but I'm willing to give Bob a small share to encourage him to accept.  It's a good starting point to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though my gain is significantly lower than Bob's, it's still worth more than what I would get if we keep playing.  Inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, but I can still hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 700,000, but still offering Bob a significant share. Inflation is hitting me hard, so I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and avoiding further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I can still earn more if we continue playing, even though the value of the money is decreasing quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a compromise.  I'm reducing my own gain to try and reach a middle ground, knowing that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting me hard now.  Although the offer is still less than what I initially wanted, I'm taking it.  I'm losing a lot of money each round, and if I keep rejecting offers, I risk getting nothing.  I need to accept this to minimize my losses."
