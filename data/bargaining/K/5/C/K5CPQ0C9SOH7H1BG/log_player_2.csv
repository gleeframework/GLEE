Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the need for fairness, but I'm making a bigger concession considering the inflation impact on you. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame the offer as generous, but it's important to stay focused on the numbers and the remaining rounds. While the impact of inflation is growing, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate a better split. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of money on the table."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting you more each round. This offer is a good balance considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that inflation is working against me, her offer is still tilting heavily in her favor. The key is to remain calm and not give in to the pressure.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significantly smaller share."
