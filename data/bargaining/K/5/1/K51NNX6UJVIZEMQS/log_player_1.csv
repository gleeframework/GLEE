"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think an even split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that an even split is the fairest way to start, especially since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation. I'd like to propose an alternative offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to account for the inflation, but I think this is a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting 5,500 and Bob getting 4,500."
