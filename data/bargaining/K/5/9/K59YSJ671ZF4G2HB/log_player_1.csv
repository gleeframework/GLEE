"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leaving 30 dollars for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain being worth 10% less, I need to consider the value of the money more carefully.

In this case, I'll reject Bob's offer because I think I deserve more than 20 dollars, considering the inflation and the initial offer I made. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous rounds and the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 80 for him and 20 for me, I'll try to get a better share. I'll offer a bit more than 20 dollars, but not too much, since I don't know how much Bob values the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""A slight improvement from my previous offer, still fair?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider the value of the money more carefully.

However, I notice that Bob's gain in this offer is even higher than in the previous round (85 vs 80), and the message suggests that he's getting more desperate. I think I should take advantage of this and try to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for a better one.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous rounds and the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 85 for him and 15 for me, I'll try to get a better share. I'll offer a bit more than 15 dollars, but not too much, since I don't know how much Bob values the money.

I'll also try to be a bit more aggressive in my offer, given that Bob's gain is decreasing with each round.

  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
