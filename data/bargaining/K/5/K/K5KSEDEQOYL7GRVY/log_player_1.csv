"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise.  This is a little closer to even, but time is ticking.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go back to my previous offer. Even split is the fairest, and we're losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse offer from Bob later, especially considering the inflation working against him. It's a compromise to avoid losing out entirely."
