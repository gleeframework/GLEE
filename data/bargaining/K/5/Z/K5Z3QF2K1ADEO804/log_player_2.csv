"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There's no downside to rejecting since the inflation only affects me if I accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This compensates for the previous round's rejection and maintains fairness. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. Even though it's a better deal for me than the previous round, I still want to see if I can get closer to a 70/30 split. I'm hoping Alice will feel pressured to accept a deal where I gain more, as the rounds continue."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
