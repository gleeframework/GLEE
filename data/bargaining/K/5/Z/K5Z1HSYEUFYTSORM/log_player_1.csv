"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While this might seem aggressive, it's important to remember that the money is worth less with each round.  This gives Bob a chance to get something, and leaves me with the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Even though my share is smaller, it's still better than risking losing it all.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is more favorable to him, but still gives me a significant sum.
* **Future Rounds:**  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is high.

It's a strategic decision to take what I can get now before things get worse."
