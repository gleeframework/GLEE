"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal early and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation hurts my gains significantly, accepting this offer guarantees me a good portion of the money. It's better to secure half now than risk getting nothing in later rounds due to further inflation."
