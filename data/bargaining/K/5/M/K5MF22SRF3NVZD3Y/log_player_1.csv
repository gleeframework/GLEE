"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40 for me and 60 for him, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split this time, but I'm open to negotiations!"
