Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation, and we both need to feel good about the outcome. 55/45 seems fair considering time is on my side. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Explanation: 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob due to the impact of inflation. 

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for Bob. Accepting $45 now is better than risking a worse offer from Alice in later rounds where the value will decrease even further.
* **Alice's position:** Alice knows time is on her side and is unlikely to offer more. She started with a favorable offer (60/40) and is now at 55/45. Waiting further risks her moving closer to an even split, which is disadvantageous for Bob.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and cut his losses from the impact of inflation.
