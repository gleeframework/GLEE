"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, given that Bob's money will be worth slightly less than mine with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option for me. Given the inflation, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
