"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, Alice! A fair split, but with a slight edge for me 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain of $50 is actually $45 in real value.

I accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
