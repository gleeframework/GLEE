Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 48/52. This is still a fair deal considering inflation is starting to kick in. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
