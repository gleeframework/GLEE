Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
