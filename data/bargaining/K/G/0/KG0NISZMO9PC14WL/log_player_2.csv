"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a 60/40 split. I believe this is a fair offer to begin with.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I think we can find something a bit more balanced. How about a 55/45 split?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your point of view. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? It seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
 
Even though it's slightly worse than my offer, accepting now avoids further risk of inflation eroding the amount."
