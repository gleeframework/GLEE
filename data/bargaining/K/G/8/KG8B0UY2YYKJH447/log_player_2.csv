Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be reasonable, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle this time, or we'll both lose more with each round. 
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players, but especially for Alice. This makes her increasingly likely to accept a less favorable deal as time runs out.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the potential gains shrink. Waiting longer is riskier as it brings the possibility of getting nothing.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Alice's offer is moving closer to a more even split. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas holding out for 60/40 might backfire.

By Round 5, the risk of getting nothing outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly better deal in later rounds."
