"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  It's early in the game, and I can likely get a better deal by rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'm giving you a good chunk, but I need a bigger share for myself.  This game is about maximizing our gains, and I believe this offer is a good start.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share than your last offer.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is offering a decent amount, and with the inflation, I'm starting to feel the pressure.  Accepting this offer is a good way to secure a good chunk of the money before things get worse."
