"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, as I want to maximize my share of the money. Since the value of the money decreases faster for Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer and while I would have preferred a larger share, the risk of losing money due to inflation makes this the best option."
