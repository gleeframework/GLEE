"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. You can try to do better next round if you want. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider whether the difference is worth it.

I'll decide to reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money I gained in the first round still worth the same, and the money I could have gained in the second round worth 10% less, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for it. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm hoping to make up for the losses in the next round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal yet. You can try to do better next round if you want. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gained in the first round still worth the same, and the money Bob gains worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider the relative values. Since Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation, I should be willing to accept a slightly lower share.

I'll decide to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
