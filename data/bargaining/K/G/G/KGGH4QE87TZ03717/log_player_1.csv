# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is not what I was hoping for, but considering the significant impact of inflation, I think it's time to accept and secure a deal. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I risk losing everything if we can't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds. So, I'll accept Bob's offer.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
