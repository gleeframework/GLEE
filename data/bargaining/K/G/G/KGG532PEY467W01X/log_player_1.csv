"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'm keeping the rest for myself. The message is a bit of a warning to Bob that this is a good deal, and he should consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting 720,000 dollars if I accept Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
