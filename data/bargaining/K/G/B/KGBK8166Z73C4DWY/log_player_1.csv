Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation to eat into the value of the money over time. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the $10,000 now than risk getting nothing if we keep going.  Even with inflation, $10,000 is better than $0."
