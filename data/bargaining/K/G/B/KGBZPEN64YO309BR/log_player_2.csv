"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this time, but I'm sure you'll get a better deal in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, with inflation, the money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I'd rather try to get more now.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'm excited to make a counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. We both get an equal share, and we can walk away happy.""}\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in this offer and accept it. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'd rather settle for a fair deal now than risk losing more value in future rounds. Fingers crossed!"
