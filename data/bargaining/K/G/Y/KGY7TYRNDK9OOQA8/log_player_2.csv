"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with an even split, considering the inflation affects Alice more than me. I want to try to get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation difference between us. Since Alice is affected more by inflation, I'll try to get a bit more than half, but still offer her a substantial amount to consider accepting.

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise.  Let's split it closer to your offer. But we need to wrap this up, inflation is hurting me! 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nStill not good enough. Given the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gain, I think I can push for a better deal. Her gain is now worth 36% less, which puts more pressure on her to settle.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gain, I'll try to negotiate a bit more aggressively while still being somewhat reasonable. Since her gain is now worth significantly less, she might be more inclined to accept a deal that's less favorable to her but still better than prolonging the game.

{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Inflation is indeed a factor, let's settle this before it gets worse for you.""}"
