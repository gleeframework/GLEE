"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share, but still a reasonable offer for Bob. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not take a smaller share, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need to be more aggressive due to inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not take a smaller share, especially since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I need to be more aggressive, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, giving Bob a larger share, but trying to maximize my gain in this round."
