Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting point, but I'm keeping in mind the inflation rates and how they might influence Bob's decisions in later rounds.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I prefer more for myself, the inflation rates are starting to take effect. Accepting a 50/50 split now is a good move to secure some money before it's worth even less!"
