"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $500,000 and Bob would get $500,000."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small chunk, but I'm holding out for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, as I'm only getting 20% of the original amount, and Bob is keeping 80%. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my goal, but I'm still willing to compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the original amount. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again in the next round."
