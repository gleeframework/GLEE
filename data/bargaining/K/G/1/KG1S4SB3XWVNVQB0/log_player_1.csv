"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 45-55 split. I'd rather aim for a better share considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing, I'll aim for a slightly better share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 for now.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
