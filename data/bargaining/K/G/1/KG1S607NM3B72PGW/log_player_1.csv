I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than the previous round, I still believe I can get a better deal."

I'm going to offer Bob slightly more this round, but still keep a larger share for myself. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. The inflation is really starting to bite, and while I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
