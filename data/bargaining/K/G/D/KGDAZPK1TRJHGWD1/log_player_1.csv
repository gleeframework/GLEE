I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  This is a generous offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I offer to take 850,000 dollars, and give Bob 150,000 dollars.  While Bob's offer in the last round was tempting, I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal.  Considering the inflation rate, I believe this is a reasonable compromise."
