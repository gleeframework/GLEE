"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, but with a slightly better offer for me 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the new offer, I'll be getting $5,000, which is 50% of the total.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
