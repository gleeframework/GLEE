"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, I'll take 90% and you get 10% 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, waiting a few rounds will significantly increase the potential gains, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, a 60/40 split seems fair. Don't push your luck.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is my final offer.  The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing tough, but that offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  With the inflation working against Bob more than Alice, holding out a little longer is risky, but there's still a chance for a much better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be realistic. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
```"
