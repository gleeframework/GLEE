I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and the money is already losing value.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
