"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I gain 400,000 dollars, which is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob gains 600,000 dollars, which is 10% less than his original gain of 666,667 dollars (600,000 / 0.9 = 666,667), I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for 400,000, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair deal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of Bob's gain in the first round, which is 666,667 dollars. Due to inflation, Bob's gain of 520,000 dollars in this round is worth 46.9% of his original gain (520,000 / 1,111,111 = 0.469). This is less than my gain of 480,000 dollars, which is worth the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Since Bob's offer was for 520,000, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think this is the best I can do. Your turn!""
}
```

This offer is very close to Bob's previous offer, but I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
