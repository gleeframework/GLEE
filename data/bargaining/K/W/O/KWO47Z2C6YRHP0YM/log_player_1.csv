"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you 40% of the money, but I'm keeping 60% for myself. It's a better deal than 50/50, and the money will be worth less in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I think I can do better. The money is worth less in future rounds, but I'd like to get a bigger share now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a better deal, I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal in this round. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% now, it's a good compromise before the money loses more value""
}
```"
