"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving me 60% of the initial $10,000, but it's still a decent split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3200. Bob's gain of $6000 remains the same.

I'll accept this offer.
