"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

In the first round, I proposed a gain of 60, which is worth $60. In the second round, the money is worth 90% of that, so my gain would be $54.

Bob's offer in the second round is 50, which is worth $45.

I'm not sure if I should accept or reject this offer. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, my gain in this round is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage.

I'll propose a 70-30 split, which is a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, 70-30 is the new offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still a bit too lopsided, but I'll give you a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to bite!

In the first round, my gain was worth $60. After four rounds of inflation, my gain is worth 0.271 * $60 = $16.26.

Bob's offer in the fourth round is 55, which is worth $4.38.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's getting increasingly difficult to make ends meet. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. In the first round, my gain was worth $60, and after five rounds of inflation, it's worth 0.271^5 * $60 = $1.43.

With that in mind, I'll propose a very aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal before it's too late.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or leave it! 80-20, I'm not budging!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, let's find a fair middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential gains. In the first round, my gain was worth $60, and after six rounds of inflation, it's worth 0.596 * $60 = $35.76.

Bob's offer in the sixth round is 60, which is worth $21.46.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's getting increasingly difficult to say no. I'll have to weigh my options carefully...
