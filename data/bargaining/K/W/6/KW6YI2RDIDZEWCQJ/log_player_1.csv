I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves a significant portion for Bob. This should give him some incentive to accept, while still ensuring a good outcome for me.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even though it's less than my initial proposal.  It's a gamble to keep going, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
