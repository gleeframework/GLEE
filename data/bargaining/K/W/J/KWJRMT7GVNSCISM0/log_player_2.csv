Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's cut the losses and split it evenly. Inflation is hurting us both, and a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to avoid further arguing. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
