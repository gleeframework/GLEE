"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight advantage this time, 52/48.  I think it's a fair compromise since we both have to consider the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
