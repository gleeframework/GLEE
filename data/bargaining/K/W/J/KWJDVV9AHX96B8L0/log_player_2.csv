"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. Alice is right about the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the sentiment Bob, but I need a bit more to account for the shrinking pot. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is pushing her luck.  I'm willing to be fair, but she needs to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and the money is shrinking. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth helps no one. I'm offering a slight adjustment - let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is not ideal, but it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in the end. The inflation is significantly impacting Alice's potential gains, and she might not be willing to budge much further.  Let's close the deal."
