"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 3800$ in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 40/60 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, my offer will be worth 5% less than in the second round. Let's see...

My gain of 3800$ in the second round is worth 0.95 * 3800 = 3610$ in the third round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the first round, considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial value: 3800$ (from round 2)
Inflation: 5% in round 2, 5% in round 3, and 5% in round 4
Total inflation: 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.152625
Value in round 4: 3800 * 1.152625 = 4385.25

Now, let's compare Bob's offer:

My gain of 3000$ in round 4 is worth 4385.25$ in the first round.
Bob's gain of 7000$ is worth 7000$ in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 30/70 split, especially considering my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let's calculate the value of my gain in the first round, considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial value: 3610$ (from round 3)
Inflation: 5% in round 3, 5% in round 4
Total inflation: 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025
Value in round 5: 3610 * 1.1025 = 3973.675

Now, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a fair deal!""
}
