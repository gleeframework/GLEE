"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a decent share, but keeping a slight majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. I'm sure we can both agree that's fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation rate. If we split it evenly now, I'd be giving up more than 50% of my share in real terms. Can you do better?""
}
```

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation rate and trying to maximize my gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round. But I'll still take the lead, and you'll get a decent 45% of the money. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is starting to hurt. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than before, but I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite different from his previous one. I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm surprised you're willing to give me a smaller share now, but I'm not sure I want to give you 60% of the money. I think I can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle at 55%?""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm trying to find a compromise that works for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the inflation rate and trying to maximize my gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I should get the majority. I'll give you 58% of the money, and I'll take the rest. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation rate.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
