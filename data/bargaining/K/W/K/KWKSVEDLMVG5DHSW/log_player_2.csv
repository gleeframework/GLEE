Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split considering the inflation. This offer benefits us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  It's crucial to recognize that delaying an agreement makes the money less valuable, especially for Bob who faces a 20% inflation rate. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Alice's offer, we signal that we're not settling for an unfair deal. This puts pressure on Alice to make a more reasonable offer in the next round if she wants to avoid further devaluation.
* **The Offer:** The proposed split of $5600 for Bob and $4400 for Alice aims to find a middle ground. While it leans in Bob's favor, it's important to remember that Alice's inflation rate is lower, making her potential losses in future rounds less significant. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing Bob's potential gain and securing an agreement before inflation significantly erodes the value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is rapidly losing value.  A 36% decrease in value for Bob is significant, making the current offer more appealing than it might have seemed in earlier rounds.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice's offer indicates a willingness to compromise. While it still favors her, it's a noticeable shift from her initial proposal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice proposing an even less favorable split in the next round, where the value will be further diminished by inflation.

Accepting this offer ensures Bob receives a reasonable portion of the money while mitigating the negative impact of continued inflation."
