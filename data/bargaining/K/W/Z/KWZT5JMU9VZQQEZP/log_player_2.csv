Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice offered 25 in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money!

I'll think carefully... Since Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and I'm not sure what her next offer will be, I'll accept this one.
