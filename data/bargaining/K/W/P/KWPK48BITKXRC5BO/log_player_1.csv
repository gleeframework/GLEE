"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is a good starting point. We can talk about adjustments later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth $45.

I'm willing to accept Bob's 50/50 offer for now. It's a reasonable starting point, and we can reassess later if needed.
