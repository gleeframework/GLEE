"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. If I accept this offer, I'll get $100,000, which is worth 95% of the original $500,000 I proposed in Round 1. That's a significant reduction due to inflation.

However, if I reject this offer and proceed to Round 3, the money I gain will be worth only 90% of the original amount, and it'll be even harder to negotiate a better deal.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90% of the original amount, so I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to negotiate in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money I gain is worth 85.74% of the original amount, which is a significant reduction due to inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 85.74% of the original $500,000 I proposed in Round 1. This is a relatively small share, but I'm running out of rounds and need to be cautious about inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be satisfied with his share and we can finalize the deal.
