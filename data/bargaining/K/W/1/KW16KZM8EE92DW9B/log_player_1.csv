This is a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a favorable deal while still leaving enough for Bob to potentially accept.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to impact my potential gains significantly. This offer still gives me a decent amount and accepting now avoids the risk of getting an even worse deal in the next round."
