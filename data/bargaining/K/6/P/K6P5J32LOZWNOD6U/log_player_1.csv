"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to secure a good portion upfront due to the inflation factor.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer is reasonable considering the inflation, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob is right, my offer WAS reasonable considering the inflation.  He's also leveraging the fact that he doesn't experience inflation to push for a slightly better deal. 

Let's analyze:

* **If I reject:**  I'm banking on getting a significantly better offer in the next round to make up for another 10% inflation loss. That's risky.
* **If I accept:** I still get a decent chunk of the money, even with the initial inflation hit. 

This close to the start, I think it's wiser to play it a bit safer.
