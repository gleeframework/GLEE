"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division where I receive $5500 and Bob receives $4500, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split considering the inflation rates we face. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4545 
# Bob gain: 5455 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation, let's evaluate the offer. For me, the money is worth 5% less, so the $4545 offered is actually worth less than its face value. However, considering the increasing devaluation of the money, especially for Bob, and the fact that his offer attempts to balance the impact of inflation, it seems like a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer might be more beneficial than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Therefore, I decide to accept Bob's offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
