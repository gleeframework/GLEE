"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

In this case, I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm not willing to accept a 2:4 split, as I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}

I'm offering a 30/70 split, where I'll take $300,000 and Bob will take $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation effect on my end, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. This means I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer. A 25/75 split is still better than the 0/100 split I'd get if I rejected and the game continued.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
