Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to compromise.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, one more try. This is my final offer. It's a fair deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not budging much further. It's now or never. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob, even though it's a bad deal objectively. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is experiencing extreme inflation.  Getting $3,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice's messages suggest she's becoming less willing to negotiate.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round makes the potential gains significantly worse for Bob.

It's a classic example of a game theory scenario where delaying for a marginally better deal could result in a much worse outcome."
