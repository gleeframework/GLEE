"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's see if we can do better!  I think I can get a bigger share considering the inflation impact is higher for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we should aim for a more balanced split.  The inflation is higher for you, but I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is decreasing faster. I'll meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to compensate for the loss. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting me hard. It's better to take this offer and secure a decent amount rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
