"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a third 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up most of the money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
