"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and efficient, Bob. I believe this split reflects the value I bring to the table.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's proposal is fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal. It's only the first round, and the money is still worth its full value. Let's see if we can negotiate!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  I'm proposing a slight shift in the distribution, reflecting my own contribution.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing valuable time!  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a slight adjustment to my previous offer, reflecting the time pressure. This is a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is right, we're losing time.  Her offer is closer to my previous proposal, and with the inflation, it's a good deal.  Let's end this."
