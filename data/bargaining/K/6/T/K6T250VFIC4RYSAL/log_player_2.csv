"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it a bit more even. This offer won't be on the table for long!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. Think carefully! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm banking on Alice cracking under the pressure of the shrinking pot in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. By framing this as my ""final offer"" I'm hoping she'll see it as her last chance to get a decent amount, even if it's slightly less than she wanted initially.  The inflation is a factor, but pushing for a near even split now is important to maximize potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. You're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly playing hardball, but she's still offering more than she would if the game went to the final round. I'm betting she'll get nervous as the rounds dwindle and offer me a larger share soon. The inflation hurts, but holding out a bit longer is worth the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it before inflation eats away at this deal any further!""}

**Reasoning:**  It's time to drop the act and go for a strong, fair offer.  Alice has proven she's willing to play hardball, but the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. A 50/50 split is the most logical outcome, and presenting it now might be our last best chance for a clean resolution before panic sets in during the final rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll take a bit more, thanks! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice has shown no signs of budging, and with each round, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. If I reject this, there's a good chance she'll offer me even less next round, and I'll be forced to take a worse deal or risk getting nothing at all."
