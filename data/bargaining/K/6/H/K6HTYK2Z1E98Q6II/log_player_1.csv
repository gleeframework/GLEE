"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small amount to ensure he accepts the offer and we can both get the most money possible. Since the money is worth less for me each round, it's in my best interest to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still worth more to me to reject and make a counter-offer. Even with the inflation, I can still get a better deal by proposing a slightly less even split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than he proposed, but it's still a significant amount. Since the money is worth less for me each round, I need to secure a deal that benefits me more than a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'm gaining, it's not worth risking another round and potentially getting an even worse offer. At this point, I'm better off accepting Bob's offer and securing at least some of the money."
