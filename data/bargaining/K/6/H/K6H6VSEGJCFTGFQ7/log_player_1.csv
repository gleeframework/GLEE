Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but that's too much of a difference for me. Let's split it more evenly this time, and avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
