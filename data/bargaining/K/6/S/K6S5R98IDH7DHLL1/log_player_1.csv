"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get a decent amount of money right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since Bob's offer is not as favorable to me as my initial offer, I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. In this round, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so his actual gain is $5700 (6000 / 0.95).

My gain of $4000 is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In the next round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but it's worth 10% less for Bob (5% less than the previous round). I'll try to take advantage of this.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent amount, and I'm getting a bit more than in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in this round.

My gain of $4500 is still worth the same as in the first round.

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 14.26% less than the first round, which is $5500 / 0.85474 = $6436.36.

This offer is not as favorable to me as my previous one, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but it's worth 19.51% less for Bob (5% less than the previous round).

I'll try to take advantage of this by offering Bob a smaller share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'm getting a larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in this round.

My gain of $5000 is still worth the same as in the first round.

Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 22.62% less than the first round, which is $5000 / 0.77738 = $6447.71.

This is a 50/50 split, which is not a bad offer considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. I'll accept this offer.
