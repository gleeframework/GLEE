"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. I'm taking the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 95% of the original $6,000 I offered in the first round. That's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but a bit more in my favor. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the current $9,000 (95% of the original $10,000), which is $4,050. I'm taking the remaining $4,950."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but don't think you're getting the better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less now (5% less in each of the previous 3 rounds), I'll have to adjust my calculations.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,500, which is worth 45% of the original $10,000. That's a good offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for it.

However, I notice that Bob is offering me a slightly smaller share than before, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the $4,500."
