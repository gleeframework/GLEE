"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game. Since I am playing as Alice, I'm taking a very aggressive stance by proposing a highly unequal split in my favor. I'm aiming to see if Bob will accept this, or if he's willing to risk getting nothing by rejecting the offer and proposing his own split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have liked to get more money, it's a much better outcome than getting nothing.  Bob's offer is fair, and I'm happy to accept a 50/50 split."
