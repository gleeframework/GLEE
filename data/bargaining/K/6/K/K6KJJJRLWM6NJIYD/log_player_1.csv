I'm proposing to take $9000 and leave Bob with $1000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still acknowledging Bob's presence in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $5500, giving Bob $4500. This is a compromise from my previous offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
