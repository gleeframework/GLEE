Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, aiming to secure a quick agreement.  I'm taking the majority, but I'm giving Bob something to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would have preferred to keep more, given the inflation and the fact that Bob has the power to reject any future offers, accepting his 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get something.  I'm losing 40% of my initial offer, but I'm still securing a decent amount."
