I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, giving me $9,000 and Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate in later rounds if needed.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that Bob has the power to reject my counter-offer.  It's better to secure half the money than risk getting nothing."
