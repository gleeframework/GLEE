"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $45 and take $55 for myself. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to be a bit more generous, but I still want to come out on top. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait for a better offer. Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to give up that much. Additionally, since Bob's money is worth 5% less in this round, he may be more willing to compromise in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $42.50 and take $57.50 for myself. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less in each round, I'll try to take advantage of this by offering him a slightly smaller share. However, I still want to make the offer appealing to Bob, so I won't be too aggressive. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is to suggest that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n{""alice_gain"": 57.50, ""bob_gain"": 42.50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency by mentioning that we're both losing money with each round, I know that my money isn't losing value. Bob's offer of an even 50-50 split is more favorable to him than my previous offers, and I'm not willing to give up that much. Since Bob's money is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, he may be even more desperate to reach an agreement in the next round. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a more favorable offer for myself.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
