"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and hopefully, he'll accept the offer. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split.  Let's end this quickly and avoid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer of $450,000 for me and $550,000 for himself. While the message ""My turn to propose a fairer split. Let's end this quickly and avoid inflation"" is an attempt to persuade me to accept, I think I can get a better deal. Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less, but I still want a bigger share. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll take that into account when making my offer. I'll propose that I receive $560,000 and Bob receives $440,000. My message to Bob is: ""Let's find a middle ground"".
