"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the proposal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this deal, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's true that inflation has devalued my potential gains, I'm still in a relatively strong position.  I have 10 rounds left, and I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. I'm willing to compromise a bit from my previous offer, but I still believe I can secure a good deal. I'm counting on Bob recognizing that the value of the money is decreasing with each round, and that he may want to take this offer before it gets any worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is now much more favorable to him, I'm still holding out.  The inflation has taken a bite out of my potential gains, but I still have 8 rounds to try and improve the deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that his own potential gain is also decreasing with each passing round and that he might be more willing to compromise in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still trying to hold out for a better deal. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that the value of the money is decreasing with each round and that he may want to take this offer before it gets any worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the impact of inflation, I believe I still have some leverage. With 6 rounds left, I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that his potential gains are also shrinking with each round and that he might be willing to offer me a more equitable split in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still holding onto some hope of getting a better deal. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the diminishing value of the money with each round and be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is taking a serious toll now. While I'm not thrilled with the deal, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the value of the money will continue to drop, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal. I'm taking what I can get at this point."
