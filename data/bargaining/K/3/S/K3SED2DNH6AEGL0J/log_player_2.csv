"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take the bigger share since I'm more affected by inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with taking the smaller share, especially since Alice gets a much better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what she proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation impacts on us both. Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my last offer before the money starts losing significant value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's clear Alice is unwilling to budge further.  Considering the inflation, accepting this offer is the best option to secure some value before it further diminishes."
