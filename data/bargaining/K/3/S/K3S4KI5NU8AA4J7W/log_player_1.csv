"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a more even split, accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive some money.  The inflation rate is a significant factor, and  a smaller gain now is better than risking a potentially much lower payout in the future."
