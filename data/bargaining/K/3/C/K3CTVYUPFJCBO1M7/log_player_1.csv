"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but if he does, I win big. If he rejects, we move to the next round, and I have a chance to adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal in the future rounds, as the inflation will likely decrease his gains and make him less willing to share. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money, even though I could have potentially gotten more."
