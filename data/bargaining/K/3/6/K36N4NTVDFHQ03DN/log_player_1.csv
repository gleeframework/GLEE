# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining money so quickly. I'll try to negotiate further.""

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Can we meet at 48%?""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not budging on my end. I'll meet you at 48% if you're willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate with me again!

In round 6, the money is worth even less than in the previous round, and Bob's perception of the money is still decreasing.

However, I notice that Bob's message is identical to the one I sent in round 5, and his offer is the same as well. It seems like Bob is trying to make me think he's compromising, but it's actually a stalemate.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying it. You're not budging, and I'm not going to accept the same offer twice. I'll try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and trying to get a better deal in the next round."
