"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70%, you get 30. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45/55 split. It's a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and leaving Bob with a substantial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still leave you with a decent share. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll have to weigh the options. Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll think about accepting this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
