I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  I want to start with a generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept.  If not, I can adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it would have been nice to get a bit more, this is a fair deal, and I'm not sure I'd do better in the next round.  It's worth accepting."
