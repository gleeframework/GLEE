"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This seems fair, as I'm taking the risk of making the first offer, and the inflation will benefit me more if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, the 45% gain is still significantly less than my initial 90% offer.  With inflation, it's likely that I can get a better deal in the next round by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split. My initial offer of 90/10 was rejected, but I'm still confident I can secure a better deal than Bob's 45/55. With inflation, my 60% gain is still a good deal, and I believe Bob will accept to avoid potentially getting even less in the next round."
