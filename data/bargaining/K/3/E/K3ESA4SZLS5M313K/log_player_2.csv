**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. However, even with the decreasing value, accepting a deal where I consistently get significantly less isn't in my best interest. I need to show firmness to push her towards a more equitable split."
