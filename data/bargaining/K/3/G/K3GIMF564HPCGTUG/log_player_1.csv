"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a simple and fair division. I will take $90 and Bob will get $10.  This ensures that both of us get a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
