"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept quickly so we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage of gaining more than Bob. However, the risk of inflation is increasing with each round, so I might be better off accepting a smaller gain now rather than risking a larger gain in the future.

I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
