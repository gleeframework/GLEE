"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's split it 90/10.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something, I think I can do better with a little patience and negotiation. The inflation on Alice's side could be a factor in her getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is fair considering the inflation.  Let's make a deal and avoid further losses.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm not willing to take less than half, and the inflation is hitting us both.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is much more in my favor, and I'm willing to accept it.  While I could try to negotiate further, the inflation on Alice's side will make it harder for me to get a better deal in future rounds."
