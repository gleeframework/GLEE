"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a fair split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now.
