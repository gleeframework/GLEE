"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'll propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to take it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair deal.  I'd rather have $5000 than risk getting nothing in the next round."
