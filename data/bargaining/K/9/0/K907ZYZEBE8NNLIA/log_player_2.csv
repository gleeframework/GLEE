"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is impacting you, but your previous offer was too imbalanced. This is a 55/45 split, which is more reasonable considering there's still a risk for both of us if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
