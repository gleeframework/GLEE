"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think 4:1 is too skewed. I'm offering a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
