"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

This offer gives me a large share, but I want to see how Bob reacts to it. It's a bit of a gamble, but if he rejects, the inflation could make the next rounds much less favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable to me, even with the discounted value. While the inflation affects my gains more than his, it's still not worth accepting such a lopsided deal. I'll try to negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 70 for me and 30 for Bob. I'm hoping this is more appealing to him, given the inflation that's now in play. This should still leave me with a sizable portion of the money while acknowledging Bob's potential for a larger share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too lopsided in his favor. While the inflation is hurting my potential gains significantly, I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me such a small share. I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 60 for me and 40 for Bob. The inflation is taking a toll, but I'm hoping this offer is reasonable enough for Bob to accept. I need to find a balance between securing a decent share for myself and avoiding a situation where we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains, I'm still not willing to accept a deal that gives me such a small share. I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome for myself in the next round. Even though the risk of getting nothing is increasing, I'm not ready to settle for a deal that feels unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

The inflation is starting to get really serious, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer I can make, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement at this point.  If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we risk getting nothing at all."
