I'm going to try and get the majority of the money, but I'm also willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully secure his agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While the money Bob is offering me is worth less than the money I was offering him in the first round, the money I would get would be worth far less than the money I offered him in the first round due to inflation. I'm willing to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger portion this time, but still a smaller portion than I offered in round one. I'm hoping that he'll be more willing to accept an offer that is closer to what I offered him in the first round, as he has seen the impact of inflation on the value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough choice, as the money Bob is offering me is worth significantly less than what I initially offered him. However, the inflation has also decreased the value of the money I would get, making it less appealing to accept. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach this time. I'm going to offer Bob a larger portion than I did in round 3, hoping that he'll be more willing to accept an offer that is closer to the value he received in his offer in round 4. While inflation has taken its toll on the value of money, I'm still hoping to secure a decent amount for myself."
