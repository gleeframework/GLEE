Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can both do better.  Let's try to be more equitable this time, considering the inflation we're both facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation.  While her offer is framed as ""equitable,"" it heavily favors her, especially considering the faster rate of inflation on her end. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to play hardball and wait for a more reasonable offer."
