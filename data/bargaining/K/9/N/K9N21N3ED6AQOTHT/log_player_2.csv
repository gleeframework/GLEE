"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and I'll take the rest. We can discuss further if you don't like it. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm not going to accept a 20/80 split right off the bat.  I'm not sure how Alice's offer is ""fair,"" and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable way to divide the money. We can adjust if you have a better idea, but I think this is a good place to start.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise on a 60/40 split. Take $4000 and I'll take $6000. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 60/40 split is an improvement from the first round, it's still not ideal.  Inflation is a factor now, but I'm not ready to give up that much yet. I'll reject and see if I can push for a more even split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to a 55/45 split in your favor, Alice. This is a fair compromise that accounts for the inflation we're both facing.  Let's end this game and split the money fairly.""}
