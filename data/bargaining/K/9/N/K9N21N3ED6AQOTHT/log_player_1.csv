"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and I'll take the rest. We can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable way to divide the money. We can adjust if you have a better idea, but I think this is a good place to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $6,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable starting point. However, I'd like to get a slightly better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 55/45 split, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go 50/50. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6,400 in the second round is now worth $5,120.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 60/40 split. Take $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to a 55/45 split in your favor, Alice. This is a fair compromise that accounts for the inflation we're both facing.  Let's end this game and split the money fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation each round, my gain of $5,120 in the third round is now worth $2,608.32 (48.8% less than the original $5,120).

Considering Bob's new offer, a 55/45 split is still a bit too generous for me, given the inflation. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller gain. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I'll accept the 55/45 split. $4,500 for me and $5,500 for you. Let's end this game.""
}
```"
