"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we divide the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unfair offer. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a more fair deal, and we can both still walk away with a good chunk of money.  Let's be reasonable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe in fairness. This round, I propose an equal division of the money. Both of us receive $500000. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
An equal split is a fair outcome, and given the inflation factor, it's a good deal for me. Let's end this game and both walk away with a good amount."
