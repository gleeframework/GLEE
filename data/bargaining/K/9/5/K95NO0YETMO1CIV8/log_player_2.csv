"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, you get a small share. We can work out something better later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to reject and see if Alice will offer more in the next round.  While 10$ is something, the inflation means that 10$ will be worth less in the next round, and I might be able to get more if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's the most logical choice to ensure we both get a decent amount before inflation takes its toll.""}
