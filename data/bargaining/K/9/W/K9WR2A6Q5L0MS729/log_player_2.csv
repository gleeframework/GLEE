**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split,  I think we can push her further.  There's still a risk, but with more than half the rounds remaining, Bob is in a good negotiating position."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference, last chance! 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than anything Bob could likely get Alice to agree to in the remaining rounds.  The inflation is increasingly impacting Alice's returns, but she's still holding out for more than half.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse deal or even nothing as the rounds dwindle."
