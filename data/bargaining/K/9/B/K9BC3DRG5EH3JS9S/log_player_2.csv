"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value drops further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a bit more than half, considering the inflation that affects me. I've also included a message to Alice explaining my reasoning, hoping she'll see it as a fair compromise. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm going to reject this offer because, even though the money's value is decreasing for me, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice's offer doesn't compensate enough for the loss in value I'm experiencing. Let's move on to the next round and see if we can find a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's settle this before the value drops further.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my proposed share to account for the growing impact of inflation on my potential gain. I'm trying to convey to Alice that it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon, as the decreasing value of the money is becoming a significant factor for me. Let's see how she responds to this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing with every round. Take this offer before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the value of the money is significantly decreasing for me, Alice's offer still doesn't seem fair considering the large difference in our gains. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping that Alice will be more willing to compromise as we're getting closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the value is dropping fast for me. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's end this now.""}\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed share again to account for the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. I'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation and trying to persuade Alice that accepting this offer is the best option for both of us, as we're getting close to the deadline and the risk of getting nothing is becoming more real. I hope Alice will consider the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my potential gain, leading her to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm throwing you a lifeline here. This is the last chance for you to get a decent share. Don't let greed cloud your judgment. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the drastic decrease in value due to inflation, getting 3200, even though it's worth significantly less than initially, seems like the best option at this point. Continuing to negotiate risks ending up with nothing, and Alice's offer, although not ideal, provides a guaranteed gain. I'll take the lifeline she's offering.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
