I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fair starting point considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose an 80/20 split in my favor. While Bob's offer was unfair, I recognize that the inflation is impacting both of us. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure a significant gain for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a tough one. Although Bob is offering more than in the previous round, I am still losing a significant amount of money due to the inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split. We're both losing money due to inflation, but I need to make sure I get a decent share.  This offer represents a compromise, and I hope Bob will see the value in accepting it."
