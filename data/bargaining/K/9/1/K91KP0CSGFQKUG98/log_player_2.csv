I would reject this offer. It's extremely unfair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with 11 rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fair but firm offer. I'm hoping Alice will see that it's in her best interest to accept, as we both get something rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
