"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice.  Now it's my turn.  How about we go with a 60/40 split in my favor this round?  This accounts for the time value of money, as it's better to secure a good amount now rather than risk it dwindling in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
