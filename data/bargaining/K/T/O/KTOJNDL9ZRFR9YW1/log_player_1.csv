"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting a better deal than I initially proposed. However, I still don't think I'm getting the best possible deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account that the money is still worth the same for me, but the inflation has reduced the value of the money for Bob. I'll try to get a better deal than the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll think about this new offer. Considering the significant inflation that has reduced the value of Bob's gain, I'm getting a relatively better deal than I initially proposed. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the absolute best deal possible. I'll have to weigh the risks of rejecting again versus the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the significant inflation that has reduced the value of Bob's gain. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of the situation.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
