"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you $400,000. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We can end this here and both walk away with a good amount.  Let's avoid unnecessary rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a smaller amount now than risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
