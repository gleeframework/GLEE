"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's finish the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 95% of the original amount.

Since I'm getting less than half of the total amount, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more realistic now, but still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation, aiming for a slightly higher share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting greedy, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting greedy!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 30% of the original amount.

I'm getting even less than in the previous offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round if I can get a better deal now. I'll accept this offer.
