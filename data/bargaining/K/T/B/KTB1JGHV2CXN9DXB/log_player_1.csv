"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects me, Bob, but your offer was too low. Let's settle this fairly.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the growing inflation impact on your side, I think this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer is getting worse for me with each round. While Bob is right about the inflation affecting my gains, his offer doesn't reflect a fair split, especially as he's not losing any value from the money. I need to hold out for a better deal, but time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth is helping neither of us. I'm making a final compromise here."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant inflation impact on your end, I believe this is a more suitable distribution now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is eating away at my potential gains rapidly. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to take something now than risk ending up with nothing. Bob knows the pressure is on me, and it's unlikely he'll offer anything better in the remaining rounds."
