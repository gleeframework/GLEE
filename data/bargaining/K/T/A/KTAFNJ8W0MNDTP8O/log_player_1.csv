"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion of the money ($100,000) to see if he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'll know he's playing strategically and we can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation is a significant factor. My share of the money is decreasing with each round, so accepting a 50/50 split is the most beneficial choice at this point."
