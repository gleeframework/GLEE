"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have to agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants a 55/45 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob (10% less in the first round, 10% less in the second round), I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 55/45 split, but I think 55.5/44.5 is a better deal for you. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than he proposed, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
