6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"You can do better than that, let's negotiate!",Bob,2,
,,"That's a pretty lopsided offer. I'm not willing to give you 7,000. I'll make a new offer.",Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer. Let's meet in the middle.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"You're getting close, but I'm not giving up that much yet!",Bob,4,
,,"That's still a pretty uneven split. I'm not willing to give you 8,000. I'll try to make a new offer that's even more balanced.",Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm trying to find a balance. This offer gives you a slight edge, but I'm still getting a decent amount.",Alice,5,

1000.0,9000.0,"You're getting desperate, I can sense it. Don't make it that obvious!",Bob,6,
,,"You're right, I'm not desperate. I'm just trying to get a fair deal. This offer is still way too one-sided. I'll make a new offer that shows I'm not giving up yet.",Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my fair share. This is a reasonable compromise.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500.0,9500.0,You're really low-balling me now. Don't expect me to accept such a lopsided deal!,Bob,8,
,,"I'm not trying to low-ball you, I'm trying to find a fair deal. This offer is ridiculous. I'll make a new offer that shows I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not give away the farm.",Alice,8,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm trying to find a middle ground. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives you a slight edge.",Alice,9,
