"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure about splitting it evenly, as I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more aggressive this time. You can't afford to wait!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000 and keeping $720,000 for myself. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that he might be willing to accept a smaller share now."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's split it closer to even. We both have more to gain by working together. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping to get a bit more. But I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64.61% of what it was in the first round (100% - 35.39% = 64.61%). I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the end, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $360,000 and keeping $640,000 for myself. I'm trying to push for a slightly higher share, but still leaving some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 39.05% of what it was in the first round (100% - 60.95% = 39.05%). I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping to get a bit more. But I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to meet me halfway, which is a good sign. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.
