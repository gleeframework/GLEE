Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, figuring this is a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm ready to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with the inflation penalty, this offer is still a decent gain.  It's better than risking another round and getting even less."
