3000.0,7000.0,That wasn't a fair offer Alice. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This accounts for the decreasing value of the money for you.,Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still too much in your favor. How about 40/60?  It's still a significant loss for me, but it shows I'm willing to work with you. Remember, each round we don't agree, the money shrinks for me, not you.",Alice,3,
