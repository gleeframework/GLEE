I'm taking a big share, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's role in the game.  Let's see if he accepts this first offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount of money. Considering the inflation factor, my gain would be worth only 90% of the original 900,000, and Bob's gain would be worth only 80% of the original 100,000.  It's better to take what I can get now, rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
