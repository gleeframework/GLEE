"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
