"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll adjust my gain accordingly. 

I'll calculate my gain as 80% of the original 3000, which is 2400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, I'd like a better deal""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer and want to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my gain accordingly. 

I'll calculate my gain as 80% of the previous gain, which is 1920 (80% of 2400).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1920,
  ""bob_gain"": 8080,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share""
}
```

I'm being more aggressive in this offer, taking a smaller share, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, I'll calculate my gain as 51.2% of the original 4500, which is approximately 2310.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""This is a reasonable compromise, I'll take it""
}
```

I'm willing to accept the offer since it's a decent compromise, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round."
