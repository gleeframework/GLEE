"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not giving up yet!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, leaving 45% for Bob. Let's see if he accepts this one!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not convinced I'm getting a fair deal. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better share.
