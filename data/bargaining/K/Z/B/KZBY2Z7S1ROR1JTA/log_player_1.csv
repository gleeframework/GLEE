I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing, especially as the money will lose value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take 450,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation rate is making the money worth less each round, so it's a good idea to secure something rather than hold out for more."
