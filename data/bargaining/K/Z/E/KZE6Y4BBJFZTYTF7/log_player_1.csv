"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's try 65-35 this time, I think this is a fair offer considering your higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, my gain of $350,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $650,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'd like to counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 65-35 is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to counter with 55-45""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:
