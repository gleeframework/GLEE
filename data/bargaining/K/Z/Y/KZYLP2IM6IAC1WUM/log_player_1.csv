I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's true that inflation is impacting the value of the money,  I believe I can still get a better deal. I am willing to negotiate further."

Round 3

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still believe I should receive a larger share given the inflation rate is higher for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject Bob's offer. Even with the significant inflation, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal for myself. I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Given the increasing inflation and the risk of losing everything, I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest option at this point, ensuring both of us get a reasonable share of the remaining money."
