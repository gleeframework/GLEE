"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a very small share, as I know the money will be worth less in the next round, and I want to ensure I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less with each passing round, this offer still gives me a significant portion of the money. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing in a later round."
