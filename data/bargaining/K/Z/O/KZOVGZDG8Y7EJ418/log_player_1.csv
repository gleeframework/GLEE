Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
