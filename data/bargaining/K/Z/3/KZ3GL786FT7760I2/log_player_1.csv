"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll consider the inflation effect. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and in the first round he would have gotten $1,000, in this round he's effectively getting 95% of $1,000, which is $950.

I'll compare my potential gain of $5,000 with the $950 Bob is offering, and I think I'd be better off accepting his offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
