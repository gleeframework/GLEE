"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and close the deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this division is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. Let's be pragmatic.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider the rapid inflation on my end. This is the best I can offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""The value is decreasing rapidly for both of us.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting me hard. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting Alice, and her offers are unlikely to get any better for me. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.
