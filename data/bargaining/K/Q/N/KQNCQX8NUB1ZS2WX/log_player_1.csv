"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be realistic: I take 600,000, you take 400,000.  Time is money, and it's losing value fast! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
