I'm starting with a proposal that is heavily in my favor, but still leaves something for Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a small share now or risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although my offer in the previous round was rejected, I'm seeing a significant shift in the offer from Bob. With the inflation effect, I would be gaining less if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a sizable share of the money."
