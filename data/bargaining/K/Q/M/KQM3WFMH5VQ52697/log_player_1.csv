"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me receiving 90% and Bob receiving 10%. This is a fair starting point, and it gives Bob some incentive to accept the offer rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me receiving 60% and Bob receiving 40%. This is a more balanced split than my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering we both rejected each other's proposals."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000
