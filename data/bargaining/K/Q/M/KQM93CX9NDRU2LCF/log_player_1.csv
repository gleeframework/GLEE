Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: More for me, less for you.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. It's worth holding out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking. This offer is a good compromise considering the rapid inflation we both face.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me harder. I need a bigger share to compensate. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob is correct that the inflation is hitting him harder, his offer is still disproportionately in his favor.  We're getting close to the point where accepting a less-than-ideal offer is better than getting nothing, but we can still push for a better deal for a couple more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. A 50/50 split is the fairest option given the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to draw a hard line.  A 50/50 split may have been slightly unfavorable in earlier rounds, but with the accelerating inflation, it's now the most logical choice. This offer emphasizes the need for Bob to be realistic and make a decision before time runs out."
