"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial gain of 800,000 would be worth 640,000, and Bob's offer would be 980,000 for me, which is a better deal.

I'll accept this offer.
