"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer! Even with inflation, 1$ is better than nothing. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 99, ""alice_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'll offer Alice $1, and keep $99 for myself. I'm hoping she'll accept this, as the inflation will only make things worse for her if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, it's better than nothing, and at this point, it's likely Alice will keep rejecting offers that are unfavorable to her, so I'll take what I can get."
