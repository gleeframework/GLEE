"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for Bob, I think I can do better than a 40-60 split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly better split in my favor, but still a relatively fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of Bob's share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to take advantage of this. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
