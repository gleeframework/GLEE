Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, I'm meeting you halfway between my last offer and yours. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial to hold out a bit longer.  The impact of inflation is becoming very significant, and Alice will likely become more agreeable to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. 50/50 is the fairest deal. Let's take it before inflation eats any more of our potential profit!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on! While ideally, I'd like a slight advantage, a 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  The longer we wait, the less we both get, and Alice may be holding out for an even better deal in the later rounds. This is a strong stance to take in the hopes of securing a win-win before it's too late."
