"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and take 60.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not as keen on the deal as I was in the first round.

However, Bob's offer is still a bit better than the first round, and I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
