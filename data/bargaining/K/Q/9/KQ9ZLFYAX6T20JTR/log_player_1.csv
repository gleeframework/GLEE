I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, accepting is the best choice here. 

* **Inflation:**  I'm losing 5% of my potential earnings each round, so continuing risks further losses.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 12 rounds, I don't want to risk being left with nothing. 
* **Fairness:** While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still reasonably fair."
