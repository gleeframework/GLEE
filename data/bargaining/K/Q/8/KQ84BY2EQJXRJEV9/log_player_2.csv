"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the funds with an 80/20 split, favoring you in the early rounds due to potential inflation effects. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the 80/20 split is generous in the first round, I believe the potential for inflation makes it more advantageous to try and negotiate a better deal in the later rounds.  By rejecting, I can see what Alice proposes in the next round and potentially get a larger share as the money loses value."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair compromise considering the potential for inflation. This allows for both of us to benefit while accounting for the decreasing value of the money.""}
