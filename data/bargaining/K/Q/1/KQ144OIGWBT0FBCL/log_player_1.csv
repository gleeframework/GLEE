This is a pretty standard opening move in a game like this.  I'm keeping a good chunk of the money for myself, but I'm offering Bob a small amount to see if he'll take it early on. I'm curious to see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being greedy!  He's trying to take almost all of the money. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to be more reasonable in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal before the money completely loses its value!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly this time. I still want a significant portion of the money, but I'm also trying to be more accommodating to Bob to avoid a stalemate.  I'm hoping this offer will encourage him to think about a more fair split before the inflation gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, but the inflation is starting to hit him hard. I'm going to reject his offer again.  The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm confident we can find a better solution before the money becomes worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to offer Bob a slightly bigger chunk. He's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm hoping this offer shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if he bites!"
