"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest way to ensure we both get a good deal, considering the inflation impacting my share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
