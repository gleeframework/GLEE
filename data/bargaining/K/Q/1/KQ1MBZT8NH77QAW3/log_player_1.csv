"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems fair, considering I'm only losing 5% of my value each round while Bob loses 10%. Let's see if he's willing to accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy!  I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower split than the first round, but still more in my favor.  Bob's greediness and the inflation factor will hopefully push him towards accepting this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn.  Inflation is hitting him harder now, so I'll stick to my guns and try to get a better offer in the next round.  I'm not giving in to his demands!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but still keep a significant portion of the money.  Inflation is working in my favor, and I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that he needs to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting dicey!  Even though Bob's offer is worse than the previous rounds, inflation is really starting to hurt.  He's offering an even split now, and with each passing round, the value of the money keeps dropping for both of us.  It's better to take what I can get now before the value drops even further."
