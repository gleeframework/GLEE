"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the money loses value for you, Alice, but my offer in round 1 was fair. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, I need to get a decent share considering the inflation. This is my final offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the same offer you gave me. It seems like a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the same as round 1, my potential gains are diminishing significantly due to inflation. Accepting 60% now is better than risking even less in future rounds. It's a compromise, but the best I'm likely to get at this point."
