"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. I take the lion's share, and you get a small token of appreciation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and 1,000 dollars is a pittance. I'll see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to divide this money.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hitting you harder, so I'm willing to give you a larger share this time.  But I'm still taking the majority. Accept this and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 100,000 is more than the initial offer, it's still a very small share considering the inflation hit. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling the effects of inflation, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor this time. It's a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is really hitting you hard now. I'm taking a smaller cut, but I'm still the one making the offer. Let's end this before things get worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm taking a big hit from inflation, and I need to secure some money before it drops further.  Even though it's not ideal, I'll accept this offer."
