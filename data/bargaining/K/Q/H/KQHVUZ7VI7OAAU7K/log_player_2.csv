"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly and avoid inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  Even though the offer is ""fair"" in terms of the starting amount, I'm going to try to take advantage of Alice's higher inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split it more evenly, but with a slight advantage for me to compensate for the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation loss 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still trying to maximize my gain, and I think I can get a better deal. Alice's inflation rate is still higher, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I still need to account for the inflation difference.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, we're both losing to inflation 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the losses we've both incurred."
