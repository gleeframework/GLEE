Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering slightly more, time is running out and the inflation is hurting Bob's potential gains more and more. It's still beneficial for Bob to hold out for a better deal, even if it means accepting a slightly less favorable outcome than a 50/50 split in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"":  ""This is a compromise, Alice.  Inflation is hurting me more each round, so let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. But I'll only give in a little 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The inflation is severely cutting into Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as the rounds progress. It's clear Alice is comfortable waiting, so Bob needs to secure something before it's too late."
