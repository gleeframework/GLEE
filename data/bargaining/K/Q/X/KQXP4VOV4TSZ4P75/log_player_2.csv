"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  I'm offering you 4000, and I'll take the rest. Let's see if we can agree on something in this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  With inflation impacting us both, it seems like the fairest solution.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With inflation, my gains are getting smaller, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise."
