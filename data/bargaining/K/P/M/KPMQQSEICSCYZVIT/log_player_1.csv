"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not splitting 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the 40/60 split. However, I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.
