"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and leave $450,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly suggestion that this is a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, but I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not going to take the bait. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $600,000, even if it's worth 5% less than the initial $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate further."

  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw and split it 50/50!""
}
