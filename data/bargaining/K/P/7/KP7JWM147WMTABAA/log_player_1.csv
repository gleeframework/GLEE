"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm hoping for a more even split in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly better deal for me than my original proposal. I'll take the 40 dollars and hope that Bob will be willing to negotiate a more even split in future rounds."
