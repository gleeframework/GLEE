Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is dropping fast. I'm offering you the same as last round, which is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The money is losing value quickly for both of us, but especially for me (Bob). Every round makes the potential gains less appealing.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has offered the same 55/45 split twice now. This suggests she might be unwilling to budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in the future is very risky.  There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and the value we're arguing over will continue to shrink.

Taking the 450,000 now is a safer bet than gambling on a future offer that might never come or be significantly worse due to inflation."
