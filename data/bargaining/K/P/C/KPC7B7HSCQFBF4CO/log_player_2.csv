"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While I only gain $1000, she gains $9000.  Given the inflation working against Alice, it's highly likely I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly this time. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider that the value of the money decreases for you each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it evenly this time, since the money is losing value for me with each round. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good offer for me now.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is willing to split the money evenly. Accepting this ensures I get a fair share, and it's better to take this deal now before her offer potentially gets worse for me in the next round."
