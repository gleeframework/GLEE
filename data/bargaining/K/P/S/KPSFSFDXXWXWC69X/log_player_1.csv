"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start negotiating from here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,000.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain in this round is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). So, I'll aim to get a bit more this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to take the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Due to inflation, my gain of $3,000 in this round is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I'm willing to accept this offer since it's still a decent compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
