Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split. I figure I can get a good chunk of the money while still giving Bob something to consider.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair split. It's better than getting nothing in the end!"
