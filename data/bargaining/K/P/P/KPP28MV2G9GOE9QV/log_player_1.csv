"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder to Bob to accept and finalize the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to make a counteroffer to increase my gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think of a better deal, let's negotiate!""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. The message is a hint that I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a larger portion for myself."
