"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.95 = $380,000
* Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.95 = $570,000

Not a bad offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal. Think about it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $20,000 and decreasing Bob's share by the same amount, hoping he'll find this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, I'll take what I can get 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* Alice gain: $300,000 x 0.857 (1 - 0.143) = $257,100
* Bob gain: $700,000 x 0.857 = $600,900

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to run out of time. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground. Think about it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $150,000 from the previous round, hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable compromise."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is being stubborn!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* Alice gain: $250,000 x 0.778 (1 - 0.222) = $194,500
* Bob gain: $750,000 x 0.778 = $584,500

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is being ruthless!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* Alice gain: $150,000 x 0.698 (1 - 0.302) = $104,700
* Bob gain: $850,000 x 0.698 = $592,300

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's getting close to the deadline. Let's split it 50/50 and end this!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, suggesting a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a way to end the game quickly and fairly."
