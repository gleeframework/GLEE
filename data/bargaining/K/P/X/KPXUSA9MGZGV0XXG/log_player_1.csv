Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big initial offer, hoping to secure a large portion early on!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is not great, but it's not completely unreasonable given the inflation. However, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but still aiming for a significant share. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not great, but with the inflation, I'm taking a significant hit.  It's better than nothing, and I'm not confident I can do much better in the next round."
