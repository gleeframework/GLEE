"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm making the offer now.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my thinking due to the inflation.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,800 in terms of purchasing power. This is a relatively smaller share than in the first round, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob is trying to get a 60-40 split.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,800 in terms of purchasing power. To counter Bob's offer, I'll aim for a 55-45 split.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for 60-40, but I think 55-45 is a more balanced split.""
}
```"
