"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to start with, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate and we can reach a more favorable split for me in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split.  I think we both deserve a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too even for my taste, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd rather get something than nothing, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
