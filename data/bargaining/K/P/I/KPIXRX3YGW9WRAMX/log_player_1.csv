"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit stingy, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and leaving room for future negotiations."
