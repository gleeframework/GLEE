"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll need to be cautious and think carefully about Bob's new offer.
