"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that you proposed a 40/60 split in the first round. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since I was initially proposing a 60/40 split. I think I should get a better deal considering the initial proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. This way, we can both get a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
