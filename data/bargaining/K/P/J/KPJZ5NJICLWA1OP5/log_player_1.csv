"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a better split! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, my gain of $3000 is worth 80% of the original $6000 I could have gotten in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 87.5% of the original $4000 he could have gotten in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 45/55!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving me 45% of the remaining $10,000 and leaving Bob with 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your proposal, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in this round:

My gain of $5000 is worth 50% of the original $6000 I could have gotten in the first round, considering the 48.8% reduction in value.
Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 62.5% of the original $4000 he could have gotten in the first round, considering the 14.26% reduction in value.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this is a relatively even split, and I'm not getting a bad deal. I'll accept this offer.
