"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk too. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 from Round 1 is now worth $5,400.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'm not thrilled about taking only $3,000, but I'm willing to accept it since it's better than going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
