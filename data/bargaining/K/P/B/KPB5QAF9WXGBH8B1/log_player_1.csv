"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, which is a relatively fair split, considering the initial amount is $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'd rather not accept this offer, since I'm still not getting a very good deal. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, let's try for a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. I think this is a good opportunity to settle for a fair share.
