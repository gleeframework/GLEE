"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair and generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better split, Alice! How about this? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain in Round 2 is 300,000, which is 10% less than 600,000, so I'll have to accept a lower amount due to inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer for Round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again due to inflation, my gain in Round 3 is 270,000 (10% less than 300,000).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 270000,
  ""bob_gain"": 730000,
  ""message"": ""This is my best offer yet, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain in Round 4. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain in Round 1 was 600,000. To find the value of my gain in Round 4, I'll multiply it by (1 - 0.271) = 0.729. This gives me a gain of 437400 (600,000 * 0.729).

Now, let's compare this to Bob's offer. Bob is offering me 200,000, which is less than my calculated gain of 437,400.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less again due to inflation, my gain in Round 5 is 317,916 (10% less than 437,400, and then 27.1% less than 600,000).

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 317916,
  ""bob_gain"": 682084,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
