"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, since the money will be worth less next round. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said 60/40 is fair, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
