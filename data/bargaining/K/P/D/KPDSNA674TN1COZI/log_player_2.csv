""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice. I know my worth. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 90/10. It's a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end. This is my final offer.  Let's split it 80/20.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a significant amount of money. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, we're still in a strong position. With only 7 rounds left, Alice will likely feel the pressure to avoid getting $0. We can push for a slightly better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 750000,

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer.  I'm willing to go down to 70/30.  Let's end this now and both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  We're down to the wire, but Alice's language suggests desperation.  She's made it clear this is her ""final offer"" twice now.  We can gamble that she'll crack and offer a better deal in the next round rather than risk getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, last chance.  Take this offer, or we both walk away empty-handed.  Don't let greed get the best of you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are down to the wire.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer 60/40.  It's a fair split given the circumstances.  Let's make a deal before we both get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's a tough call, but we're now in extreme risk territory. With only 3 rounds left, Alice might be willing to gamble, knowing we also want to avoid getting $0. Accepting $400,000 ensures we walk away with a substantial sum, while rejecting it carries a very real risk of ending up with nothing.  It's better to take a good deal now than risk losing everything."
