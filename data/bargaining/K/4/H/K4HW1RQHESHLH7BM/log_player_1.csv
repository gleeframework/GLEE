"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split, as I think I should get a slightly better deal considering the initial proposal. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob to come back with a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 52, you can have 48. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to try to find a more balanced split."
