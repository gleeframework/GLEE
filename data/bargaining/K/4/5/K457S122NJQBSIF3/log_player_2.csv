Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not happy with your last offer.  Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor.  We both get a decent amount, and we don't have to risk losing more money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still in her favor. Since the inflation only affects her, time is on my side. I need to push for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's go for a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer given the inflation and the limited time we have left. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the pressure of the inflation, offering the same split I proposed last round.  However, I need to hold strong.  Every round that passes gives me a stronger negotiating position. I'm aiming for at least a 50/50 split, if not slightly in my favor."

{""bob_gain"": 5100,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, and the inflation is hurting us both. Let's split the money evenly and end this game. It's the most logical solution at this point.

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally offering a 50/50 split. While I was hoping for a slight advantage, accepting this offer guarantees me a fair share without risking losing everything if we run out of rounds."
