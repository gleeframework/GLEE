Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900k / 100k split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm willing to give Bob a little bit to hopefully get this done in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it is a significant amount of money, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is not nearly as favorable as my initial proposal, and I'm willing to see if I can get him to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to offer a 700k/300k split. Bob rejected my initial offer and then countered with a much less favorable proposal, so I'm going to try to meet him halfway. I'm hoping this is enough to convince him to accept the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation, as the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm going to accept this offer.  Bob's offer is still better than my last proposal, and I'm worried that the inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money if we continue negotiating. It's time to take the deal and secure what I can."
