"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money and giving Bob 45%. This seems like a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given my position as the proposer. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,

}

I'm offering a compromise, slightly reducing my share to try to find a mutually acceptable agreement. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
