"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. But since it's still a decent split, I'll accept it.
