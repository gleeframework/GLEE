Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable solution. This proposal reflects a slightly larger share for me, given our differing devaluation rates, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
