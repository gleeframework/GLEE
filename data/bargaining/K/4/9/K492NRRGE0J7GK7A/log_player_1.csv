"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unbalanced offer. This is to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to take even a small share, or if he's hoping to get more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially tried to exploit the situation, Bob's offer is fair and I would be foolish to reject it. The inflation penalty will only increase with each round, making it less likely I'll get a better deal."
