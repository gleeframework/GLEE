Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money while leaving Bob with a small amount.  I hope he'll accept, but if not, I'll be ready to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and I'd rather take half the money now than risk getting less in the future rounds due to inflation."
