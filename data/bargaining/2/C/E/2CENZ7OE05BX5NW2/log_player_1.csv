"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on, but I'm willing to negotiate in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a bad deal for me. Even with the inflation, my gain is still worth less than it was in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept this. I'm hoping to get at least a little more than $1000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still hoping to get a good chunk of the money. I'm also taking into account that Bob's gain is worth less than it was in the previous round due to inflation.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better for me than the previous rounds, it's still not great considering the inflation.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I believe with each passing round, the value of the money Bob is offering will continue to decrease due to inflation, making a better deal possible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm taking another small step down in my offer to account for the increasing inflation. I still believe this is a fair division, especially considering the diminishing value of Bob's gain. I'm hoping to secure a deal before the value of the money drops too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although this is a better offer than the previous round, it's still not good enough. The inflation is hitting both of us hard, and I'm hoping to get closer to a 50/50 split before we lose too much more value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. The inflation is really hurting, and I need to get something substantial before we lose too much more value. I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is finally more appealing.  The value of the money is dropping fast, and I need to secure something before it's too late.  While I would prefer a 50/50 split, this is a good deal given the circumstances."
