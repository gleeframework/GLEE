"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, this means I'm effectively giving up more value than I'm gaining. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to sway him towards accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less and Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less, I need to be cautious.

However, this offer is a bit more favorable to me than the previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later. I'll accept this offer.
