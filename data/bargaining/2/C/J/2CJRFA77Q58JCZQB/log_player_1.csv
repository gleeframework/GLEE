I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering Bob's money will depreciate faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to secure a larger portion to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise given the significant inflation we've both experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, and I risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers.  It's time to settle for a compromise."
