Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing that I take 9000$ and Bob takes 1000$.  This seems like a fair start, as I'm taking the majority, but giving Bob something to consider.  I figure with the inflation, my offer will be worth more to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more,  a 50/50 split is still a good outcome considering the inflation and the fact that I would need to make an offer next round."
