Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but also be fair enough that Bob might accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
This is a good deal for me! I'm getting $5,000, which is still a significant amount, and it's better than risking a worse offer in the next round due to inflation."
