Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I recognize the risk of inflation, I believe this is a fairer division that accounts for my taking the risk of rejection in the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
