"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's better to settle now than lose money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fair split. You'll lose more if we delay.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking the hit from inflation more than you. I'll accept $55, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, and her willingness to accept a lower amount than initially proposed, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for both of us, and it seems unlikely I could negotiate a significantly better deal given Alice's assertion that this is her final offer."
