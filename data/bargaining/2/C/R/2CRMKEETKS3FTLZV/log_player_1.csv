"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 1:3 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
