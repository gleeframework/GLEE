"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, my gain of $50 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $40 in the first round's value.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
