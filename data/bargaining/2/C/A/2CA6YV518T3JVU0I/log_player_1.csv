"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more equitable, given the risk of inflation. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
