"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'm taking 90% and leaving 10% for Bob.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even with the 5% inflation hit, it's still a much better deal for me to continue to the next round. I can likely get a better deal than this by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer for myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob. I'm hoping he sees this as a good deal considering the inflation hit he's been taking.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While inflation has been hitting me harder than I expected, the money I'm gaining is still higher than it would be if I accepted this offer. It's also worth noting that Bob's offer is very far off from the original deal, likely because of his significant inflation hit.  I'm confident that I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to continue to push for a larger share, but I'm also going to keep Bob's offer in mind. Given the inflation we are both experiencing, I think this offer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although Bob's inflation hit is incredibly high, the amount I'd be getting is still significantly lower than what I could likely get in the next round. I'm going to gamble on a better offer and continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share a bit further, but still offering more than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to strike a balance between maximizing my gain and avoiding further rounds of negotiation.  Let's see if this is a good compromise!"
