Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tables have turned, Bob.  Time is on my side.  Don't let this fair offer slip away. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time.  This is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. Take this offer before the money shrinks any further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most rational choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round due to the 10% inflation.  
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice knows Bob is being affected by inflation and is becoming increasingly desperate. She is unlikely to offer anything significantly better.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in the hope of a slightly better deal in future rounds is too risky. The potential loss from further inflation outweighs the potential gain. 

While 350,000 is significantly less than what Bob aimed for initially, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with a much smaller sum due to the relentless inflation."
