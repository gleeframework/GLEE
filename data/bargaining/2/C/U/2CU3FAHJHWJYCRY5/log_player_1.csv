"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the new amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4800 (20% of 6000)
* Bob gain: 3800 (95% of 4000)

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of meeting in the middle at $5,000 each. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here!"
