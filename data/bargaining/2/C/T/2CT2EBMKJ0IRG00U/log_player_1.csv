"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000, leaving $450,000 for Bob. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to convey a sense of mutual benefit and fairness in the division, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and conclude the game in the first round. This approach considers the decreasing value of money over rounds due to inflation, making an early agreement beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we have to account for. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, the division seems overly favorable to Bob. Accepting this offer would mean I, Alice, would receive significantly less than half of the original amount, while Bob would receive more than half. Considering the game has just begun and there are 10 rounds left, I believe there is room for negotiation to achieve a more balanced split. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a more equitable division of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I, Alice, propose an equal split of the original $1,000,000, with both Bob and I receiving $500,000. The message ""Meet in the middle"" is an attempt to find a compromise after rejecting Bob's previous offer, which I felt was unfair. By offering an equal split, I aim to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, while also considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. Given that we are still in the early rounds, achieving an agreement now would be beneficial for both parties to minimize the effects of further inflation."
