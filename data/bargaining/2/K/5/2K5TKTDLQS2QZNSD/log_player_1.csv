"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess later""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see where we go from here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about accepting a 50/50 split, but I think it's a good starting point. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
