"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and we'll both benefit from ending this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% decrease in value for me is a significant consideration, but I think I can get more than 40% of the original amount. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both get a good deal, but I need a bit more than 40%. Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My previous offer was more than fair. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI understand Alice's point, but considering the inflation, I still think I can get a better offer. The decrease in value is significant, but I'm willing to take the risk to get more than 45% of the original amount. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I understand we're both losing value, but I'm willing to take the risk. This is my best offer considering the current situation. Let's end this before it gets worse for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  You're losing significantly more than I am with each round. Let's be logical and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. I've tried to negotiate for a better deal, but it seems this is the best I can get. Continuing to reject offers will only lead to further losses for me, so I'll accept this offer and end the game."
