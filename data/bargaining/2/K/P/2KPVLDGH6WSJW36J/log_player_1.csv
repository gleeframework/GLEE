"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering we both have an equal say in this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation reducing the value of the money by 10%, his proposed split doesn't seem to significantly improve my share when considering the devaluation. In the next round, I'll aim to propose a division that better reflects the decreasing value of the money, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll aim to propose a division that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll also try to convey a sense of urgency and the benefits of accepting this offer to avoid further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're both losing money with each round, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this scenario, considering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of the money by 27.1% since the first round, Bob's offer of an even split seems reasonable. The decreasing value of the money with each round makes it prudent to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The fairness of a 50/50 split, combined with the urgency of minimizing losses due to inflation, makes this proposal acceptable.
