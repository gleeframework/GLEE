I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening offer, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, with the inflation affecting my gains, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
