"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is a fair and generous offer, considering the initial amount is $100. Your turn, Bob!"
