Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I want to be fair enough to incentivize Bob to accept. We'll see how the inflation affects his decisions!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this a good deal.  The 20% loss makes my potential gains in future rounds uncertain.  I'll take the 6000 now."
