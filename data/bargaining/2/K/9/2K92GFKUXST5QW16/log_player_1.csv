"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 while Bob receives $40, suggesting it's a somewhat fair division given the conditions of the game, where the value of money decreases more significantly for Bob with each passing round. Alice aims to leverage this to her advantage while still appearing reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. This deal won't last forever. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer, considering that accepting $45, which is worth 5% less than in the first round, might not be the best deal she can get, especially since the difference in inflation impact between her and Bob could be leveraged for a potentially better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her offer slightly, still aiming to benefit from the more significant impact of inflation on Bob's gain but trying to appear reasonable and fair. She reduces her proposed gain by $2 from the initial offer, hoping that Bob, facing a 20% decrease in value for his share, might find this more acceptable."
