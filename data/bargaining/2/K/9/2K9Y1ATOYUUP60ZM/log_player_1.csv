"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's try 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the new values are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob in the middle. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more skewed towards me, but still a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now. Let's calculate the new values:

* My gain: 45 * 0.8554 (1 - 0.1446) = 38.45
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.7273 (1 - 0.2727) = 39.99

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you at 50/50 again, but I'm not sure if I'll be willing to go any lower. What's your next move?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer considering the decreasing value of money."
