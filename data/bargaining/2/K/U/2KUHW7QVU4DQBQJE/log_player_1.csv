"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 7:3 split, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 7:3 split, as I think it's too skewed towards Bob. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 45-55 split, a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting 45% of the total amount, which is $450,000, and Bob getting 55%, which is $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, 45-55 is a good compromise, let's do it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm surprised that Bob is making the same offer as I did in Round 3, but I'll take it! A 45-55 split is still a decent compromise, and I'd rather take this offer than risk going to another round. Let's finalize the deal!"
