"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Fair share, let's be friends!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, with a friendly message to encourage him to accept. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get more this way with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for both""
}

I'm taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), so I'm trying to find a compromise that still benefits me but is more acceptable to Bob. Let's see how Bob responds!"
