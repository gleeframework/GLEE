"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm going first, I want to secure a large portion of the money while being somewhat fair.  I'm confident Bob will accept this offer, as getting $10 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me $50, which is better than the risk of getting nothing in future rounds. The inflation would make any further gains I might get in later rounds significantly less valuable.  It's a fair compromise."
