Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more than me. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. Take it before it gets even worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
