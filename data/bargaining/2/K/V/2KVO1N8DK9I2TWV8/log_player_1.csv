"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting 700,000$ and Bob getting 300,000$. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1. Now it's my turn to make a more realistic offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation effect.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, my gain of 200,000$ is actually equivalent to 160,000$ in the first round's value. Not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. No more generosity from me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, hoping to balance things out and make Bob think twice about rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being very generous, Alice. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. My gain of 100,000$ is equivalent to around 52,000$ in the first round's value, due to the 48.8% reduction. Not a great deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money I gain is worth 60.6% less than in the first round, due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to get desperate, but I'm still willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30:70 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting a slightly better deal for me, given the continued inflation."
