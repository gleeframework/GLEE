"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a better offer. Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get a better ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. However, this offer is still a 52/48 split, which is close to the initial 50/50 split. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
