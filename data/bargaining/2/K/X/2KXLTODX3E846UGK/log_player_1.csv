"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to start with a very straightforward offer. I want the majority of the money, but I'm also leaving a significant amount for Bob to encourage him to accept.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable for me than my initial offer. While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Let's see if we can negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to adjust my offer slightly. I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share to try and incentivize him to accept.  We're getting close to the end of the game, so I want to ensure we both get something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less favorable than what I believe I can get. Even though the inflation is starting to bite, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my own share again, hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept. We're now in the middle of the game, and time is running out. I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring that we don't both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is more favorable than my previous offers, and with inflation biting harder, I'm starting to worry about ending up with nothing.  Even though I'd prefer a larger share, I think it's a wise decision to accept this offer and secure a decent amount of money."
