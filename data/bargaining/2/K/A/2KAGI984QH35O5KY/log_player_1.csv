Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. Since it's the first round, I am taking the majority of the money, hoping Bob will accept and we can both gain something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I'm willing to accept this offer.  Inflation is a factor, and I'm not sure how much Bob is affected by it.  It's better to take 10% now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
