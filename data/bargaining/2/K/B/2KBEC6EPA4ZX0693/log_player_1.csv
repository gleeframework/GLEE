"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share for both""}\n\n###  \n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that emphasizes the fairness of this division. Since the money is worth the same to both of us in the first round, I'm aiming for a relatively even split to set a positive tone for the negotiation. The message ""Fair share for both"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more this round, but you'll have a chance to get more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer in the second round. Although the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, accepting a 40-60 split in Bob's favor would put me at a disadvantage. Bob's message attempts to justify the uneven split by suggesting I'll have a chance to gain more in the next round, but there's no guarantee of that. Given the decreasing value of the money for me and the uncertainty of future rounds, I'll choose to reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nIn the third round, I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message suggesting we meet in the middle. This division is slightly more favorable to me than the initial offer, but still relatively fair considering the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for me. By framing it as meeting in the middle, I'm attempting to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness, while also trying to secure a better deal for myself before the value of the money decreases further."
