I need to start putting more pressure on Bob. Accepting this deal at round 4 would be too much of a loss for me due to inflation."

This offer is getting worse for me with each round. I need to make a counter offer quickly before the inflation eats up too much of my potential gains."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

This is a tough decision, but I need to accept. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. If I reject this offer, there's a high chance he'll push for even less in the remaining rounds, leaving me with a pittance after inflation.  It's not ideal, but accepting ensures I get something."
