"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10. This is a fairly generous offer in the first round, hoping to encourage Bob to accept and avoid potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more, with inflation kicking in, I'm better off taking the 50/50 split. There's a good chance the offers will only get worse from here, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
