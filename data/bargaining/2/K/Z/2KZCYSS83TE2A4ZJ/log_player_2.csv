Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 493750 
# Alice gain: 506250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of my potential gain is eroding quickly.  Waiting another round means a significant loss in value compared to what Alice is offering now.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests this is her final offer. If I reject it, she's likely to offer even less in a future round, further impacted by inflation. 

While not ideal, accepting ensures I at least gain something substantial from the negotiation.
