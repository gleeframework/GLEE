Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to settle now and avoid inflation eating into our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, as we both get a good share and avoid the risk of inflation. Let's end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn.  I understand you want a larger share, but I need to factor in the inflation. How about a 56/44 split? It's a compromise, and it's better to settle now before inflation eats away at the value further. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56
