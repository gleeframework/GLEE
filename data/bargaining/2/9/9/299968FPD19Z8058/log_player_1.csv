Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, as we both get a good share and avoid the risk of inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
