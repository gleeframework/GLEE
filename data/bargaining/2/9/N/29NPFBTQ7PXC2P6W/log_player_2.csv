"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since I know there's inflation to consider."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, but with the potential of inflation, I'd like to start with a bit more for myself. Let's see how you feel about this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meeting in the middle, let's try 55/45! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'm going to accept this offer.  The inflation has already started to take effect, and while I'd prefer a 60/40 split, I'm willing to compromise and get a decent amount now."
