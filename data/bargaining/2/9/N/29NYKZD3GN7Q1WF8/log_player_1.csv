Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That wasn't fair, Alice. How about we tip the scales in the other direction this time?  We can still find a balanced split in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
