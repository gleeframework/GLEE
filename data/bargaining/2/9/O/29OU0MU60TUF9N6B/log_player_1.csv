"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can finish this quickly.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to get my share as quickly as possible.  Let's see if he's agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and even though the money is worth less now, it's still better to reject and try to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

While the money is depreciating, I still want to get a good share. I'll offer Bob a little less than last time, hoping he'll see that we need to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now, this is the best offer I've seen. It's still a fair amount considering the inflation and the fact that it's the last round. I'd rather take this than risk getting nothing in the next round."
