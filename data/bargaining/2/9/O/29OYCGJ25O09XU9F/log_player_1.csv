 I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This ensures I get the majority of the money, and Bob has something to start with.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer gives me $6,000, which is still a significant amount, even with the 10% inflation.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all, especially with the decreasing value of money with each round."
