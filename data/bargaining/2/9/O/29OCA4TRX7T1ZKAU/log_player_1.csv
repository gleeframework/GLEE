```

  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a good chunk of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'll get 75% and Bob will get 25%."

# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you the lion's share. You can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty lopsided offer, Bob. I'm not willing to accept such a small share.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable considering the inflation.""
