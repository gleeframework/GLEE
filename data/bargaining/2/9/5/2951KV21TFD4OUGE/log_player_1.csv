"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 450,000. Bob's gain is worth 500,000.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.
