"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This offer ensures you get a good share and we avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given that the money is worth less to me with each round. Let's get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, but my previous offer was more than fair. Let's meet in the middle - 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm happy to accept this offer. It's a good compromise, and we're both better off than if we keep rejecting each other's proposals."
