"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split - 60/40.  I think it's fair to give me a slight advantage since the money loses value faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
 While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth holding out for a better deal. The money is losing value faster for Alice, so she might be willing to compromise more in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point, considering the inflation rate is higher for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you're aiming for a closer split. How about 56/44? It acknowledges the inflation difference but still gives me a bit of an edge. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
The inflation is starting to take effect, and Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired split. It's still not ideal, but it's better than continuing to risk losing value with more rounds."
