Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still taking the bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. You're getting hit hard by inflation, but I'm not giving up much. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is slightly better, accepting now would still mean losing out on a significant amount of potential earnings.  It's worth pushing further to see if I can get Alice to agree to a more equitable split, even with the inflation working against me."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still taking the bigger share, but I'm getting closer to your offer. You are being affected by inflation, but we both need to compromise to get something. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally moving closer to a more even split, which indicates my tougher stance is having an impact. However, accepting now at 30/70 would still mean losing a substantial amount of the potential earnings, especially considering the inflation already incurred.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to a 50/50 split. We're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $350,000 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** With each round, the inflation is drastically eroding my potential gains. Waiting longer means risking getting even less. 
* **Alice's Movement:** Alice is clearly hesitant to go for a 50/50 split, but she's getting closer. It's unlikely she'll drastically improve her offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries a significant risk. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, albeit reduced, payout."
