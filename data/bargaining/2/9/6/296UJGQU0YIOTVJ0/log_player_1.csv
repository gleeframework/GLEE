"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is actually worth $5,400 in real value.

I'm not too thrilled with the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
