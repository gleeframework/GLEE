Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It seems like we both want a larger share. Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This is a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. I'm trying to be fair, but I won't be lowballed. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation. The longer this goes on, the worse my position gets.
