"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fairer. Let's start with 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further rounds where the value decreases. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
