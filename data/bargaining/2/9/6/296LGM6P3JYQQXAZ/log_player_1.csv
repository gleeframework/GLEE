"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to secure a good amount of the money while also giving Bob a small incentive to accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I offered in the previous round.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that we can both get a more equitable split if we continue negotiating.  Let's see what he offers in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to negotiate a little higher than Bob's last offer, but still leave some room for him to consider. I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor. With inflation hitting, I need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I offered in the previous round.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that we can both get a more equitable split if we continue negotiating.  Let's see what he offers in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, to 70/30, in hopes of securing a deal before the inflation gets too out of hand. This is still a more favorable split for me, but it offers Bob a better share than his last proposal."
