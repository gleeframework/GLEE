"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, giving me 60% of the total amount and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not going to accept it. I think I can do better than 45% of the total amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money."
