"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 dollars, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I propose a slightly more even split, with me getting 51 and you getting 49. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less, but I'll still consider the offer.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather get a higher share of the lower-value dollars than a smaller share of the higher-value dollars in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45 dollars, and I'll take the rest. I'm trying to be more generous this time.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
