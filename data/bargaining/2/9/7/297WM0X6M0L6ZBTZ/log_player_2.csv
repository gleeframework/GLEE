"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm taking the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not sure if 60-40 is fair, especially given the inflation penalty for Alice. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fair, but with you taking the lower amount. We both get a decent share, and the inflation won't hurt you as much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and lower my share a bit. Let's try a 58-42 split. Inflation is starting to kick in, so I'm hoping we can settle soon! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm willing to accept this offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, Alice's offer is reasonable, and the inflation is starting to be a concern. It's better to settle now than risk getting nothing."
