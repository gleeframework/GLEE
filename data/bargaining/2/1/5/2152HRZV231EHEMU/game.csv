6000.0,4000.0,I'm willing to compromise.  60/40 seems reasonable.  We can't keep rejecting each other or we'll both lose out.,Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more than 50/50 since I'm taking on the risk of inflation. How about 55/45?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,We're getting close to the end.  I'm sticking with my offer of 70/30.  It's the best chance we have to get something before inflation takes everything.,Alice,5,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about 60/40 in my favor? I know it's a long shot, but I'm willing to take the risk.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
8000.0,2000.0,This is my final offer. 80/20.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time.,Alice,7,
