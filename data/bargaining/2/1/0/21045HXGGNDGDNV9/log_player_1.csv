"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even distribution. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'm not thrilled about taking only 20$, but considering the reduced value of money, it's not a terrible offer. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can end the game here."
