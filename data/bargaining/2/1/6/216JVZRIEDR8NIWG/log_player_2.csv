"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a bigger share but leave you with a decent amount.  Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Plus, I think I can negotiate for more than 40% of the total amount.\n\nLet me know what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation rate is higher for me than for Alice. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's work together!""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're losing value fast, let's split it evenly this round to avoid further losses.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation rates, accepting this offer now seems like the best option. The money is losing value quickly, especially for me, so getting half of the original amount now is better than risking further losses in future rounds. Let's finalize the deal!"
