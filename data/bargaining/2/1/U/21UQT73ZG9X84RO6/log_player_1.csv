Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I want to secure the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer and the value of the money is decreasing with each round.  I'd rather get 50% than risk getting nothing."
