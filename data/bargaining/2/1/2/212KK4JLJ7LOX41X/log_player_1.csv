"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can see where the negotiations go from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to take that into account.

Let's calculate the effective gain for Bob:

Bob's gain in Round 1: 6000
Inflation effect: -5% = -300
Effective gain for Bob: 6000 - 300 = 5700

Now, let's compare this to my gain in Round 1:

My gain in Round 1: 6000
Effective gain for me: 6000

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 60/40 split, considering I'm getting the same amount as before, while Bob's gain is slightly less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 60/40 split. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was a 60/40 split, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a smaller share to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```"
