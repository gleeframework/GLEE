4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will reduce the value of the money faster for you. Let's end this quickly and both get a good deal.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'll be more generous than my last offer, but we need to settle this now.  6500 for me, 3500 for you. It's a good deal considering the rapid inflation hitting your share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting us both, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'll take 4000, you take 6000. This way we both get a decent amount, and we can finally end this game.",Bob,4,
