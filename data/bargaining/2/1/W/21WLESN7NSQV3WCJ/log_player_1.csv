"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's proposal of a 50/50 split is a reasonable one. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
