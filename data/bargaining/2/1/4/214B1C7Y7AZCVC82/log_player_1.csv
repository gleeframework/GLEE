"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nSince I'm Alice, I'll start by proposing a division that slightly favors me, taking into account that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob with each passing round. This initial offer gives me $55 and Bob $45, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this as a fair starting point, considering the impact of inflation on his potential earnings in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the fact that we're only in Round 2, accepting a 60/40 split that heavily favors Bob doesn't seem advantageous for me. The money's value decreases less for me than for Bob with each round, so I'm inclined to push for a better offer, anticipating that the pressure of inflation might prompt Bob to offer a more favorable division in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one I'll offer""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation and the fact that Bob's offer in Round 2 was not acceptable, I'm increasing my proposed share slightly from my initial offer, while still presenting it as a more favorable deal for Bob compared to what I might offer in future rounds. This approach aims to leverage the pressure of decreasing money value to encourage Bob to accept a division that still slightly favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than last time, but I need to get a bigger share to compensate for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite the increasing impact of inflation, Bob's offer of a 65/35 split still seems too skewed in his favor, especially considering that the value of the money decreases more significantly for him. At this stage, I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm hoping that the increasing pressure of inflation will prompt Bob to offer a more favorable division in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer now might be premature, given the potential for a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder; this is as fair as it gets""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings and the fact that we're now in Round 5, I'm increasing my proposed share to 60%, while presenting it as the fairest offer I'm willing to make, considering the circumstances. The pressure of decreasing money value, especially for Bob, is a key factor in my strategy to encourage acceptance of this division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still trying to be fair. Let's split it 70/30 this time. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, Bob's offer of a 70/30 split is still not acceptable to me. Given that we are now halfway through the rounds and considering the much larger decrease in value for Bob, I believe there is still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable division. The decreasing value of the money with each round puts increasing pressure on both of us to reach an agreement, but at this point, accepting a split that so heavily favors Bob does not seem like the best strategy. I'll continue to push for a better offer in the subsequent rounds, hoping that the mounting pressure of inflation will lead to a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll; this is a final fair offer considering the circumstances""}\n\nGiven the substantial impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, and considering we are now past the halfway point, I'm increasing my proposed share to 65%. I present this as a final attempt at a fair offer, taking into account the significant decrease in value that Bob faces. The pressure to reach an agreement is mounting due to the decreasing value of the money with each round, and I'm hoping this offer will be seen as reasonable given the circumstances, encouraging Bob to accept and finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, but I need a bigger share to keep up. Let's split it 80/20 this time. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAt this stage, despite the significant impact of inflation on both our potential earnings, accepting an 80/20 split that so drastically favors Bob is not a viable option for me. Given that the value of the money decreases less for me with each round compared to Bob, and considering we still have a few rounds left, I believe there is room for further negotiation. The pressure of inflation is indeed mounting, but accepting such an uneven split without attempting to secure a better deal in the remaining rounds would not be strategic. I'll continue to push for a more favorable division, anticipating that the increasingly dire impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings might prompt a more reasonable offer in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Inflation is severely impacting your share; this is a last-ditch effort at fairness considering the situation""}\n\nGiven the drastic impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings and the fact that we're running out of rounds, I've increased my proposed share to 70%, while still offering Bob a 30% share. I frame this as a last attempt at achieving a fair division, considering the extreme circumstances caused by inflation. The pressure to reach an agreement is higher than ever, and I'm hoping this offer will be seen as a reasonable compromise, encouraging Bob to accept and finalize the division before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation has taken a huge bite out of my share, so I need a much bigger cut this time to make it worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAt this point, despite the severe impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, accepting a 90/10 split that so overwhelmingly favors Bob is not a strategic decision for me. Given that we still have a couple of rounds left and considering the much larger decrease in value for Bob, I believe there is still a chance for a more favorable division. The pressure of inflation is extreme, but accepting such an uneven split without attempting to secure a better deal in the remaining rounds would not be advisable. I'll continue to push for a more favorable division, anticipating that the drastically decreasing value of the money for Bob might prompt a more reasonable offer in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Inflation has decimated your share; this is the last chance for a somewhat fair deal considering the circumstances""}\n\nGiven the extreme impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings and the fact that we're nearing the end of the rounds, I've increased my proposed share to 75%, while still offering Bob a 25% share. I frame this as the last opportunity for achieving a somewhat fair division, considering the dire circumstances caused by inflation. The pressure to reach an agreement is at its highest, and I'm hoping this offer will be seen as a reasonable compromise, encouraging Bob to accept and finalize the division before the money loses even more value and we risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking all the money! Inflation has been brutal, and I need to maximize my share to survive. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this final round, Bob's offer to take all the money is unacceptable. Despite the severe impact of inflation on the value of the money, accepting an offer that leaves me with nothing is not a viable option. Given that this is the last round and we both face the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement, I had hoped for a more reasonable offer from Bob. However, since Bob has chosen to propose a division that completely favors himself, I have no choice but to reject this offer. Unfortunately, this means that neither of us will receive any money, as per the rules of the game."
