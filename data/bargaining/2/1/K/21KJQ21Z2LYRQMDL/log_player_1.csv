I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer. I want to ensure we both get something, and this gives Bob a good starting point. Let's see if he's happy with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, and the inflation is hurting me more than it is him. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer, but I'm still going to offer a higher percentage than Bob did in the previous round.  I need to ensure I get a better deal to counteract the inflation, but I also don't want to push Bob away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite now. I've lost almost half the value of my potential gain. Bob's offer is still less than what I was originally aiming for, but given the rate of inflation, it's probably the best I can get at this point.  I'm going to accept it before it gets worse."
