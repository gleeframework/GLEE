"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to keep most of the money since I'm the one making the offer, but I'm willing to share some with you.  Let me know if you'd like to negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's much too early in the game to accept such a lopsided deal. I want to see if I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good share of the pie. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still feel like I should get a larger share.  This offer gives you a decent amount, and we can avoid further rounds of devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the devaluation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's more than I would have had in the previous round."
