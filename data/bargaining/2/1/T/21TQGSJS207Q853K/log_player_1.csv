"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer!""}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous split, considering I'm making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as we're both now proposing. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob made the offer, I'll decide to reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 45/55, I'll try to negotiate a better split for myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, it's a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even division than Bob's previous offer."
