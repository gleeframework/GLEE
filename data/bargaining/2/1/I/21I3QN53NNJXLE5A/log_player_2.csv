"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer seems fair initially, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Rejecting allows me to propose a division that favors me more, considering the higher inflation rate I'm facing."
