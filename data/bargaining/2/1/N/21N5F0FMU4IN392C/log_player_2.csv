"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for Alice, so I can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation that affects Alice. Here's my proposal:
```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer deal.""
}
```
I'm hoping Alice will consider this a reasonable offer, given that the money is worth 10% less to her with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split.  I won't accept anything less. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, Alice's gain is actually worth less than the initial 500,000. I can try to negotiate for a better deal since the money is worth the same to me but less to Alice with each passing round.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this rejection. Maybe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the increasing effect of inflation on Alice's gain. Since the money is worth 19% less to Alice than in the first round, I can try to negotiate a deal that slightly favors me more than before. Here's my proposal:
```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact on your gain, I believe this offer is reasonable.""
}
```
With this offer, I'm trying to push the deal further in my favor while still appearing reasonable, given the circumstances. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer or I'm walking away with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's threat, I believe she has more to lose by walking away with nothing. The significant inflation impact on her gain means she's already losing a substantial amount of value with each passing round. I'm in a stronger negotiating position, so I'll try to push for an even better deal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice is willing to make a more favorable offer or if she'll actually walk away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, considering the increasing pressure on Alice due to the significant inflation impact on her gain. Since the money is worth 34.39% less to Alice than in the first round, I can try to negotiate a deal that even more strongly favors me. Here's my proposal:
```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Given the substantial inflation impact, I think this is a generous offer. You're losing value with each passing round, so it's in your best interest to accept.""
}
```
With this offer, I'm trying to take advantage of Alice's weakened position due to inflation, while still presenting the offer as reasonable and generous. Let's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
