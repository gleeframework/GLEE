"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts us both in a tough spot. This offer is a slight adjustment from your proposal to try and find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In Round 1, I offered Bob $450,000, and he rejected it. Now, in Round 2, Bob offers me $475,000, which is 10% less valuable due to inflation. This means the offer is effectively worse for me than my initial proposal, considering the inflation. I'll reject it to try for a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to Round 3. I'll make a new offer to Bob. \n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle to minimize inflation loss.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince we are in Round 3, I'll adjust my offer to account for the inflation and try to reach a compromise. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle to minimize inflation loss.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer splits the money evenly, considering that the value of money decreases with each round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation. Please relay this offer to Bob."
