"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob accepts or wants to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $70 is actually worth $66.50 (since it's 95% of $70).

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
