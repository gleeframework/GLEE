"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. It's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 400,000 split, even though inflation is hitting me hard.  I think this is a fair compromise, as I'm still getting the majority, and Bob is getting a significantly better deal than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than the previous round, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation.  I'm going to take a chance and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm taking a risk here, but I'm hoping this offer will appeal to Bob's desire for a bigger share. Inflation is hitting me hard, but I believe this is the best chance I have to secure a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation has hit me hard, I'm accepting this offer.  I'm losing a significant amount of money, but it's better than facing even greater losses in the next round.  I've learned that Bob is willing to push hard for his share, and I'm not in a position to risk further negotiation."
