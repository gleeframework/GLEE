"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of purchasing power.

For me, the effective gain would be 40 / 0.95 = 42.11, which is more than my original offer of 50. For Bob, the effective gain would be 60 / 0.9 = 66.67, which is more than his offer of 60.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept it.
