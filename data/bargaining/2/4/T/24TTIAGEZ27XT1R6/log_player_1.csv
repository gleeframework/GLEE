Round 2

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still a shrewd negotiator.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Bob gain: 500,000 (worth 90% of 600,000 from Round 1)

It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
