"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 90 dollars for myself and giving 10 dollars to Bob. This way, I get the majority, but there's still room for Bob to potentially accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, it's better to take the 80 dollars now rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds.  The inflation will continue to decrease my share if we keep going."
