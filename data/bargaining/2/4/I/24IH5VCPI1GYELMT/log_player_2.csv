"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're not factoring in the inflation that's eating away at MY potential gains every round.  This is my final offer above your last. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use intimidation and playing on my fear of inflation.  While it's true her potential gains are shrinking, she's still getting the lion's share. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offers are decreasing because the value of the money is literally disappearing for me with each round we waste! I'm being more than fair, but I won't be taken advantage of. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing a tough game, but I don't believe her ""final offer"" claims.  She's trying to use fear tactics, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer.  The next offer should be interesting..."

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and every second costs me money. This offer is more than generous, especially considering the time pressure.  If you reject it, you're gambling with both of our futures. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to accept.  Alice is right about the time pressure. While I'd prefer a larger share, waiting any longer is too risky. This offer is still better than what I would have gotten in earlier rounds."
