"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering 60% to myself and 40% to Bob. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining amount. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"

Round 3

Considering the previous rounds and the inflation factor, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000

```

I'm offering 55% to myself and 45% to Bob, trying to find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is very similar to my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to end the game."
