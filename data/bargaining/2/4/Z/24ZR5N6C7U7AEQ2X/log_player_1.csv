"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm starting with a fair split to see if we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the better negotiator 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he's the better negotiator, huh?

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I deserve to give Bob a 700,000$ advantage just because he thinks he's a better negotiator. I'll make my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You think you're a better negotiator? Let's see how you do with this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and making Bob think twice about rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I want more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit greedy!

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a larger share than I was offered in my previous offer. I think I'm being fair, and I'm not going to give in to his demands. It's time to make my next move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm making a more aggressive move by suggesting a 50/50 split. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in splitting the money evenly and accept this offer."
