"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. This is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to lower my share slightly to avoid getting nothing. I think 85/15 is a fair compromise, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still trying to reach a compromise, but I'm getting concerned about the inflation.  80/20 is a reasonable offer considering the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I'm willing to go down to 75/25.  We're running out of time, and the value of the money keeps dropping. Let's try to find a solution before it's too late."
