"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll think carefully... With the current offer, I'll get $3,000, which is worth 30% of the original $10,000. That's a decent chunk, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

I'll reject the offer for now.

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."

Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think carefully... With the current offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 40% of the original $10,000. It's a lower share than in my previous offer, but it's still a decent chunk.

I'll accept the offer.
