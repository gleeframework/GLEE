"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking 9000$ and giving Bob 1000$. It's a good starting point, and hopefully he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than the previous round, I can still get a better deal. It's worth seeing what he'll offer in the next round, especially since the money is losing value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 8500, hoping to find a middle ground. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8200, ""bob_gain"": 1800}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer than the last round to see if I can get Bob to accept. The inflation is getting pretty serious, and I need to find a compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is significant, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on, but I believe I can get closer to my desired outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7800, ""bob_gain"": 2200}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 7800.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to find a middle ground with Bob soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is painful due to inflation, but with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting. I need to secure some money, and at this point, 6500 is better than nothing."
