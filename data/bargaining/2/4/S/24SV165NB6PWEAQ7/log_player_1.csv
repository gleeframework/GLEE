"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. This is a reasonable split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. Let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer. I think I can get a better deal if I propose again. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll take $57 and Bob can have $43. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. Hopefully, this offer is more acceptable to him."
