``` 

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy here. I figure Bob is likely to be greedy and reject this offer, thinking he can get more in the next round.  However, I'm hoping he'll realize that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases, making it less worthwhile to keep rejecting offers."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation effect is working in my favor, and Bob is losing more value with each passing round. I'll counter with an offer that is more favorable to me in the next round."

I'm still rejecting this offer.  Bob's offer is significantly worse than his previous offer. It seems like he's getting more desperate with each passing round and is willing to offer less and less.

I'm adjusting my offer again, increasing Bob's share slightly to make it more appealing.  I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm starting to recognize that Bob might be getting more and more desperate with each round.

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse.  While the inflation is definitely affecting him, he's still holding out for a large share of the money.
