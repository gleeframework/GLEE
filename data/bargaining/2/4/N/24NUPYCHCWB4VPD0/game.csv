6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I know it's early but a 60/40 split seems reasonable. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation that's going to hit my share. How about we do a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but remember the value decreases for you. My offer is still generous considering the long game ahead.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation is taking its toll on me, I think a 58/42 split is a fair adjustment. This way, we both get a decent share, and I get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value over time.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we're getting closer to the deadline.  This is a compromise - a slight adjustment that acknowledges the time pressure while still giving us both a decent share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I know the inflation is hurting my share, but I'm willing to take a risk. I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor this time. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing. This is a chance for us to end the game with a decent share for both.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, time is running out! This offer is more than fair considering the inflation working against you. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"I know the inflation is really hurting my share now, but I'm willing to take a bigger risk. I'll offer a 62/38 split in my favor. If we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing, and I'd rather take a chance on getting a larger share than settle for a smaller one. Let's end the game with a deal!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous!  The clock is ticking, and your share is getting smaller by the minute. I'm offering a very reasonable split. Take it or leave it - but leaving it means we BOTH lose!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I know the inflation is drastically reducing the value of my share, but I'm willing to take an even bigger risk. I'll offer a 65/35 split in my favor. If we don't agree now, we'll both end up with nothing. This is my most aggressive offer yet, but I'd rather take a chance on getting a larger share than settle for a smaller one. Let's end the game with a deal before it's too late!",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, this is absolutely our last chance! I'm offering you more than you'd get if you reject this and we both get NOTHING. Don't be greedy, let's be smart and take this deal!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,accept
