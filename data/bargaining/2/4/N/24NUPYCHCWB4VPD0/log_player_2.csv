"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know it's early but a 60/40 split seems reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer or try to negotiate a better split in the next round. A 60/40 split doesn't seem fair to me, especially considering the inflation that will reduce the value of my share over time. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation that's going to hit my share. How about we do a 55/45 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but remember the value decreases for you. My offer is still generous considering the long game ahead. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the inflation is starting to take its toll, I still believe I can negotiate a better split. Alice's offer is only slightly better than the original 60/40 split, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get an even more favorable offer. The fact that Alice's share isn't affected by inflation gives her an advantage, but I'll try to use the time pressure to my advantage."

Round 4

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the inflation is really starting to hurt my potential gain, I'll reject this offer. Alice's adjustment is still not enough to compensate for the loss in value I'm experiencing. With 7 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get an even better offer. I'll try to use the increasing time pressure to my advantage and negotiate a more favorable split."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although the inflation is significantly reducing the value of my potential gain, I still believe I can negotiate a better split.

The fact that Alice's share isn't affected by inflation gives her an advantage, but I'll try to push for a more favorable split."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although the inflation is severely reducing the value of my potential gain, I still believe I can negotiate a better split. With 3 rounds left, the pressure is extremely high, and I'll try to use this to my advantage. Alice's offer is still not enough to compensate for the loss in value I'm experiencing, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get an even better offer. I'll push for a more favorable split, as the alternative is getting nothing at all."

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept this offer. Although the inflation has severely reduced the value of my potential gain, I believe this is the best offer I can get at this point. With only one round left, the pressure is extreme, and I don't think I can negotiate a better split. Alice's offer is still not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all, which is the alternative if we don't agree. I'll take the 4300, which is worth 40.13% less than the original amount, but it's still a significant amount. I'll end the game with this deal, as the risk of getting nothing is too high."
