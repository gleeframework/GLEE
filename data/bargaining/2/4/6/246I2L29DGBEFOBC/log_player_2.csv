Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is not ideal, due to inflation, my gains are significantly reduced in each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the original amount, even with the inflation reduction."
