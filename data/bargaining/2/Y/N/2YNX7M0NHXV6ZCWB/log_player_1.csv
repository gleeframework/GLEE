This is a pretty straightforward offer. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share, knowing that the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse for me than the previous round, even with the inflation factor considered. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower share to Bob than my first offer, but still a majority. With inflation, I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than the last offer."
