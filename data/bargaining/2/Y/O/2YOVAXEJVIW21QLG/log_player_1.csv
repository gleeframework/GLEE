"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can divide the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the 300k, it's a generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Taking 300k is a significant reduction from my initial 500k, but it's still a substantial amount. Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a guaranteed 300k now versus the potential for a better offer in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob's offer was lower than mine in the previous round. I'll aim for a slightly higher amount, but not too high to be rejected again.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more generous this time, Bob. Will you take it?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't afford to be too generous, Alice! Take the 150k! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting even more aggressive! Taking 150k is a significant reduction from my previous offers, and considering the inflation, it's a substantial loss for me.

However, I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll accept this offer.
