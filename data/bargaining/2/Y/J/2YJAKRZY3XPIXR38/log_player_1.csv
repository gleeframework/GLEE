"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $6,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
