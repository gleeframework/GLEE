"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$, which is $60, and leaving 40% for Bob, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me harder!

Considering the new values, I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer. Since I'm getting only $20, which is worth 20% less than $25 (60% of the initial $100), it's a relatively small amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value, so I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $100, which is $70, and leaving 30% for Bob, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the new values, I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer. Since I'm getting $50, which is worth 50% of the initial $100, it's a decent amount.

However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, and I'm not eager to give up the chance to negotiate further.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
