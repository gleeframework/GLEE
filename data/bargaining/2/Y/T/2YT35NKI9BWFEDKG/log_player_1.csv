"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to start by being a little generous and giving Bob a small amount. This way, he might be more likely to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than getting nothing, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm hoping that Bob will become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the inflation factor becomes more impactful for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground and avoid further rounds of rejection. I'm still taking the majority of the money, but I'm acknowledging that Bob has some leverage now that I've rejected his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  Even though the inflation is getting worse, I believe I can get a better deal. Bob is getting greedier, but I'm still hoping to convince him to be more fair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out.  Hopefully, this is a fair enough offer for Bob to accept."
