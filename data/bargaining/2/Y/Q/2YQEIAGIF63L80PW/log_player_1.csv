"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're right about the inflation, but I'm willing to split it 50/50 for now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
