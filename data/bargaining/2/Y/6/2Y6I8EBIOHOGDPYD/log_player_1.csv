"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose that I take $999,999 and Bob gets $1.  This is a very aggressive proposal, but I want to see if he's willing to accept a small amount to end the game.  It's risky because if he rejects, I have no idea what kind of offer he'll make in the next round. However, as the game goes on, the value of the money might decrease due to inflation, making any offer in future rounds less valuable to me."
