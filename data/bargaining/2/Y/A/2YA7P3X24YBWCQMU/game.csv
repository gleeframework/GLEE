6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. It's a good deal for you in the first round considering the inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's agree and get this done.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, let's try this again. I'll take a little less this time with $5,500 and you get $4,500.  Time is running out and the value is decreasing, so let's make a deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm willing to give you a little more this time.  Let's end this quickly and avoid more inflation.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than you'd get in the first round if you factor in the inflation.  Take the $4,800 before it's worth even less!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we are both losing money with every round.  Let's end this now and split it more fairly. I'm willing to give you a little more this time, so accept this offer.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm proposing a simple even split. Let's end this before we both lose even more money to this ridiculous inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I'm making a final offer. I'm willing to give you more than your initial offer. Let's end this now before we both get nothing.",Bob,8,

4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, I'm compromising again. This is more than I want to give, but less than half the total.  Let's be reasonable and end this!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  We've both been stubborn and now we're both losing money. Accept this offer and we can at least get something.",Bob,10,
