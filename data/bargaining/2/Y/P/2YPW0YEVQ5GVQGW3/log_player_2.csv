"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair split, let's start with a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 600,000$ gain is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation. Rejecting and proposing in the next round allows Bob to potentially get a bigger share, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need more to make it worth my while considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

After inflation, Bob's gain is worth 384,000 (600,000 * 0.64).  The offer from Alice is still better than what Bob would get after another round of inflation."
