"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split a bit more than fairly for me to show my good intentions. This way we both win instantly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round!  I'm not sure I trust her ""good intentions"" just yet.  ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's fair and we both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but it's important to remember the money is worth less to you each round.  Let's compromise - this offer is still beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is slightly better for me than the even split I offered, and I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. It's time to secure what I can."
