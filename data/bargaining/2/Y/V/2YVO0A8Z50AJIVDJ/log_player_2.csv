I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know the money is worth less each round, so I need to be strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm taking a risk by offering more to Alice, but I believe it's a good compromise. Hopefully, she'll see that this is a fair deal and accept it, rather than risking a smaller share in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I need to be realistic. The inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, and Alice has shown she's willing to play hardball. This offer gives me a decent share, and I'm not sure I can do better in the next round.  It's time to take what I can get."
