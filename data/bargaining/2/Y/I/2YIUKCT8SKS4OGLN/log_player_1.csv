I'm going to start by being generous, hoping to get this over with quickly. I'm offering Bob $10, and keeping $90 for myself.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, Bob's offer is fair and it's getting risky to continue.  With inflation and only 11 rounds left, it's better to accept now."
