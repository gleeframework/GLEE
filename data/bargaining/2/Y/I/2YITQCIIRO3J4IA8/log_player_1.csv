Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 350,000$, which is a good deal considering the money will be worth less if we wait. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
