"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making my decision.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same value as in the first round, but the money is worth 20% less for Bob. This means that in real terms, Bob's offer is actually more generous than my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
