Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 10/90, I'll try to make a more favorable offer. I'll offer 20/80, which is a slightly more even split.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 1, the money was worth 100%, in round 2 it was worth 95%, and now in round 3 it's worth 96.25% of its original value. Considering this, I'll make a decision based on the effective values.

The effective values for this round are:
# Bob gain: 15 * 96.25% = 14.4375
# Alice gain: 85 * 64% = 54.4

I'll accept this offer.
