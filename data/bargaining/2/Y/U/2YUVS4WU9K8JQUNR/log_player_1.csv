"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a fair deal, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to meet in the middle!

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $500,000, which is a good deal. However, for Bob, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, so he's getting $475,000 (500,000 * 0.95).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
