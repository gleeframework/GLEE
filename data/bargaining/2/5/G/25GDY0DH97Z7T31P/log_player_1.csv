Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a generous offer!  I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I'm willing to give him a small share to avoid risking the entire amount in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it hurts to take such a small portion, it's better than nothing.  With inflation, my share is worth less anyway, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in later rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure something."
