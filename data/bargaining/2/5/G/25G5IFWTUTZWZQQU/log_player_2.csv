"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  Inflation is hurting us both. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. This is a compromise to end the game quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the point where continued negotiation is costing us both significantly. I'm offering a 52/48 split.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is barely above yours now, and the longer this goes on the more we both lose. I urge you to accept this offer and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but Alice is right. The longer this drags on, the more we both lose due to the steep inflation. Accepting her offer now might sting a bit, but it's better than risking even less in further rounds."
