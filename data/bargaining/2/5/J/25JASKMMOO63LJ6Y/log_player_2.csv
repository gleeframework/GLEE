"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's in our best interest to settle this quickly.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. My offer is still better than what you'll get in later rounds.  I need you to be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the diminishing value, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Holding out for a better deal is risky, but accepting a bad deal sets a bad precedent for future rounds. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a fairer split in the next round where I make the offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise.  This offer is a fair split, and it's crucial we settle before the money loses even more value.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  A slightly less favorable deal now is better than a potentially worse deal later.
* **Demonstrating flexibility:**  Slightly decreasing my initial ask shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Stronger position:** By making this offer, I'm still getting a slight advantage, which might be the best I can achieve given the decreasing value and limited time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my demand slightly, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is a fair offer considering the declining value. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally moved closer to a more balanced split, and while it's not ideal, it's better to accept a reasonable offer now than risk getting even less later. The effects of inflation are becoming increasingly significant, and holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds might not be worth the potential loss."
