Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Waiting any longer will significantly erode the overall pot. 
* **Bob's Stance:** His message suggests this is his final offer.  Rejecting it likely means getting a worse deal in a later round, or even reaching no agreement and getting nothing.
* **Minimal Gains:**  The difference between Bob's offer and my previous offer is becoming increasingly insignificant in the face of the rapid inflation.

It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting a much smaller share later or nothing at all."
