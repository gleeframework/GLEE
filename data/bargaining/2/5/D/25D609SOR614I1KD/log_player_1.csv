"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation we have to deal with. Let's be reasonable and finish this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, I'd rather not give up as much as I did in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be even more careful. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer I made.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in my favor, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
