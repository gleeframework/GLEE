"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 for herself and leave $400,000 for Bob, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share. The message ""Let's share fairly"" aims to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair we split the money evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share, the actual value he would receive is significantly less than what I offered him in the previous round. Given that my share's value remains unchanged, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Additionally, Bob's message about splitting the money evenly doesn't account for the devaluation of his share due to inflation, making the offer less fair than it initially seems."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my share from the initial proposal to make it more appealing to Bob, while also considering the impact of inflation on his share. The message aims to highlight the fairness of the offer, given the devaluation of Bob's share over the rounds. By framing it as ""more than fair,"" I'm trying to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable compromise."
