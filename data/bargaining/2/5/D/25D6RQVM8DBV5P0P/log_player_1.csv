"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  I'm willing to split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share.  But I'm open to discussion. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is proposing a 60-40 split in his favor, with him taking the bigger share. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob due to inflation, his offer is actually equivalent to a 61.5-38.5 split in favor of Bob, considering the decreased value of his share.

I'll reject this offer, since I'd rather not give up more than 40% of the initial $10,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal for myself. Since Bob is willing to take the bigger share, I'll offer a slightly higher amount to him, but still try to keep the majority.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself""
}
```

This offer is equivalent to a 42-58 split in my favor, considering the inflation effect. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
