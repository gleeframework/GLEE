"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a big chunk, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we both get a fair share.""}\n\nSince there's inflation, I want to try to end the game as soon as possible while still getting a decent share. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable approach for now."
