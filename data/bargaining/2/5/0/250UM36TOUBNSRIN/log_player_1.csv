"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point for the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering 65 dollars for myself and 35 dollars for Bob, hoping this will be more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 68 
# Bob gain: 32 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll consider Bob's new offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and 68 dollars is a relatively better deal than what I'd get in future rounds."
