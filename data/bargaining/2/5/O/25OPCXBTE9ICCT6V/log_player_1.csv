"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I get a slightly larger share, but it's still a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth even less. I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's share is larger, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my share, I'll make a new offer that tries to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This time, I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping it's more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share. Considering the offer from Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept it. However, it's still a relatively small difference, and I don't want to risk going to another round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
