"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, let's settle now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since my gain is worth 20% less, $400,000 is now equivalent to $320,000 in the original value. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
