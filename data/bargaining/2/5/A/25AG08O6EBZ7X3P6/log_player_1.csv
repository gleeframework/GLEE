"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is now worth 40$ in real value, which is not as appealing as my initial offer. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially losing more value. I'll accept Bob's offer.
