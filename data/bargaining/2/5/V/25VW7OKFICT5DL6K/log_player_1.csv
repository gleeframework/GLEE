"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer in Round 2 means I lose out on potential gains I could secure by making a counter-offer. Bob is likely to propose a worse deal for me in the next round, so it's worth the risk to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This offer is still better for you than my last, and considers the time pressure.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds. It's time to inch closer to a deal Bob might accept.
* **Inflation:** Every round that passes costs me money. I need to secure a deal before inflation eats too much into my potential earnings.
* **Compromise:** Bob offered a 50/50 split. My offer is slightly better for me than his, but still gives him a reasonable amount and acknowledges his desire for fairness."
