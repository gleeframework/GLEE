"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a bit more than half, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth even less now. Bob's offer is quite even, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation, my share is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but not too much, since I want to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share! Bob's offer is quite lopsided now, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not get 3000, but I'm running out of time. I'll accept this offer.
