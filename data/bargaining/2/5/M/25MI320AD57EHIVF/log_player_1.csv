"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm being generous to Bob. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to make a decision based on the reduced value.

In this round, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $360,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting $360,000, but it's a decent offer considering the situation. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
