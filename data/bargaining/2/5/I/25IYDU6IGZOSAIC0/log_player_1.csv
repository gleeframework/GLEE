Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take the vast majority of the money, but I'm happy to leave you with a small percentage to show I'm not completely unreasonable.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Anything less significantly impacts my share due to inflation. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
