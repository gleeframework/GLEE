"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing later due to inflation."
