"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable and fair split, and we can end the game quickly before inflation eats away at the value of the money."

# Alice gain: 400000
