Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 55,

  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a bit less than half, but still a reasonable amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly, since the money's value decreases with each round."
