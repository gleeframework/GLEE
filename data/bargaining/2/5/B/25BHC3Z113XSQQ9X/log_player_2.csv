Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal needs to benefit us both. I'm offering you a fair deal considering the shrinking pie. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. While Alice's offer seems ""fairer"" on the surface, time is working against me much faster.  

* **My shrinking pie:** My potential earnings are decreasing at a faster rate (10% per round) than Alice's (20% per round). 
* **Leverage:**  Alice knows this. By round 7 or 8, any offer from her will heavily favor her due to the accelerated devaluation of my share. 

I need to push for a more favorable outcome quickly before the game dynamics shift entirely in her favor."

This offer still gives you a significant share, and it ensures we both walk away with something substantial before inflation makes that impossible.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a compromise, let's settle before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I need to cut my losses. Here's why:

* **Rapid devaluation:**  The inflation rate is severely cutting into my potential gains. Waiting any longer is too risky.
* **Alice has the advantage:**  She's demonstrated she's willing to play the long game. As the rounds progress, the offers will skew heavily in her favor due to the difference in devaluation rates.
* **Certainty over risk:**  While I could hold out hoping for a slightly better deal, there's a real chance I end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable sum. 

It's not ideal, but in this situation, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
