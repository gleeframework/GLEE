"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair division considering the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to propose a split of $8,000 for me and $2,000 for Bob. I'm lowering my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept, but I still need to get a good portion of the money considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 8000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to try and incentivize Bob to accept, but I need to be careful as the inflation is impacting him much more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While I'm getting less than I'd hoped for, the inflation is drastically hurting Bob's gains. It's better to get something than to risk getting nothing at all in the future."
