"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to rush, we have plenty of time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer still stands. Let's not waste time with more rounds, the clock is ticking.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice.  Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even with the increasing inflation, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting $45 now would be significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm taking a hit from the inflation, but this is a reasonable compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the deadline.  I'm willing to take a larger share, but we need to settle this soon.  It's in both of our best interests to come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I need to accept.  While Bob is still getting a good deal, the inflation means that if I reject this offer, I'll be losing even more potential earnings in the next round, even if I could negotiate a slightly better split.  It's a gamble I can't afford to take."
