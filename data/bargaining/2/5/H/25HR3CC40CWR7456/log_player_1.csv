"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $5500 and Bob can have $4500. I'm trying to be a bit generous, but also want to make sure I get a good share. The message is a gentle nudge to Bob, hoping he'll see the reason in my proposal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair.  We can settle this now and avoid losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not willing to accept this offer. Considering the inflation, the $4500 I'd get is now worth 10% less than in the first round, making it effectively $4050. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only 5% less valuable. I think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair adjustment""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob. Given the inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for me. I'm adjusting my proposal to account for this, while still trying to appear reasonable and fair. The message is a nod to the reality of our situation, hoping Bob will see the logic and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, let's split the difference from my last offer and call it a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. With the inflation, the $4800 I'd get is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, making it effectively $3500. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only 14.26% less valuable. I think I can still get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal. The fact that Bob is suggesting we ""split the difference"" from his last offer indicates he's willing to negotiate, which gives me hope for a better outcome.### Decision

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and I'm taking a bigger share to compensate for the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm becoming more aggressive in my proposal to counteract the loss of value. The message is a clear indication that I'm aware of the time pressure and the effect of inflation, and I'm willing to take a bigger share to compensate. I'm hoping Bob will realize the urgency of the situation and accept this offer rather than risking further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is it.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation, a 50/50 split at this point is not as equitable as it seems. The $5000 I'd get is now worth 40.95% less than in the first round, making it effectively $2970. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only 22.62% less valuable. Given the strong language in Bob's message, it seems like he's not willing to negotiate further. However, I still think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.### Decision

Given the significant impact of inflation and Bob's unwillingness to negotiate, I'm becoming even more aggressive in my proposal to try and secure a better deal. The message is a clear indication that I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better share, and I'm hoping Bob will realize the urgency of the situation and accept this offer rather than risking further losses. I'm aware that this is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to try and secure a favorable outcome.### Offer"
