Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier, and the inflation is hitting her harder. It's risky, but holding out for a better offer might be the best strategy at this point. We're getting close to the point where the diminishing returns will force her hand."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is at a turning point. Alice is becoming increasingly aggressive, but the inflation is severely impacting her potential gains. A firm 50/50 offer presents a strong psychological anchor. It's a clear and fair proposal that highlights the risks of further delay. Alice is running out of time to make a better deal for herself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better share, time is running out 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the risk of getting nothing is getting very real.  Alice's offer is bad, but waiting might result in an even worse outcome as we approach the final rounds. Accepting now secures something, which is better than nothing if the negotiations completely fall apart."
