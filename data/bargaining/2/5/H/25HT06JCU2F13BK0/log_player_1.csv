"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each subsequent round, he may be motivated to accept a slightly less favorable offer early on rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but time is money! Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I don't have to worry about the devaluation that Bob is facing. Additionally, Bob's message seems somewhat aggressive, which might indicate that he's willing to make concessions in the future. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to put pressure on Bob to make an even more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Don't let the money slip away""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than my initial one, asking for 58 dollars instead of 60. This is still a relatively fair split, but it takes into account the fact that Bob is under more pressure due to the devaluation of the money. My message is a subtle reminder to Bob that the value of the money is decreasing with each round, which might motivate him to accept my offer rather than risking further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and call it a day. This is the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because I believe I have the upper hand in the negotiation. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I don't have to worry about the devaluation that Bob is facing. Additionally, Bob's message seems somewhat desperate, which might indicate that he's willing to make concessions in the future. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to put pressure on Bob to make an even more generous offer in the next round. Furthermore, Bob's claim that ""this is the best you'll get"" is likely a bluff, and I'm willing to call his bluff to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""You're running out of time""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an even more aggressive offer, asking for 62 dollars. This takes into account the fact that Bob is under increasing pressure due to the devaluation of the money, which is now worth 48.8% less to him than in the first round. My message is a reminder to Bob that time is not on his side, and that he should consider accepting my offer before the value of the money decreases even further. By making a bold offer, I'm trying to take advantage of Bob's desperation and get the best possible deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is valuable for both of us. I'm offering a reasonable compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because I still believe I have the upper hand in the negotiation. Despite Bob's message suggesting that time is valuable for both of us, the reality is that the devaluation of the money is affecting him much more severely than me. With the money now worth 67.23% less to Bob than in the first round, I think he's likely to become increasingly desperate and willing to make concessions. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to put further pressure on Bob to make an even more generous offer in the next round. Additionally, Bob's offer of a 55-45 split is still not as favorable to me as I think I can get, so I'm willing to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're almost out of time""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an even more aggressive offer, asking for 65 dollars. This takes into account the fact that Bob is under extreme pressure due to the devaluation of the money, which is now worth 67.23% less to him than in the first round. My message is a stark reminder to Bob that he's running out of options and that he should consider accepting my offer before the value of the money decreases even further. By making a bold offer, I'm trying to take advantage of Bob's desperation and get the best possible deal for myself. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency, implying that if Bob doesn't accept my offer now, he'll end up with an even worse deal in the next round."
