"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 40% gain in the second round is actually worth less than my 60% gain in the first round. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the lost value. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
