"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start with a 4:1 ratio. You can propose a better deal in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to see if Bob is interested in negotiating a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is fairer, considering the inflation factor. Let's try this and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I don't think a 6:4 split is fair, considering I'm already taking a hit from inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's see if this one sticks!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
