"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, and Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards him. However, I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
