Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"

# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer since I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Getting closer to a fair deal""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's a reasonable deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the decreasing value of the money for me, I think accepting this offer is the best option. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and further rounds would only decrease the value of my share. It's time to finalize the deal!"
