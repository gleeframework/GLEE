"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large share, as the early rounds offer the highest value. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and given Bob's offer, it's likely he's more willing to split evenly.  It's safer to secure half now than risk getting nothing later."
