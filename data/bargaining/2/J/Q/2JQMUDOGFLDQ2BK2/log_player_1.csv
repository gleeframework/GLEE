"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob, considering the decreasing value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness with Inflation:** A straight 50/50 split seems fair initially, but inflation hits Alice harder (-10% per round) than Bob (-5% per round).  To make the deal equitable in the long run, Alice should aim for a slightly larger share upfront.
* **First Mover Advantage:**  Alice has a slight advantage by proposing first.  Offering a bit more than Bob might get in later rounds can incentivize him to accept.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  If Alice gets too greedy, Bob might reject the offer hoping for a better deal in the next round. This risks a stalemate where the money keeps devaluing.

**The Offer (525,000 / 475,000):** This split gives Alice a slightly larger portion to compensate for the faster devaluation of her share, while still offering Bob a significant sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which I think is fair given the inflation.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting worse for Alice. Accepting a 45/55 split now means losing a significant portion of the initial amount, even considering the inflation. It's worth taking a chance to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's stop wasting time. A straight 50/50 split is the simplest and fairest way to end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Every round makes the total amount worth less. While Alice initially aimed for a slightly higher share, dragging out the negotiation hurts both players. 
* **Shifting Power:** Bob's previous offer suggests he's aiming for a larger share than Alice initially proposed. This round is Alice's chance to re-establish a more balanced position.
* **Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and eliminates further haggling, potentially motivating Bob to accept and finalize the deal. 

By proposing a simple and seemingly fair split, Alice increases the chance of Bob accepting and avoiding further devaluation."
