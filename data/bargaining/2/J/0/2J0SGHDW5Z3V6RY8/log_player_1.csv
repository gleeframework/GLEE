I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. It's a good starting point to build trust and potentially avoid further rounds."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much less generous than my initial proposal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this isn't a good starting point. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm also pushing Bob to meet me halfway.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal than his latest offer."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Time is running out, and the inflation is hitting hard.  I'm taking a significant risk here, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize we're both losing a lot with every passing round. I'm offering a more balanced split, hoping to find common ground before it's too late."
