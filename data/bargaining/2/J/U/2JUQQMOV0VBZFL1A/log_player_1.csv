Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to 60/40. Let's end this before inflation eats away at what we could gain. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me (Alice). Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers from Bob.
* **Diminishing Returns:** My negotiating position weakens with each round. Bob knows this and is unlikely to offer significantly more than 60/40.
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting guarantees me $400,000. Rejecting risks getting an even lower amount in a future round, potentially even less than what Bob is offering now. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting minimizes potential losses due to the punishing inflation rate."
