"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share, and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 6000 dollars are still worth 6000, but Bob's 4000 dollars are now worth 3600. Bob's new offer is 2000 for me and 8000 for him, which is still a significant difference.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than that.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in this offer, but still reasonable. I'm willing to give up some of my share to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's 4000 dollars in round 1 are now worth 2919. I'm still getting 6000 dollars, which is worth 6000.

Bob's new offer is 5000 for me and 5000 for him, which is a 50-50 split. This is a relatively fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer.
