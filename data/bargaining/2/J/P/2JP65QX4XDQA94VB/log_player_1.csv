"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a good starting point, but I can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4750.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
