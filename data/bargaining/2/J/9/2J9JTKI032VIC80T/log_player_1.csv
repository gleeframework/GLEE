"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer, giving Bob a small share.  This is to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a real threat. Taking 5000 now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
