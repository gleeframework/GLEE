"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, I think I'm getting a better deal this time.

I accept Bob's offer.
