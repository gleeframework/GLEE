"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a more fair split.  Let's finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, Bob is offering me $400,000, which is a better deal than his previous offer. I'll consider it, but I'm not ready to accept yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was more generous than mine in the first round, I'll try to make a more competitive offer in Round 3. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much. Think carefully!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is the same amount as his offer in Round 2."
