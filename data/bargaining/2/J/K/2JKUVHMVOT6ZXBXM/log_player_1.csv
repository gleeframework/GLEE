**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is finally agreeing to a 50/50 split.  It's unlikely he'll offer anything better in subsequent rounds, and the value of his potential gains will continue to decrease, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal for himself in the future. Accepting now guarantees I get a fair share."
