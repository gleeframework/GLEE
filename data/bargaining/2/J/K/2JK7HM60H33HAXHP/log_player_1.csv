"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts I'd gain as follows:

* Alice gain: 30 / 0.9 = 33.33 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 70 / 0.9 = 77.78 (approximately)

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, which means it's 10% of 10% less than the original amount, so the effective discount is 10% * 10% = 1% less than the original amount.

However, since the money is already discounted by 10% in the second round, the discount in the third round is 10% of the money remaining after the second round's discount. 

So, I'll calculate the effective discount as follows:

* The money remaining after the second round is 100 * 0.9 = 90
* The discount in the third round is 10% of 90, which is 9
* The total discount so far is 10 + 9 = 19
* The effective discount is 19% of the original amount, which is 100 * 0.19 = 19

Now, let's make an offer. Considering the effective discount, I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 81,
  ""bob_gain"": 19
}
```

I'm offering Bob 19% of the original $100, which is $19. I'm taking the remaining 81%, which is $81."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain if I accepted Bob's offer, considering the cumulative inflation:

* The money is worth 10% less in the second round, so it's 100 * 0.9 = 90
* The money is worth 10% less in the third round, so it's 90 * 0.9 = 81
* The money is worth 27.1% less in the fourth round, so it's 81 * 0.7289 (1 - 0.271) = 58.9439 (approximately)

Now, let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain if I accepted Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 50 / 0.7289 = 68.65 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 50 / 0.7289 = 68.65 (approximately)

Since the amounts are equal, I'll accept Bob's offer.
