"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better than that. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the initial amount.

Bob's offer is 7000 for me and 3000 for him. This is a worse deal than my initial offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You said you could do better, now it's my turn to show you I can do better too!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you can do better, but I'm not convinced. I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to let you take all the cake! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering, considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the initial amount.

Bob's offer is 5500 for me and 4500 for him. This is still a bit short of my target, but it's getting closer. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
