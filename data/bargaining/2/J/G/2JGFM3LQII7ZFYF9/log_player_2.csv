"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm happy to take a bit less to ensure we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While the offer is fair in the first round, it's a good idea to try to negotiate for a better share. There are 12 rounds, and the value of the money will decrease significantly for Alice, so she might be willing to compromise more in the later rounds to avoid getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This way we both get a fair share in the beginning, and we can avoid the risk of the money decreasing in value.""}
