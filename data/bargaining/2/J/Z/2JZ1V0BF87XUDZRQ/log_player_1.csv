Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, Alice, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's reach an agreement before the value of the money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is offering a slightly better deal, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round, so I need to push for a better split. Waiting too long will result in an even worse outcome than accepting a slightly unfair deal now."
