"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's proposal seems fair at first glance, considering the potential inflation, it's in Bob's best interest to reject.  A 3:1 ratio heavily favors Alice, and the 5% inflation per round will significantly reduce Bob's potential gains if he waits. By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to make a more favorable proposal in the next round, hoping to secure a larger share of the remaining value."
