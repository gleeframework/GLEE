Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the lion's share this time, since you rejected my generous offer last round.  Let's see if you're willing to accept my proposal. The money is worth more to me than to you now! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","{
