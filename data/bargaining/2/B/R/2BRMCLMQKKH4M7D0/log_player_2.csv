Let's see if we can get a better deal!  Since I know about the inflation, I might be able to get a slightly larger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than an even split. Since I know the money is worth a bit less each round, I propose we split it this way.  We can still both get a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money in a 60/40 ratio in your favor. This acknowledges the inflation effect while still providing a substantial amount for me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll try to push for a more favorable split in the next round."
