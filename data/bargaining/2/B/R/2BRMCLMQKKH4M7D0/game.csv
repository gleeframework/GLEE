500000.0,500000.0,Let's split the money equally. It's fair and ensures we both benefit.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I think we can do better than an even split. Since I know the money is worth a bit less each round, I propose we split it this way.  We can still both get a decent share.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose we divide the money in a 60/40 ratio in your favor. This acknowledges the inflation effect while still providing a substantial amount for me.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I understand the inflation is impacting the value of the money, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, which still gives you a significant portion.  This should give us both a good outcome.",Bob,4,
