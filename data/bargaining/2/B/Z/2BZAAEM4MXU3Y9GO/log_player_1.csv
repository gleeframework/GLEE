"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 100,000 in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the initial amount, but I'm leaving room for negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly since we're on even ground. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'm not as keen on accepting an even split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take this offer or risk losing even more value in the next round!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bigger share of the remaining amount to account for the inflation."
