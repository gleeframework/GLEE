Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and get a slightly bigger share, but still leave Alice with a decent amount.  Hopefully, she'll see that this is a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than my previous offer, I'm better off taking this deal than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. Inflation is working against me, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the future."
