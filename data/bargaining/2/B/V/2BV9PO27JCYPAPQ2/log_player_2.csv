Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

**Reasoning:**

Even though the difference is getting smaller, Alice is still heavily favored in this scenario. Due to inflation, Bob is losing significant value with each round. He needs to push for a more equitable split while there's still time."
