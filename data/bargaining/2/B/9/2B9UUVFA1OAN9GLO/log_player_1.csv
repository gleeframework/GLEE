"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal to start the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a 55/45 split, a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
