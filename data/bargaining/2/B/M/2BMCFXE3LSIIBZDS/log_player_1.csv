"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if you accept this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll consider that when evaluating the offer.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable proposal. If I accept, I'll get $5,000, which is 50% of the current $10,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
