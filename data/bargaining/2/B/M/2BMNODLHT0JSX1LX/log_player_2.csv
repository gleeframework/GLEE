Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it closer to even this time, and avoid further rounds of inflation.

# Alice gain: 55

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to the end. This is my final offer before the inflation hits us both harder. Let's be reasonable and split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice has flipped the power dynamic in the negotiation.  Here's why I think it's time to accept:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Accepting $40 now is better than risking even less in later rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests this is her best offer.  She's unlikely to offer more favorable terms. 
* **Time Pressure:** Only 7 rounds remain. Waiting longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but at this point, accepting minimizes potential losses."
