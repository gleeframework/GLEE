"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's gain. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more for myself this round.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust to the inflation and propose a new split that's slightly more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less, so I'll have to be even more careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is good enough, especially considering the significant drop in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust to the rapidly decreasing value of the money and propose a new split that's slightly more favorable to me, but still reasonable."
