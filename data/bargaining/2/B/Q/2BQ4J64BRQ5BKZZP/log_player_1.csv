"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the initial amount, and Bob's gain is still worth 40% of the initial amount.

I'll reject this offer, since I'm getting less than I was initially offered. I'll wait for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be a bit more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm aiming to get a slightly higher share this time, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! My gain is now worth only 51.2% of the initial amount, and Bob's gain is still worth 40% of the initial amount.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than what I'd get if I wait for another round and the value of my gain decreases further.
