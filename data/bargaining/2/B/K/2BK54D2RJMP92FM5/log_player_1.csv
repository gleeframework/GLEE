"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a small lead""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm actually taking a slightly larger share."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.
