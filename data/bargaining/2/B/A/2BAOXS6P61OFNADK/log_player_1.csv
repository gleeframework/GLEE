"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll decide to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

This way, I'll get a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount considering the inflation."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. However, getting only $10 is a pretty meager amount, even considering the inflation. I'll decide to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really biting now! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my revised proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}

This way, I'll get a smaller share, but it's still a relatively decent amount considering the inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm starting to feel the pinch. Getting only $2 is an extremely meager amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth considering. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll decide to accept this offer.
