Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 80/20. I still think my initial offer was fair, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, time is working against me. Accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less than half the pot, and the value will only decrease further in subsequent rounds.  I need to push for a more favorable outcome quickly."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  My last offer is on the table: 55/45.  It's a reasonable split that benefits us both before inflation eats away at the value any further. ""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly for me (Bob).  I need Alice to understand that time is running out for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm slightly lowering my demand from 60/40 to 55/45 to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting a larger share due to the inflation disadvantage.
* **Finality:** By stating ""My last offer is on the table,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to come down to 70/30.  We're both losing money with each round, and I'm not sure how much longer we can keep this up. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the time pressure and moving closer to a 50/50 split. While 70/30 is not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. Accepting now guarantees me something rather than risking a worse outcome or even getting nothing if we fail to agree within the remaining rounds."
