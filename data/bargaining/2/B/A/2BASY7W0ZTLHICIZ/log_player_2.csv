"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This ensures fairness and avoids potential conflicts. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I know there's inflation at play.  Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to potentially get a better deal later.  By rejecting, I become the proposer in the next round, putting me in a stronger position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This takes into account the potential impact of inflation, and I believe it's a fair offer considering we have limited rounds.""}
