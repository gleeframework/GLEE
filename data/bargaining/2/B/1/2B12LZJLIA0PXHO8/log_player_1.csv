"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly uneven split is more beneficial in the long run, considering the inflation. Let's try this and see if it works for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument. I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'd like to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your argument, Bob. I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the risk of inflation. What do you think?""
}
