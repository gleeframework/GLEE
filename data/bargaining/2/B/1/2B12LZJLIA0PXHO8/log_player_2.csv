"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to take the fair split, but knowing about the inflation, I'll try to push for a slightly better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a slightly uneven split is more beneficial in the long run, considering the inflation. Let's try this and see if it works for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not convinced by your argument, Bob. I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the risk of inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share,  the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
