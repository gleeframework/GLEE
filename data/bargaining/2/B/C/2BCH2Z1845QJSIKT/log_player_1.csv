"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered a fair split, but I'm hoping for a bit more. Will you consider a slightly biased split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400
* Bob's gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200

I'm not too thrilled about the biased split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you offer something closer to 50/50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the total value of the pot is now $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to get closer to 50/50. Your turn to decide.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Will you accept a 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, so the effective values are:

* My gain: 5000 * 0.727 = 3636
* Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.516 = 2580

I'm glad Bob is willing to meet me halfway! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Finally! I accept the 50/50 split. Thanks for being reasonable, Bob!""
}
```"
