"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This offer is a fair starting point, giving me a slight advantage due to the inflation rates. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even considering inflation.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to stick with a slight advantage for myself, but I'm lowering my initial offer a bit to acknowledge Bob's rejection. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving up on getting a fair share."
