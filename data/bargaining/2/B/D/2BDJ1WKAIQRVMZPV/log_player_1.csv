I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  I'm hoping this is a good enough deal for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $2,800 and keep $7,200 for myself.  This is still a good deal for me, even with the 20% inflation.  I'm hoping that Bob will accept, as he's probably feeling the pressure of inflation too."
