Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money's value has decreased due to inflation, but the exact current value isn't directly relevant to making an offer, as the goal is to divide the $100 in a way that both players can agree on.

### Step 2: Analyze previous offers and rejections
Alice initially offered a 50/50 split, which was rejected. Then, I offered a 60/40 split in my favor, which Alice also rejected. In Round 3, Alice offered a 45/55 split, slightly increasing my share, but I rejected it.

### Step 3: Determine the strategy for the next offer
Given the pattern, it seems that Alice is willing to compromise but wants to ensure she gets a significant share. Since I rejected her slightly increased offer, I should now make an offer that is more favorable to her than my previous one but still benefits me.

### Step 4: Decide on the new offer
Considering the rejections and the need to find a middle ground, I will offer a 55/45 split in my favor. This is less than my previous demand of 60% but still higher than Alice's last offer of 45% for me.

### Step 5: Craft a message to accompany the offer
The message should acknowledge the compromise and encourage Alice to accept, emphasizing the mutual benefit of ending the game sooner rather than later due to inflation.

### Step 6: Finalize the offer and message
Offer: 55% for me (Bob), 45% for Alice.
Message: ""Let's meet in the middle and end this before the money loses more value. This way, we both get a fair share.""

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and end this before the money loses more value. This way, we both get a fair share.""}"
