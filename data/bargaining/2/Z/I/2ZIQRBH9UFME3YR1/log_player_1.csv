"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This is a generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we have 11 more rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much just yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than it initially seems. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 700,000, I'll try to counter with a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'm taking a bigger share this time!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000, which is a smaller share than in my initial offer, but still a decent deal considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a worse deal for me than it initially seems. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

However, I'm not impressed with the offer, and I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 650,000, I'll try to counter with an even more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to split it 50/50, Bob! Let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 500,000, which is a 50/50 split. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
