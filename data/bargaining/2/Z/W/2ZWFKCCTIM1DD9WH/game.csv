9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work out a better deal later.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"That's a bit ridiculous, don't you think? How about we go 60/40 in this round?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Let's try to be reasonable. I'll go down to 70%, but I won't go lower. It's not worth it for me to continue with this much inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, let's be real. 70/30 is not going to work. I'm proposing 45/55 - it's a much fairer split considering the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's close this deal.",Bob,4,
