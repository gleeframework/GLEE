"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's a bit ridiculous, don't you think? How about we go 60/40 in this round?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable. I'll go down to 70%, but I won't go lower. It's not worth it for me to continue with this much inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The decreasing value of the money makes each round more critical for me (Bob) than Alice. I need to push for a more equitable split while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be real. 70/30 is not going to work. I'm proposing 45/55 - it's a much fairer split considering the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's close this deal.""}"
