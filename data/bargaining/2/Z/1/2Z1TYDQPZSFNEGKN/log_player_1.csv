"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm willing to give Bob a significant portion of the money to start, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
