"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your cut last round was too greedy for me. Let's be a bit more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it now, or risk the money shrinking further for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
