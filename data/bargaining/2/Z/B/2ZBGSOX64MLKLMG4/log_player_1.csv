Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, giving us both $5,000 each."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. While Bob's offer is generous in the sense that he's giving me a larger share than he has to, I'm not thrilled about getting only $2,000.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was to give me a relatively small share, I'll try to negotiate a better deal this time. Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bigger share for taking the risk of negotiating with you.""

# Bob's message: You'll get a decent share, but I'm still in control 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to maintain control of the negotiation. While I'm not thrilled about getting only $4,000, it's still a decent offer.
