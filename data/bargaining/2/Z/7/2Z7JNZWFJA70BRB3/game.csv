480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer, but we need to factor in the time pressure as well. 52-48 is a strong offer, and it benefits us to wrap this up sooner rather than later.",Bob,4,

570000.0,430000.0,"I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. 57-43 is my new offer, considering the increasing inflation impact on your side.",Alice,5,
