Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a fairly large share for me early on. I'm aware of the inflation, but I want to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation.  The risk of rejecting and getting nothing is too high."
