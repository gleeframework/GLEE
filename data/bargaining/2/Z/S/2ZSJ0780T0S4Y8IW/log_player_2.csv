"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! Alice is trying to take almost everything. I'm confident I can get a much better deal as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, Bob.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not a good deal for me.  The inflation is working in my favor, and she'll be getting increasingly less with each round that passes. I'm willing to wait for a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7500,
""alice_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a very generous offer considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, Bob.  Let's end this before the inflation gets any worse. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal! Alice is finally willing to split the money evenly. It's important to accept now because while the inflation doesn't affect me, it's eating away at Alice's share, making her more likely to offer a fair deal."
