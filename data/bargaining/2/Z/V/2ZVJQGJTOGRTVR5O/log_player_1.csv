"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be friends""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. The message ""Let's be friends"" is a friendly gesture to start the negotiation on a positive note. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so I'm aiming for a slightly higher share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'm not willing to settle for an even split that gives me only $40, which is now equivalent to $36 due to inflation. I think I can still negotiate for a better share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $55 and keep $45 for myself. Considering the inflation, my $45 is now worth $36.45 (80% of the original value). I'll try to persuade Bob by pointing out that we're both losing value over time and that it's better to settle sooner rather than later.
