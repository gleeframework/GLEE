"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, I need to reassess my priorities. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more appealing now.

I'll accept the offer.
