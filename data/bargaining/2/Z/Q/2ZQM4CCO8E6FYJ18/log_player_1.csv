"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively even division of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, let's try to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to try to take a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer. The money I gain is worth the same as before, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80/20, I'll try to push the ratio a bit more in my favor. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You were too greedy last round, let's find a sweet spot!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the 60/40 I initially offered, but still not too extreme."
