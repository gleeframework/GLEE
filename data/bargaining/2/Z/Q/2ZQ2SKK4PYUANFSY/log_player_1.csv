"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start enjoying our respective shares!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to reassess Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the effective values:

My share: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's share: 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000 (due to 10% inflation)

Considering the reduced values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn to make an offer again. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation:

My share: 500,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484, since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, or 0.512, but 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%, or 0.729, for Bob's share, but for Alice's share it is 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, or 0.512, so I use 1 - 0.512 = 0.488, or 48.8% less, or 0.516) = 258,000
Bob's share: 500,000 * 0.729 = 364,500

Considering the reduced values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the continued inflation, my share is worth even less. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal split, $500,000 each. Let's see if he'll finally accept!"
