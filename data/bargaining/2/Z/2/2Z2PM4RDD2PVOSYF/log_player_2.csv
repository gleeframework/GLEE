**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the gap is closing, I need to hold out for a better deal.  Time pressure is mounting, but accepting a poor deal this early would be a mistake."

# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is blatantly playing on my fear of inflation.  While my position is weakening, accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to even a slightly better split in a later round. I need to show some backbone and hope she starts taking me seriously."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly content to let inflation eat away at my potential gain.  Offering a slight concession while conveying a sense of urgency might be enough to sway her.  If she rejects this, the remaining rounds will likely involve accepting increasingly worse deals due to the time pressure."

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough pill to swallow, but Alice is right - time is my enemy now. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. Accepting this offer cuts my losses. Waiting any longer risks getting even less in the end."
