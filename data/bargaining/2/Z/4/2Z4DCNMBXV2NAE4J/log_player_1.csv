"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll recalculate my gain:

50% of the current value of $100 is $50.

However, since the money is worth 5% less, the actual value of my gain is $50 / 0.95 = $52.63.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
