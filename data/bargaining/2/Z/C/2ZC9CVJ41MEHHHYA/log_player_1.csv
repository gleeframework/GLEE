Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  It's a risky move, but I figure if I get a good deal now, I can take advantage of the inflation later!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to take more, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy at this point. Inflation is hitting me hard, and if I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round. It's a fair split, and I'll avoid losing more money to inflation."
