"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority, but still a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take a slight majority, eh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I want to give Bob a 7:3 split, that's too uneven. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my previous offer. Still a fair split, but with a slight edge for me.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $500, but still keeping the split relatively close. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to compromise, but still thinks he deserves a bit more, huh?

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I want to give Bob a 6:4 split, that's still too uneven. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think I deserve a slight majority. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $500 from my previous offer, and giving Bob a 4:6 split. This is my most generous offer yet, let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up that much more, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet in the middle, huh?

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 55:45 split is still a bit uneven, but it's the closest we've gotten so far, and it's getting late in the game. I think I'll take this offer and end the game."
