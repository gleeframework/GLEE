"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is now 60-40, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Round 3

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable deal to Bob, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."

# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll on Bob's offer. With the money worth 27.1% less for Bob, his offer is actually a better deal for me than it was in the previous round.

I'll accept this offer.
