"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90/10. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. I think this is a fair start, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to give you the whole thing. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 0.9 * 400,000 = 360,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
