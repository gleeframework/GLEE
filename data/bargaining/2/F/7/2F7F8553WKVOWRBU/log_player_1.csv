"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you'll get 10%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent chunk of money, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. Let's try a more balanced split this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to be more generous this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. How about we meet in the middle?""
}
```

This way, we're closer to a 50-50 split, and I'm showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze in a bit more for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him a 55-45 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing for him due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating for a better deal."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, Bob, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you can do better than this.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

}
```
