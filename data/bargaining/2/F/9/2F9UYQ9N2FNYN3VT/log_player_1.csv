"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if the 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to get a good deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but I'm still trying to get a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get a better deal, but I think 60/40 is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll on my potential gain, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving up 60% of the remaining value, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get a decent amount for myself to make this worth my while.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and getting a reasonable amount for myself, considering the impact of inflation."
