"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40% 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's early in the game, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the value of my time and effort.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's make a deal before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think a 60/40 split is more fair, the clock is ticking, and the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'd rather have a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
