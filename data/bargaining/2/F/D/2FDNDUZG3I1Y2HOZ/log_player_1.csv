"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the value of my time and effort. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject this offer, since I think I can do better. The inflation effect is starting to hurt, and I'd like to get a better deal before it's too late.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is starting to bite! The money is worth 10% less than it was in the first round. I need to act quickly.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's make a deal before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal than before, but I'm still trying to keep the upper hand."
