"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 4000 dollars, but it's actually worth 80% of its original value due to inflation.

In that case, the effective value of my gain is 3200 dollars. Meanwhile, Bob gets 6000 dollars, which is still worth 100% of its original value.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is not as good as my initial proposal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself to account for the ongoing inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 4500 dollars, but it's actually worth 51.2% of its original value due to inflation.

In that case, the effective value of my gain is 5144 dollars. Meanwhile, Bob gets 5500 dollars, which is still worth 100% of its original value.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is not as good as my initial proposal. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a higher amount to myself to account for the ongoing inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 67.23% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 5800 dollars, but it's actually worth 32.77% of its original value due to inflation.

In that case, the effective value of my gain is 3264.76 dollars. Meanwhile, Bob gets 4200 dollars, which is still worth 100% of its original value.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is still not as good as my initial proposal. However, I'm starting to run out of time and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll accept this offer.
