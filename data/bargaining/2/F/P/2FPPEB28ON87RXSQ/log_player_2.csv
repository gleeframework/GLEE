Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 65% and you can have 35%. We can't keep going back and forth like this.  
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially with the inflation working against me more.  I need to push for a more significant split in the next round."
