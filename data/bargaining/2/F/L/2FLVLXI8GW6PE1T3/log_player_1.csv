"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer in the first round, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and make a counteroffer. I'll be sure to keep the inflation in mind as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my initial offer, but I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'm confident I can still get a better deal, especially since his offer has lost value due to inflation. I'll try to make a counter-offer that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a split that's more favorable to me. I'm aiming for a 70/30 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation, and I believe it's a reasonable offer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still not satisfied.  I've lost a significant amount of value due to inflation, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still reflects the value loss due to inflation.  I hope Bob will recognize that the game is getting shorter, and it's in his best interest to accept an offer before the value drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With inflation hitting both of us hard, and only six rounds remaining, it's time to be pragmatic.  Bob's offer is close to a 50/50 split, which is a significant improvement from his previous offers. I'm accepting this offer to secure a portion of the money before it completely evaporates due to inflation."
