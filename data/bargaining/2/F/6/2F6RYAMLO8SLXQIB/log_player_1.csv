"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a 20% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm taking the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest way to start, and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, my share of $500,000 is now worth $400,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's proposal is the fairest way to start, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the value of the money is decreasing.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less due to inflation, my target is to get as much as possible in the current round.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share to make up for the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share of the current $1,000,000. I'm taking the remaining 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice.  Inflation is a factor, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to take a slight cut from the even split, but I need a fair share too. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth $206,400.

I'm not sure if this offer is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the value of the money is decreasing.

However, I also don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer.
