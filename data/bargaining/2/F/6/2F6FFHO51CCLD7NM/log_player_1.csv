"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  It's highly unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets a clear precedent that I'm willing to be aggressive.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the end. I'll take it."
