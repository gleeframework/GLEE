This is a classic game theory problem! I'm going to start by being greedy and taking almost everything.  Let's see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep taking the majority of the money, it's clear that Bob is willing to play hardball.  Since the inflation only hurts him, I'm better off taking the 80 now rather than risk a lower offer in a future round.  Let's see if we can keep this up!"
