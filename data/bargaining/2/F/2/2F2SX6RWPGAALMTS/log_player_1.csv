Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer.  I'll keep 90% and offer Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal in the first round,  before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, I'm happy to accept a 50/50 split. It's better than losing more money due to inflation and risking getting an even worse offer in the next round."
