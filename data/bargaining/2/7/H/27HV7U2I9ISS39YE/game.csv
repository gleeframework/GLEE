550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt at fairness, but it seems we have different ideas about what's reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise, so I'll take the split you offered me last round, but with the amounts reversed. $550,000 for me, $450,000 for you.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,3,

512500.0,487500.0,"Bob, I'm acknowledging your willingness to compromise, but we need to find a middle ground quickly. I'm proposing a split right down the middle of our previous offers: $512,500 for me and $487,500 for you. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure from inflation. Let's wrap this up!",Alice,5,
