"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is fairer considering the inflation. Let's settle this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation. I'm willing to compromise, but you need to meet me halfway. This offer accounts for the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives you a good deal considering the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's be practical.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  This is my final offer - it's a fair split considering the inflation is impacting us both. Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Waiting any longer will significantly reduce his potential gain, even if he gets a slightly better offer.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. There's a good chance she won't budge further, and Bob risks getting nothing if they run out of rounds.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, the pressure is on. Accepting now secures something, which is better than the risk of getting nothing at all."
