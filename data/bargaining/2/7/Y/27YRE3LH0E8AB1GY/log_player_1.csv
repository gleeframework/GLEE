Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I want to ensure we both get a fair share. This way we can both maximize our gains before inflation hits hard. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
