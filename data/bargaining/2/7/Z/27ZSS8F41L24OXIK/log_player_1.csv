"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by proposing a very uneven split. I figure Bob will likely reject this offer, which will give me the chance to make a more equitable offer in the next round.  I'll aim for a more fair division while keeping in mind the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still very uneven, the inflation factor significantly reduces the value of Bob's offer to me. I'll take what I can get at this point, as the potential for further inflation in future rounds is a risk I'm not willing to take."
