"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives Alice 60% and Bob 40% of the money.  It's a reasonable starting point, as it's not too greedy, but it still gives Alice a significant advantage. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and is offering a much smaller share than he initially proposed.  I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'll propose a 50/50 split this time.  Bob rejected my initial offer, and with inflation biting, we both need to be more realistic to come to an agreement.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting even more greedy, offering a smaller share despite the inflation. I'll continue to reject his offers until he's willing to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500} 
```

I'm going to propose a slightly more even split, but still giving Bob a slight advantage. Inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to be more flexible. Let's see if this convinces Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting even more unreasonable. I refuse to accept such a small share, especially with inflation eroding the value of the money. I'm going to make a final attempt to reach a reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to concede a bit more to Bob, but I won't accept anything less than 4000.  The inflation is severe, and we both need to agree to something before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is outrageous. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation and leave me with next to nothing. I will not accept this.  This game is a stalemate, and we both lose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

I'm willing to go a bit lower, but this is the absolute minimum I will accept. The inflation is crippling, and I'm not giving in any further. It's now or never."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is beyond insulting.  This is just a power play, and I refuse to be taken advantage of.  With this much inflation, both of us are going to walk away with nothing, and it's all because Bob couldn't be reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}
```

This is it. My final offer. I'm willing to concede a bit more to Bob, but I won't go lower. We are both losing money rapidly with the inflation, and if we don't agree, it's over. I hope Bob has come to his senses by now."
