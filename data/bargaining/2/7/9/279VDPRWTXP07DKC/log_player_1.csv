"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the initial offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still in a position of power. It's true that my share is worth less now, but his share is worth even less. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 850,000 for myself and 150,000 for Bob.  Inflation has hit my share harder, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a larger portion. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a bit dicey. My share has lost a significant amount of value, and even though Bob's offer is still tilted in his favor, I can't afford to risk another round.  My share will be significantly lower if I reject.  I'll accept and cut my losses."
