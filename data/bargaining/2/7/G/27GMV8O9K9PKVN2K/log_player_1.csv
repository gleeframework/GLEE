"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is the best I can get.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30/70, I'm going to try to do better. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split, hoping to get a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much more!""}

I'm offering a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer is still a bit too favorable to him, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think carefully and...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to do better again. Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll aim for a slightly more even split.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's time to wrap this up!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the same as my initial offer in round 1. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in ending the game with a fair split."
