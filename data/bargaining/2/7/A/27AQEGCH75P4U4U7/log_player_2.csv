Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the value of her potential winnings plummets.  While her offer is closer to the middle, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of her share.  We can likely push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
