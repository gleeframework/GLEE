"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a better deal. It's still early in the game, and I can afford to be a bit more greedy.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the money will depreciate faster for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a reasonable split considering the depreciation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice has lowered her offer, and I'm getting a slightly better share.  I'm happy to take this deal, as it's unlikely she'll offer anything better in the next round."
