"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation rate and the previous offers, I suggest a 60:40 split. This maintains a balance while reflecting the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round. I hope this proposal is more acceptable.
