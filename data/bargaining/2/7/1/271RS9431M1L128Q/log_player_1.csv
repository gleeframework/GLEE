Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as the first proposer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I'm losing a substantial amount of money compared to my initial proposal, it's better to accept this 50/50 split than risk getting nothing in a later round."
