"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I proposed.""
}
```

This offer slightly favors Alice, which is reasonable given she's the first to propose. This strategy aims to:

* **Appear reasonable:** A near-even split avoids seeming overly greedy.
* **Establish a benchmark:** Future offers can be compared to this initial split.
* **Account for inflation:**  Delaying means less money for both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical Alice. It's my turn to propose now, and the clock is ticking.  
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer simply reverses the initial proposal, taking advantage of the time pressure and inflation. While accepting would still give Alice a significant sum, rejecting sends a message:

* **Not easily bullied:** Alice shows she won't be pressured into a disadvantageous deal just because it's Round 2.
* **Understanding the game:**  Rejecting demonstrates awareness that Bob might be willing to concede more as the game progresses and the stakes (due to inflation) get lower.

By rejecting, Alice forces Bob to reconsider his strategy and potentially offer a more appealing deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but let's not waste time. This offer considers the time lost to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  Alice shows a willingness to compromise after rejecting Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic Concession:** By slightly increasing Bob's share (compared to Round 1), Alice signals flexibility. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message subtly reminds Bob that  inflation is hurting them both.

This offer aims to:

* **Encourage a deal:** The slightly improved offer for Bob might be enough to entice him to accept.
* **Maintain an advantage:** Alice still secures a larger share, acknowledging her initial proposer status. 
* **Avoid further losses:**  Each round diminishes the value of the money, making a quick resolution desirable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, and we are both losing out. I'm offering a slight advantage, let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer still favors him, several factors make acceptance prudent:

* **Significant Inflation:** The money is now worth less than half its initial value. Further delays significantly erode any potential gains.
* **Marginal Difference:** Bob's advantage is minimal (only $20,000). The risk of continuing outweighs the potential reward of a slightly better deal. 
* **Possible Stalemate:** If Alice rejects, there's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in Round 5. He might  propose a similar split, pushing the game into further inflation-ridden rounds.

Accepting at this point secures a reasonable sum for Alice, even if not ideal. It avoids the risk of ending up with even less if the game continues to drag on."
