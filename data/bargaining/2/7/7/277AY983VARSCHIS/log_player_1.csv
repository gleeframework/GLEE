Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids any potential for conflict. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000

Do you accept this offer?","{
