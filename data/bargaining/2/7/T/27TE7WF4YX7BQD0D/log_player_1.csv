Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 2:5 is a fair compromise considering the initial 10,000. Let's take a chance and see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
