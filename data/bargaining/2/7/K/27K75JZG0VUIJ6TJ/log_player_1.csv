"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting the value of our time. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks he's being generous with the 55/45 split!

I'm not convinced, though. I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I agree with your numbers, Bob. I think I deserve more than 45%. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less now. My offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. How about a 63/37 split? It's closer to what I think we both deserve.""
}
```"
