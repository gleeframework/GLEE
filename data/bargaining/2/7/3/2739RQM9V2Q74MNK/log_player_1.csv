Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want 6000 for myself. It's a fair deal, considering the money is worth less for you due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
