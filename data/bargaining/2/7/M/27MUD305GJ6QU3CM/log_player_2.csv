"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it seems fair, Bob can potentially get more by rejecting and proposing a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better with this split. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. We can both get a good amount, and avoid any further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While Bob could potentially get more by rejecting and proposing again, the risk of further inflation for Alice might lead her to accept a lower offer in the next round. This ensures Bob gets a good amount while minimizing the risk of losing more due to future inflation."
