"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $6,000, and Bob will get $3,200 (which is 20% less than $4,000).

My proposal in Round 1 was $8,000 for me and $2,000 for Bob, but now Bob is offering $6,000 for me and $3,200 for himself. This is a compromise, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob, hoping that this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, Alice. I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I really think I deserve more. Make a decision! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's offer is worth even less to him. Considering that the money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round for Bob, his offer of $5,000 is equivalent to $10,000 in the first round, which is a significant amount.

Given that I'm still getting $5,000, I think this is a reasonable offer. It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
