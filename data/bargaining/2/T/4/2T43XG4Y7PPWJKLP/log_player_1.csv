I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal. This leaves me with a good share, and we avoid potential inflation issues early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I proposed in the first round, even after considering inflation.  I'm confident I can do better, especially with the remaining rounds.  I'll hold out for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  The remaining rounds are getting shorter, so I want to ensure a deal before inflation becomes too significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still quite low, and the inflation is starting to have a real impact.  I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but only slightly.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. However, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can do better in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm making another small concession, hoping to entice Bob into accepting before inflation further diminishes my share.  We're running out of time, and I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the inflation is starting to bite. However, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can secure a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

We're getting very close to the end, and the inflation is really hitting hard now.  I'm going to offer a 50/50 split to Bob, hoping to secure a deal before we both lose everything."
