"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you get 30. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. Let's be reasonable and avoid unnecessary back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather not accept a split that's even more skewed towards Bob's gain. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gains more significantly, I'll try to make a stronger offer. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 51/49, I'll aim for a slightly better split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still need to secure a fair share. 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
