"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This ensures I get the majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a good deal for me. While the inflation has reduced the value of the money I'm getting, it's still a significant amount. It's also a 50/50 split, which is fair.  I'll accept the offer."
