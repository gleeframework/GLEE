Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, but let's be a bit more equitable considering the decreasing value. This offer accounts for the time sensitivity. 
# Alice gain: 5025 
# Bob gain: 4975 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5150,
""bob_gain"": 4850,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money in this game.  Let's settle closer to the middle ground before this drags on.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about time, but fairness is important too. This is my final offer that reflects the time pressure while still striving for a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 5049 
# Bob gain: 4951 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses for Bob due to inflation, making it less likely he'll offer a better deal. We're already in round 4, and holding out for a slightly larger gain might backfire if Bob's offers trend downwards."
