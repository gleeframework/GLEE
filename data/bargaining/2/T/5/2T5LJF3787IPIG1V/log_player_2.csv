Let's see what kind of offer I can get!"

I'm going to try to be a little greedy here. Let's see if I can get a better deal than Alice offered me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's risky to keep rejecting offers. Alice is getting a better deal now due to inflation, and I'm not sure how much longer she'll keep playing this game. 500,000 is a good amount, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing at all."
