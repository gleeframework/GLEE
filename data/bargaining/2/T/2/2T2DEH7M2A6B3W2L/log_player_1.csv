"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a small portion, but I think 30 is a bit too low. I'd like to try to find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{
