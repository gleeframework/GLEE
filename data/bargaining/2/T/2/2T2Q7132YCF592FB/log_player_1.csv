I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems like a bad deal now, I know that if I reject it, I'll get to make the next proposal.  With inflation, I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to lower my demand slightly, but still aim for a significant share.  Inflation is working in my favor now, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept before the next round."
