Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 80-20, I'll get the bigger share for being the first to propose.""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, my gains are worth 20% less than in Round 1, so I'll be getting $6,400 (80% of $8,000).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to take only $6,400, I think I can do better than that.""
