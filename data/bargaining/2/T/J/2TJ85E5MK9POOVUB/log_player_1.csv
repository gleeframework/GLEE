**My offer:** I propose you take $900,000 and I take $100,000.  This is a generous offer, considering the inflation risk in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**My offer:** I propose you take $600,000 and I take $400,000.  While I'm willing to compromise, I need to ensure I receive a fair share after two rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

While the inflation has hurt me significantly, this offer is still better than the alternative.  I am likely to receive less in the next round, making this the most advantageous deal I can secure."
