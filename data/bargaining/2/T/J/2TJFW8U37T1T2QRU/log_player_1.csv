Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round! I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  Let's see if he's willing to accept that in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though I only get $1, it's better than nothing.  The inflation is likely to affect me more in future rounds, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
