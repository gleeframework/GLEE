Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to weigh the value of the $5,000 I'll get against the $5,000 Bob will get.

I'll decide to:

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is a bit more favorable than the previous one, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
