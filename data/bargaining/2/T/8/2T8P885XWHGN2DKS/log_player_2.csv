"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can always adjust it later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a tough start! 90/10 is pretty lopsided, and I have plenty of rounds to try and get a better deal.  Let's see if I can negotiate something closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, right?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll give you a little more, but 50/50 isn't happening.  I'm still the one taking the inflation hit, remember? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still being pretty unfair, and I'm not convinced her inflation argument is strong enough to justify such a large difference. I'm going to keep pushing for a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 45/55 split is fairer considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient.  Let's get this done.  70/30 is a fair deal considering the inflation you're facing. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is pushing her luck!  70/30 is way too lopsided, even considering the inflation.  I'll keep trying to get a better deal.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up 30% of the money just because of inflation. 40/60 is a reasonable compromise.  Let's wrap this up.""}
