"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point. It allows for negotiation and hopefully, a mutually acceptable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, this offer is fair and ensures that I get something. Given the risk of inflation and the possibility of getting nothing in later rounds, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice."
