```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to give Bob a good chunk of the money to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a last-ditch effort to get a good deal. With the money being worth so little, I'll offer a smaller share to myself, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid going home with nothing. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm essentially offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will take it to avoid a worse outcome. Your turn, Bob!"
