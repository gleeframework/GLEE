Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  I'm aiming for a more agreeable split this time. This offer accounts for the time value and gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, the value is decreasing for both of us. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be realistic - my offer is more than generous considering the time pressure. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly more appealing with each round as the value decreases for him significantly more than for me. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas continued rejection risks an even lower offer in the future."
