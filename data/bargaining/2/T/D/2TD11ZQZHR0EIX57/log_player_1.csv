"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my effective gain would be 0.9 * 500000 = 450000.

For Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so his effective gain would be 0.8 * 500000 = 400000.

Considering the reduced values, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to round 2.

My previous offer was 450,000, so I'll increase it slightly to account for the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values of the money in round 4.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, the total reduction from the first round is 1.1^3 = 1.331 (round 1 to round 3) * 1.1 (round 3 to round 4) = 1.4641. So, my effective gain in round 4 would be 0.4641 * 700000 = 324,887.

For Bob, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so the total reduction from the first round is 1.2^3 = 1.728. Then, an additional 20% reduction from round 3 to round 4, so the total reduction is 1.728 * 0.8 = 1.3824. Therefore, Bob's effective gain in round 4 would be 0.3824 * 300000 = 115,520.

Considering the reduced values, I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob compared to the first round.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, the total reduction from the first round is 1.1^4 = 1.4641. So, my effective gain in round 5 would be 0.4641 * 700000 = 324,887.

I'll make a new offer, considering the reduced value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```"
