Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a fair offer, and the money is losing value fast. I'll take it!"
