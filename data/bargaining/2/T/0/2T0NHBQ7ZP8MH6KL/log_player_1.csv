"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly and avoid any potential disputes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving you 60, that's too much""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You can take the majority, but I'm not giving you all""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping some leverage to negotiate further."
