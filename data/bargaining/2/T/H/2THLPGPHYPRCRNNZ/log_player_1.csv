"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than nothing, especially considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better split, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something. With the inflation rate,  waiting for another round might result in a worse outcome."
