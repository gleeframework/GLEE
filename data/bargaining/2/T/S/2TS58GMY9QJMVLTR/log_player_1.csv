Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, considering the inflation we'll be dealing with, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable.  Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
