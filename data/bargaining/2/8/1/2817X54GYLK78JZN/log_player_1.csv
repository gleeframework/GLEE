"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the larger share, but I'll have to think carefully about it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

This is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, trying to get a bit more for myself while still being reasonable."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offers are getting more and more skewed towards his favor. I need to think carefully about this one.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a bit more skewed towards my favor, but still a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offers are getting more and more one-sided. I need to think carefully about this one.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with only $3000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Since Bob's offers have been getting more and more one-sided, I'll try to take a bigger share this time. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

This is a bit of a risk, but I think I can get away with it. Let's see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with only $2500. This is getting ridiculous. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'm not going to back down now. I'll make a final, strong offer to try to get a fair deal. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}

This is a bit of a risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share after rejecting all of Bob's previous offers. Let's see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting absurd! Bob's offers are now leaving me with less than 20% of the total amount. I've had enough of his games.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with only $2000. I'll stick to my guns and reject this offer. It's time for me to make the final offer.

(Remember, we have only 2 rounds left to reach a deal or walk away with nothing.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","It's time to make a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer. I'll try to get as close to an equal split as possible, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's previous offers. Here's my final proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and reasonable offer. If Bob accepts this, we can finally reach a deal. If he rejects it, we'll both walk away with nothing. The choice is his."
