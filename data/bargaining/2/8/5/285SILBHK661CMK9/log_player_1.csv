"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. I think this is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $50 in this round is equivalent to $55 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still leaving you with a decent share. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increasing inflation, my gain of $40 is equivalent to $33.33 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'd rather aim for a larger share.

However, Bob's offer is not bad, and it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer to get a larger share than my previous offer.
