Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation you'll experience in the next round. Let's get this done!

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go up to 60/40.  We both need to be flexible to get this done before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is offering more, it's still heavily in his favor.  We need to hold out for a better deal while the rounds allow.  The inflation hit is significant, but not yet dire."
