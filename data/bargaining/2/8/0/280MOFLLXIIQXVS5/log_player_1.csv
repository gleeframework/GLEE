"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself.  This will be a good starting point to see how Bob reacts and whether he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, the inflation makes it less attractive for me to reject. Accepting this offer means getting at least something, while rejecting it means risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
