"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness proposal, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the first to propose. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a fair split, but wants a bit more for being the first to propose.

However, I'm not convinced that I should give up 50% of the remaining $100. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the previous round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 50% of the remaining value.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 45%. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more than 45% of the remaining value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

Considering the effects of inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round. Given that the money is worth less, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share.
