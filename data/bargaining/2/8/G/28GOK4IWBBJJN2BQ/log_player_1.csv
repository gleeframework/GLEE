"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have the majority, but I'll take a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping to get a bit more than 60% of the initial $100, and Bob's offer of 70% is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 75/25, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the initial $100, which is $75, and Bob gets the remaining 25%, which is $25."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get left with nothing 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of 80/20. Although I was hoping to get a bit more, I'm not sure if we'll be able to come to a better agreement, and I don't want to risk losing out on a significant amount of money. I'll take the 80% and call it a day."
