""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. The value of the money is declining rapidly, and this 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the remaining funds. We both have a lot to lose if we continue this game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
