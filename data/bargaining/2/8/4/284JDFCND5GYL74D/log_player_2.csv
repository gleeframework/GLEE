Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the value of the offer in real terms. In this case, Alice is offering me 45 units of money that are worth 9.75% less than the original 50 units, which means I'd be getting approximately 45.38 units in real terms. However, I still have the option to make another proposal, so I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money I gain. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}"
