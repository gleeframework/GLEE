Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 68/32 split in my favor.  Given the rapid devaluation, any further delays will only hurt you more than me. This offer ensures you get a decent share while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 320000 
# Bob gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
