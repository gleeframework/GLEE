Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. The money is depreciating quickly, and this is the fairest way to ensure we both get something. If you reject this, we'll be fighting over shrinking pieces of the pie. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

While I could try to negotiate for more, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:**  The money is losing value quickly, especially for Alice. Every round that passes makes her more desperate, increasing the chances of her accepting a less favorable deal later.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting now guarantees me a significant sum. Holding out for a slightly larger share risks ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time. 
* **Fairness:** While I could argue for a larger share, a 50/50 split is undeniably fair, especially given the time pressure. 

It's better to walk away with a guaranteed, albeit slightly smaller, win than risk losing everything."
