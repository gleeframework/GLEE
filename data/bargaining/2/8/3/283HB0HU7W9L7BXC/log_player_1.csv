"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets $0. This is a pretty straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a moderate offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a reasonable one, and it's a good starting point for negotiations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, and see how the game unfolds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
