9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate more in the following rounds if you want.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. It's fair and leaves room for more negotiation later. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split.  Let's do 60/40, with me getting 60% this round.  We can keep negotiating after that.",Alice,3,
