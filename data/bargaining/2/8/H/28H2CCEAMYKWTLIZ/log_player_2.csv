"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate more in the following rounds if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair in the first round, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting and proposing my own offer gives me a chance to get a larger share before the money loses its value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. It's fair and leaves room for more negotiation later. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split.  Let's do 60/40, with me getting 60% this round.  We can keep negotiating after that. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is reasonable and gives me a significant share, especially considering the potential inflation impact on Alice's gains. It's a good strategy to accept this and see how negotiations play out in the following rounds."
