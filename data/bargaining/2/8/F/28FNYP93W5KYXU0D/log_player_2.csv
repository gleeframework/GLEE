Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, and I'm willing to compromise. However, 60/40 is too drastic considering the inflation. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500
