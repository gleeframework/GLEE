"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share of the original $1,000,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, even if the money is losing value. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is losing value, I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept the even split, as I think I should get a slightly larger share to account for the 5% less value my gain will lose to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is losing value at different rates for each of us, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a 45% share of the original $1,000,000, but I'm hoping he'll accept it before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal than last time. We both need to make sure we get a reasonable share before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm getting a fair deal, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, especially since the money is worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob. I'd like to try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to act quickly. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 475k, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation. It's now or never!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $475,000, which is a 52.5% share of the original $1,000,000, but I'm hoping he'll accept it before the value of the money drops even further."
