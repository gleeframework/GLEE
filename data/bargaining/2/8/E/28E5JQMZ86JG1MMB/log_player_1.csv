Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob will be happy to get anything, and I'll get the lion's share. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a good amount. And Bob's offer is a lot fairer than my first one. It's a good deal, let's take it!"
