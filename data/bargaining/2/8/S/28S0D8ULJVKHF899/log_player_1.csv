"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 10% and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000$ and keeping 900,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to recalculate the actual value of the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll consider the effective value of the offer to be:

Alice gain: 500,000 x 0.8 = 400,000
Bob gain: 500,000 x 0.8 = 400,000

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's 50/50 offer because it doesn't take into account the inflation effect. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation effect:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, but I need more for myself.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping 70% of the remaining value (after inflation) and offering Bob 30%. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take most of it this time! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is making a bold move!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer:

Alice gain: 200,000 x 0.516 (1 - 0.484 = 0.516, since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value remains) = 103,200
Bob gain: 800,000 x 0.516 = 413,280

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because the effective value I'd receive is still relatively low, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep some value.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping 60% of the remaining value (after inflation) and offering Bob 40%. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take what's left! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is mounting!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer:

Alice gain: 100,000 x 0.326 (1 - 0.673 = 0.327, since 100% - 67.23% = 32.77% of the original value remains) = 32,600
Bob gain: 900,000 x 0.326 = 293,400

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because the effective value I'd receive is extremely low, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering the further decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50000,
  ""bob_gain"": 950000,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, but I'll give you most of it.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping a small amount (5% of the remaining value) and offering Bob the majority of the remaining value. I'm framing it as a desperate attempt to salvage something, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
