"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this as a starting point, but we can always negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's early in the game, and I believe I can negotiate for more. Plus, with inflation, the money is worth the same to me in the next round, but it will be worth less to Alice. This gives me some leverage to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet somewhere closer to the middle. The inflation is on my side, but I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable solution.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice has increased the amount she's willing to give me, I believe I can still negotiate for more given the significant impact of inflation on her share. In the next round, her share will be worth even less, which could prompt her to offer a more favorable division to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take a larger portion. However, I'm still open to negotiations to ensure we both walk away with something.""}"
