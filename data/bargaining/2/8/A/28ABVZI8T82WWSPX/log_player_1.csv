"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 and give $1000 to Bob. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation will negatively affect me more than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I propose to keep $8500 and give $1500 to Bob.  I'm reducing my share to make the offer more attractive, but I still need to secure a significant portion to mitigate the inflation impact."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still significantly unfair. While I am facing inflation, I can still hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to try and reach a compromise. While inflation is hitting me hard, I'm willing to concede further to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfair, even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm willing to take a smaller share but I need to be able to cover at least a portion of the inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping to finally reach an agreement. Inflation is severely impacting me, but I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
