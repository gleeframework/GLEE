Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my diminishing returns due to inflation.  While she inches up her offer by a dollar each round, it's not enough to offset my losses over time.  I need to hold firm and hope she makes a significant move towards a more equitable split soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking with 50/50.  It's the fairest option, and we're running out of time.  Inflation is eating away at my share, so please reconsider.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While I want a fair 50/50 split, getting only $44 now is better than risking getting $0 in a few rounds if we don't reach an agreement. Alice is unlikely to budge further, and I need to secure something before the inflation makes even this offer terrible."
