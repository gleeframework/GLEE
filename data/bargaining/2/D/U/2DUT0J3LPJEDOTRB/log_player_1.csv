"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd be getting $400,000, which is a significant reduction from the original offer.

I'll consider Bob's proposal. Splitting the money evenly seems fair, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
