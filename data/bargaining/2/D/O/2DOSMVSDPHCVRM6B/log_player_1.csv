"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations and willing to consider Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 80 * 0.8 = 64
Bob's gain: 20 * 0.95 = 19

Bob's new offer is:
Alice gain: 45
Bob gain: 55

Since my gain in this offer is less than what I would get with the previous offer (64 > 45), and considering the message from Bob, I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 20% less than in the first round. My previous gain was 64, but now it's 64 * 0.8 = 51.2.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to meet Bob in the middle and end the game."
