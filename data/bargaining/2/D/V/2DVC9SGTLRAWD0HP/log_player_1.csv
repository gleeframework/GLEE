"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to trick me into accepting the same offer again!

I'll reject this offer since it's the same as the first one. The money is worth less now, but the ratio is still the same.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money.

I'll reject this offer since it's still not favorable for me. The ratio is still skewed towards Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering you $500,000 and keeping $500,000 for myself. This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
