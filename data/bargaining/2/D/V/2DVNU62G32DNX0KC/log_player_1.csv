"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script!

I'll think about it... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority for myself. Will Bob accept?"
