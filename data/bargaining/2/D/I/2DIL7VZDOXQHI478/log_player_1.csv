Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep almost all the money, giving Bob only $1. This is a very risky strategy, but if Bob rejects my offer, the money will be worth less in the next round, giving me an advantage.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I initially wanted to take a bigger share, the rapid inflation means that my proposed gain would be significantly less in the next round. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money, and I'd rather secure a win than risk getting nothing."
