Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, he's still trying to take the lion's share. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth.  I'm hoping he'll get more reasonable in the next round, otherwise, I might have to accept a less favorable offer soon."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and the money is shrinking. I'm meeting you halfway. Let's close this deal.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We've both lost enough to inflation. 50/50 is the only fair split now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's finally at a fair split, and with the inflation, waiting any longer will just result in less money for both of us."
