"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I'm only getting 20% of the remaining $100. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Trying to find a middle ground, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still gives him a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with the 40-60 split. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally agree on a split."
