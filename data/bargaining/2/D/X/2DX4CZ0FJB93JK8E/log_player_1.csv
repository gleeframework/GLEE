"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, let's try to get closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30:70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as concerned about the exact numbers.
