"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $8000 * 0.8 = $6400. However, the inflation adjustment on Bob's gain is 10% less, so $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000 * 0.9 = $3600.

My gain is now worth $6400, and Bob's gain is worth $3600. I'll accept this offer.
