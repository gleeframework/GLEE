"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 60/40, I'll take the bigger share this time, but we can adjust in the next round if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth $32 (80% of $40).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of the previous value, so my gain is now worth $20.80 (64% of $32.50).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
