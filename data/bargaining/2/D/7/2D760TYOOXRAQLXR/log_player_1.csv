I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation! I'll reject his offer and make my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep a significant majority. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and potential further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than in the previous rounds, but the inflation effect is significant. Even though he's keeping the majority, it's likely worth less to him than the initial offer. I'll accept and end this game."
