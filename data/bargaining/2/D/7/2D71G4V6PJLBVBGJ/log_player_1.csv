Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about inflation, but your initial offer was too low. This is a much fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even though Bob's offer acknowledges the impact of inflation, it's still not favorable in the long run. I need to aim for a larger share while the money holds more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7500,
""bob_gain"": 2500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this takes, the less we both get. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on much longer.  Meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally acknowledging the severity of the situation. While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I get something substantial before inflation eats away at the value further. It's a compromise, but a necessary one at this point."
