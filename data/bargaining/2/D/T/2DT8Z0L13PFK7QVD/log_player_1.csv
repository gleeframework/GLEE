"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive opening move, aiming to quickly secure the majority of the prize. I'm curious to see if Bob accepts or tries to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. This is a mirror image of my offer, and I am not going to accept a deal where I only get $1. I'm confident that I can do better in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us."
