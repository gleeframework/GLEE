Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me much faster than it is against her.  While her offer is significantly better than what I would get if I reject and we hit round 12 (almost nothing), I need to try and push for a more even split while there's still a decent amount of value left for me."

# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out and inflation is killing me. While Alice is still trying to take advantage, accepting now is better than risking getting an even worse offer, or worse, reaching round 12 and getting nothing."
