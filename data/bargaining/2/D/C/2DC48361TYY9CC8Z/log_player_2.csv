"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. A fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of money is decreasing for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for you with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the shrinking pie 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The value of the money is shrinking rapidly, and Alice's offer is becoming more appealing. It's better to take what I can get now."
