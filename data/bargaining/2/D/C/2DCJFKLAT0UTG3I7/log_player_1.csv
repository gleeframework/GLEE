"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  This leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, while still giving Bob a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better for me than the previous round, it still heavily favors Bob. I will reject and counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, recognizing that Bob's offer was unfavorable.  I believe a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation that has occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation has significantly impacted the value of my potential gains.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive something, which is better than risking further losses in the next round."
