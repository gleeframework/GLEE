Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice! I'm being generous considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer seems generous at first glance, it's important to remember that the value of the money decreases for me with each round. Holding out for a better offer is still the best strategy."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The inflation is hitting us both, Bob.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You know the money is losing value for you, Alice. I'm being reasonable here. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting dangerous, but Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  It's better to hold out a bit longer and hope he gets more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is cutting it close, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats up any more of the pie.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really taking a toll on your share, Alice. This is a good deal for you at this point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but it's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, and it's only going to get worse for me from here. Accepting his offer now at least guarantees me something instead of risking getting even less in future rounds."
