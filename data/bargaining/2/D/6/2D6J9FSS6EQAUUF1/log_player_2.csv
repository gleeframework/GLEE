"Round 1

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I understand the inflation is working against me, but your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This offer is much fairer while still acknowledging the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a decent share, and avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  You're pushing me to a point where accepting almost nothing will be better than continuing this charade. I'm willing to be generous, but this is my final offer.""}
