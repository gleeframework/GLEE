"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of the money I'll get if I accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get 40 dollars, which is worth 90% of the original 44 dollars I would have gotten in the first round.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of 60 dollars is worth 80% of the original 75 dollars he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering these effective values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
