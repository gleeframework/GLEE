"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 3000 is now worth 2400 in real terms (80% of 3000). Bob's gain of 7000 is still 7000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting less than in the previous round, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much""
}
