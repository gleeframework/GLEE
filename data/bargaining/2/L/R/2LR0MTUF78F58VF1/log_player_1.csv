**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally moving towards a more favorable split for himself, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor. By continuing to reject, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk reaching no deal at all to get a more equitable split. The time pressure (inflation) is a factor, but it also pushes Bob to make more significant concessions."
