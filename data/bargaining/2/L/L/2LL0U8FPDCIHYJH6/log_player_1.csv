"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe an even split is the fairest. This ensures we both benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me, but still fair considering the circumstances.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but the decreasing value necessitates a slight adjustment for me. This offer is still very close to an even split. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate due to the inflation heavily impacting his potential gains.  While his offer is close to even, I'm betting I can get a slightly better deal in the next round or two as the pressure mounts on him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this is a good deal for both of us considering the depreciation. Take it before it's too late!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer.  He's feeling the heat from the inflation, and this offer is designed to seem reasonable while still giving me a slight advantage. He might accept to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but the shrinking value makes it increasingly difficult. This offer accounts for the depreciation and still gives you a substantial share. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky now. While not ideal, this offer is still better than what Bob originally proposed, and waiting any longer could result in even worse offers from him as the inflation eats into his potential gains. It's time to secure a reasonable amount rather than risk getting nothing."
