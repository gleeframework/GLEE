"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I take $700,000, you get $300,000. This ensures you get something now, and we avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a quick $300,000 is tempting, the inflation will eat away at my potential gains in the long run. I'm better off seeing what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, a higher share now is better for me than waiting for a potential future offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure you're feeling with the inflation working against you. My new offer is $650,000 for me, and $350,000 for you. This is a significant amount of money for you and avoids further losses. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum. The inflation is now substantial, and further rounds risk significantly diminishing my potential gains."
