"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, a higher share now is better for me than waiting for a potential future offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
