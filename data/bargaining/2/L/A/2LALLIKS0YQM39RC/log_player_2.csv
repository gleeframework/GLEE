"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I think 60/40 is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer wasn't quite fair to me.  How about we try this split instead?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Round 1:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, signaling that I'm looking for a more balanced deal.

* **Round 2 Offer:**  
    * **Not too greedy:** I don't want to lowball Alice and risk her rejecting my offer out of spite.
    * **Time is a factor:** While a 50/50 split seems fair initially, the value of the money decreases faster for Alice. Offering her a slightly better deal now (55/45) might be more appealing to her than waiting for the money to be worth even less.
    * **Message:** The message aims to be polite but firm, indicating that I'm open to negotiation but not going to accept an unfair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time. I think we can both agree that's fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. While a 55/45 split in my favor would be ideal, waiting any longer risks a worse deal due to the rapid devaluation. 
* **Fair Offer:**  Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is genuinely fair. Holding out for a slightly larger share isn't worth the risk of the money depreciating further."
