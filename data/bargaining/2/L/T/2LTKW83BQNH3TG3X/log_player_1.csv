"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. Given the inflation rates, the money loses value with each round, but at different rates for each of us. This division seems fair considering the impact of inflation, as I'm losing value at a higher rate. It's a balanced offer that should encourage Bob to accept early on to maximize his gain before the value decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're concerned about inflation, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle? This offer is still generous considering the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Although Bob's offer attempts to meet closer to the middle, considering the inflation rates, accepting $45 in the second round means I'm actually getting less value than initially proposed due to the 20% decrease in value for me. It's strategic to reject this offer and propose a new division that takes into account the loss of value for both of us but still aims for a fairer distribution in my favor, given my higher rate of value loss."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's adjust the initial offer slightly to account for the loss in value, aiming for a mutually acceptable division""}\n\n### In this revised offer, I've adjusted the amounts slightly from the initial proposal, still aiming for a division that reflects the differing impacts of inflation on our gains. By proposing $58 for myself and $42 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a balance that could be acceptable to both, considering we both lose value with each passing round, albeit at different rates. This adjustment shows willingness to negotiate while still being mindful of the value depreciation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's time to be realistic. The value is disappearing quickly for both of us, but especially for you. This offer ensures we both walk away with something worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Although Bob's message emphasizes the urgency due to the quickly diminishing value, his offer of $40 for me and $60 for him doesn't adequately compensate for the significantly higher rate of value loss I'm experiencing. At this stage, accepting this offer would mean I'm agreeing to a division that doesn't fairly account for the 48.8% loss in value I've incurred, compared to Bob's 27.1% loss. It's crucial to continue negotiating for a more equitable distribution, considering the disparate impacts of inflation on our potential gains."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's factor in the actual loss of value for both and meet closer to a fair division, given the significant impact on my potential gain""}\n\n### In this offer, I'm taking into account the substantial loss of value I've experienced due to inflation (48.8% less) and proposing a division that still acknowledges Bob's loss but seeks a more balanced outcome. By suggesting $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, I'm attempting to adjust our shares in light of the actual value we're likely to receive, aiming for a more equitable agreement that reflects the current state of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer reflects the reality of our situation. The clock is ticking, and frankly, you're running out of time to secure a reasonable portion. Don't let the opportunity slip away. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Despite the pressure from Bob and the significant decrease in value for both of us, his offer of $35 for me and $65 for him still doesn't fairly account for the extreme loss of value I'm facing (67.23% less). Given the urgency and the fact that we're halfway through the rounds, it's critical to push for a division that more accurately reflects the current value situation. Accepting this offer would mean settling for a share that's disproportionately affected by inflation, without adequate compensation for the loss incurred. Rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action to achieve a more balanced outcome."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the drastic loss of value for both, especially for me, let's aim for a realistic division that still acknowledges the impact of inflation on our gains""}\n\n### In this proposal, I'm adjusting my previous offers to reflect the severe impact of inflation on the potential gains for both of us, particularly for me, having lost 67.23% of the value. By offering $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that is more reflective of our current situation. This division is a compromise, taking into account the significant loss in value and the limited rounds left for negotiation. It's a pragmatic approach, aiming for a mutually acceptable agreement before the value decreases further."
