"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and consider the inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's think about this strategically:

* **Inflation hurts Alice more:**  A 20% decrease in value for Alice is significant. The longer we wait, the less appealing any offer that heavily favors her will seem.
* **We have time:** 12 rounds is quite a lot.  Rushing into an agreement isn't necessary, and I'm willing to bet Alice will become more open to a fairer split as the rounds progress. 

Let's see what she proposes in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand you're concerned about inflation, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle? This offer is still generous considering the declining value."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards fairness:** This offer is a more balanced split of the money, reflecting that we are both losing value as time goes on.
* **Putting the pressure on Alice:** By offering a reasonable but not overly generous deal, we signal that we are serious about getting a decent share and are not afraid to let rounds pass. This might make Alice more willing to compromise in the next round if she rejects this offer."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, let's adjust the initial offer slightly to account for the loss in value, aiming for a mutually acceptable division 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging! While she's acknowledging the inflation, the adjustment is tiny. It seems like she's hoping I'll cave under the pressure of the shrinking pot. However, she's losing value far quicker than I am. Let's see if she gets more realistic in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to be realistic. The value is disappearing quickly for both of us, but especially for you. This offer ensures we both walk away with something worthwhile."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the tables:** I'm now mirroring the split Alice initially proposed, highlighting how the changing value dynamics make this more favorable for her than it might seem.
* **Strong but not unreasonable:**  While this offer leans more in my favor, it's not outrageously so.  There's still room for negotiation, and it shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of a fair deal.
* **Time pressure:** With each round, the 'fair' split shifts slightly in my favor. This offer emphasizes that Alice has more to lose than I do by dragging things out."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's factor in the actual loss of value for both and meet closer to a fair division, given the significant impact on my potential gain 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally starting to understand the impact of the inflation!  She's moving closer to a truly fair split. However, she's still trying to hold onto a slight advantage. 

We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is definitely on her now. I think I can get a slightly better deal if I hold out for another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer reflects the reality of our situation. The clock is ticking, and frankly, you're running out of time to secure a reasonable portion. Don't let the opportunity slip away."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:** This offer is a calculated risk, pushing my advantage slightly further than before.  However, the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's potential share makes it a powerful bargaining chip.
* **Direct and assertive:** The message is deliberately more assertive,  emphasizing the urgency of the situation for Alice. This could prompt her to accept a deal she might have rejected in earlier rounds.
* **Leaving room for a final counter:** While I'm pushing for a favorable split, I'm leaving some space for Alice to make one final counter-offer. This keeps the door open for agreement in case she's completely unwilling to accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the drastic loss of value for both, especially for me, let's aim for a realistic division that still acknowledges the impact of inflation on our gains 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is it, the tipping point.  While I'd prefer a bit more, Alice has made a significant jump from her previous offer. Accepting now guarantees a decent share before the inflation eats away too much more, especially from her side. It's a compromise, but a reasonable one at this stage of the game."
