Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be sensible, Bob. We're both losing money with every round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. This puts increasing pressure on her to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a better deal in later rounds carries significant risk. The potential gains for Bob shrink with each round due to inflation.
* **Risk of Losing it All:** If no agreement is reached by round 12, both players walk away with nothing. 

Accepting the 50/50 offer ensures Bob gets a reasonable share, rather than risking a worse outcome or even losing everything as the game progresses."
