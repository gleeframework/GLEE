### 
I'm not impressed by Alice's ""generous"" offer. It's still very one-sided, and I believe we can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make another proposal or see if Alice comes up with something more reasonable."

### 
Alice is getting frustrated, but her offer is still not satisfactory. I'll reject it and continue negotiating. We're only halfway through the rounds, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a better deal. Alice might get more desperate and offer a more reasonable split as the rounds go on."

# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
Alice claims this is her final offer, but I'm not convinced. She's been trying to strong-arm me into accepting an unfair deal from the start. I'll reject this offer and see if she's truly willing to walk away with nothing if she doesn't get her way. We still have a few rounds left, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a better deal. If Alice is bluffing, she might come back with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
