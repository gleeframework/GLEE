"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 980000,
""bob_gain"": 20000,
""message"": ""Let's be efficient, Bob. Take this generous offer and avoid further devaluation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  Alice starts by aiming high, maximizing her potential gain. This creates room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice highlights the impact of inflation on Bob's share. This incentivizes Bob to settle quickly rather than risk losing more value with each passing round.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While the offer heavily favors Alice, the message frames it as ""generous"" and focused on ""efficiency."" This might make Bob more receptive than if Alice appeared outright greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's end this game before the money devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly better than his potential gain in Round 1, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  Here's why Alice should reject:

* **Leveraging Inflation:** Time is on Alice's side.  With each round, Bob's potential share loses value. By rejecting, Alice increases the pressure on Bob to offer a larger portion in the next round.
* **Aiming for a Better Split:** Alice can reasonably expect to secure a deal closer to a 70/30 or even 80/20 split in her favor if she plays strategically.  
* **Calculated Risk:** While there's a small risk Bob becomes stubborn, his message suggests he's keen to avoid further devaluation. This implies he's willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for you in this game. My new offer is still generous and saves you from another round of devaluation. Let's be sensible and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand from 980,000 to 800,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a significant majority of the money.
* **Emphasize Time Pressure:**  Alice reminds Bob about the decreasing value of his potential earnings with each passing round. By highlighting the ""sensible"" nature of her offer, she subtly pressures him to accept.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** While compromising, Alice avoids a drastic drop in her demand. This signals that she's confident in her position and expects a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger risk, but I think this split is more reasonable. Let's end this game before the money devalues further. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to a more balanced split, Alice is still in a strong position to hold out:

* **Inflation Still Favors Alice:**  A 14.26% decrease for Bob is significant, but it's still a relatively small loss compared to the potential gains Alice is aiming for.
* **Bob's Increased Risk:**  Bob's message indicates he's becoming more aware of the impact of inflation.  This suggests he's likely to make a more substantial offer in the next round. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, Alice gauges how desperate Bob is to reach a deal. If he's truly concerned about devaluation, he'll make a more appealing offer next round. 

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to slightly adjust her expectations in the next round. While holding out is advantageous, she needs to avoid appearing completely inflexible, which could make Bob less willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. You've lost a significant chunk of your potential earnings already.  Take this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as her ""final offer,"" Alice aims to create a sense of urgency and limit further negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Alice drops her demand to 750,000, a noticeable decrease from her previous offer. This signals a willingness to compromise to close the deal.
* **Highlighting Losses:** Reminding Bob of his shrinking share due to inflation reinforces the downside of continued rejection.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While Alice could potentially push for more, there's a risk Bob becomes increasingly resistant. This offer balances potential gains with the need to secure a deal before Bob's share becomes too unattractive for him to accept."
