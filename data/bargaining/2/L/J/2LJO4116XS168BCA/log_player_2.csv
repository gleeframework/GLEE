# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing rapidly, accepting $20 for Bob is a terrible deal.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic. It's worth the risk to hold out and hope Alice becomes more reasonable or time pressure forces her hand."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers! 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough spot. While the value is plummeting, Alice is getting greedier. However, getting $0 is the worst outcome. There are only a few rounds left, and Bob needs to signal he's willing to accept something to avoid disaster.  Rejecting this keeps a sliver of hope that Alice will panic in the last round and offer something acceptable."

# Alice's message: This is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but there's no choice left.  Rejecting this offer means BOTH players get $0. Taking the measly $5 is better than nothing in this desperate situation. Alice played hardball and won."
