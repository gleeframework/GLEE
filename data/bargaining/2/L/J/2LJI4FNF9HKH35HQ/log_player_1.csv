"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems fair as I have to contend with a higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 55/45. While I still need to account for the higher inflation, I'm willing to give a bit more to incentivize Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially proposed, the inflation has greatly reduced the value of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, while rejecting it might lead to further losses due to inflation and potentially a worse offer in the next round."
