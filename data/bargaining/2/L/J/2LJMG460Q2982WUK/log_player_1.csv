"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm sure Bob will have some counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, Alice. Let's split it more evenly.  
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll carefully consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 0% less for me and 19% less for Bob, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%. I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a slightly better deal."
