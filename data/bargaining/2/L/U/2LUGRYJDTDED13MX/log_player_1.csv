"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept.

Please relay this to Bob and let me know his response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling the inflation pinch already. This is a better starting point for us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me, I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation, and I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is on your side... to concede""
}
```

Since Bob is feeling the pinch of inflation, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, increasing my share to 65% of the money. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm trying to nudge Bob into accepting this offer by pointing out that the inflation is affecting his side more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer before the money really loses its value. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not buying the ""last offer"" threat, and I think Bob is still feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'm not motivated to accept this offer, which is only slightly better than his previous one. I'll take my chances and see what happens in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time is on my side""
}\n\nSince Bob's share of the money is now worth almost half as much as it was initially, I'm feeling confident that I can get an even better deal. I'm increasing my share to 70% of the money, and my message is a reminder to Bob that the longer we play, the more the inflation hurts his side. I'm hoping he'll finally cave in and accept this offer."
