Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to give you a bigger share next round if you're willing to wait. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time. Don't expect it to last. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. While I'm getting less than I would have liked, the inflation is making the money worth less and less with each round. It's better to take something now than risk getting even less later."
