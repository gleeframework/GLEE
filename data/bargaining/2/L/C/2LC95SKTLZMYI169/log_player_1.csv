"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I think I'll accept this one. The reduced gain is still a decent share of the remaining money, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing more value due to inflation.
