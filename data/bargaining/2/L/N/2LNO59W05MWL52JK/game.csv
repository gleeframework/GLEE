5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, I understand you want a larger share.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 50/50 split. This offer gives you a decent gain while still ensuring I get a fair return.  Let's avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,3,

4875.0,5125.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a 48.75/51.25 split.  This is my final offer, accept it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's end this now with a simple 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option, and we can both walk away with a decent share.",Alice,5,
