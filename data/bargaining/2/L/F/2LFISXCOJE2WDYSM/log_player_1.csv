"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this over with, I'll take the whole $100 if you're okay with it.""
}
```

This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can end the game and avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable proposal from Bob this time!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for 50% yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really kicking in now!

Okay, let's think about Bob's offer...

I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up 40% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now!

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not going to get taken advantage of. Make a better offer or I walk.""
}
```

This is my best shot at getting a decent deal, considering the dwindling value of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I need something too. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

Okay, let's think about Bob's offer...

I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up 30% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

However, I'm starting to get a bit worried that we might not be able to reach a deal before the 12-round limit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really ravaging the value of the money now!

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, and I'm not going to get any more generous. Take it or leave it, but don't expect me to give up more.""
}
```

This is my best shot at getting a decent deal, considering the almost worthless value of the money at this point!"
