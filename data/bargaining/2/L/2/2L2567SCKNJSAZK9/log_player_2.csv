"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""My turn to propose something. This offer heavily favors me, but if you reject it, things will get worse for you next round. Think carefully!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice's offer might have been ""fair"" in a normal scenario, but the inflation dynamic changes everything.  It hurts Alice more than it hurts Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Bob needs to signal he understands the game's dynamic. By making an aggressive offer, he puts the pressure on Alice to accept a less-favorable deal now before inflation devalues the money further.
* **Not Too Greedy:** While aiming high, Bob avoids being insultingly greedy (e.g., 90/10 split). There's a chance Alice acts irrationally or miscalculates the inflation, so leaving her a somewhat tempting offer increases the chance of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of. Let's split it 48/52, or we both risk losing more next round. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Shift:** Alice's offer has significantly improved from her 60/40 split. This indicates she understands the impact of inflation and wants to avoid further losses.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money is losing value rapidly. While Bob might be able to push for a slightly better deal in the next round, the inflation means the potential gain might be outweighed by the loss in overall value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice's offer could get worse in future rounds, especially if she miscalculates or gets desperate. Accepting a decent offer now secures a reasonable gain for Bob."
