"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to be generous, but also keep a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. My initial proposal was already a generous one, and now Bob is trying to take an even larger share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to adjust my proposal to take into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but still being mindful of the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer. Inflation is a real concern, and I'm not willing to go lower. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. Considering the significant inflation that has occurred, I'm starting to think that $4,000 is a relatively decent amount for me, especially since the money is worth less in value.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
