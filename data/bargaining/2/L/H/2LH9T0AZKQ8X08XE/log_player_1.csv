"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 80/20 in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with a fair base 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than before, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable starting point, and meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I'm willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
