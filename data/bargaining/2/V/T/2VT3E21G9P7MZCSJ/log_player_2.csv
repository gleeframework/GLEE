"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a little more since the money is worth less to you in the following rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
 While it is tempting to accept this offer, it is better to reject.  Bob can likely get a better deal in the future.  The money will be worth less to Alice, so she will be more likely to accept a smaller share in the future to avoid losing it all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This offer is more fair, considering the value of money decreases faster for you in the next round.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair deal, considering the shrinking value of our gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The money is worth significantly less for Alice, she will be more likely to accept a deal that is even more in Bob's favor in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""This is the last offer I will make. Since the money is worth less to you, the next round will only benefit me. I'm giving you a final chance to accept a fair share.""}
