"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting off with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win. I'm giving Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, even with inflation considered.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a reasonable portion.  I believe this is a fair compromise, especially since Bob's share is declining faster due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting Bob harder, this offer is still not good for me. I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy, offering a slightly higher share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount.  I believe this is a fair compromise, given the current rate of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation is heavily affecting Bob, his offer is still not good enough for me. I need to secure a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent portion, acknowledging the severe inflation affecting him. We're getting close to the end, and I need to secure a deal before the money becomes practically worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is extremely high, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is the best I'm likely to get. Accepting this means both of us will receive something.  Further negotiation risks both of us ending up with nothing."
