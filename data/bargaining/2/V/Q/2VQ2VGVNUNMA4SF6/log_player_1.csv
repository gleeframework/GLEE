"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm taking a smaller cut than you offered in the last round, since the money is losing value with each round. We can get this done and stop losing money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
