Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse with each round due to inflation, accepting $4,300 is still a significant loss compared to what I could potentially gain.  Alice knows the pressure is on me, but I need to hold out for a better offer. There's still a chance she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the final rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5350, ""alice_gain"": 4650, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on. This is my final offer.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  While $4,400 is a significant reduction from my initial target, rejecting this offer carries a huge risk. Inflation is eating into my potential gains, and Alice knows I'm running out of time. If I reject this and don't secure a better deal in the next few rounds, I risk ending up with nothing. It's a tough choice, but accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, even with the inflation losses."
