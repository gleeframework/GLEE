"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I want a bigger slice for myself to make up for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
