"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, so we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering a slightly skewed split, with me getting $45 and Bob getting $55."
