"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite lopsided, Alice. Let's be fair - how about a 65/35 split? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
