It's painful, but at this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The value of my potential winnings is decreasing significantly with each round due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems determined to get the larger share and is likely to continue offering me slightly worse deals as time runs out. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, I risk getting a slightly worse deal later, or even worse, walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next five rounds. 

While accepting this offer means I'm getting a smaller share, it's better to secure a reasonable sum now than to risk ending up with nothing."
