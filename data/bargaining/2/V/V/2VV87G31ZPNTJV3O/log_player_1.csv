"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than risking further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I need to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 20% gain when the money is worth less. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further depreciation of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, but still trying to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'll give you a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

I'm starting to feel the pinch, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slightly better deal than the previous one, I'm still not getting a good enough share considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the further depreciation of the money due to inflation.

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Meet me at 60/40 and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really stretching it, Alice! I'll give you a better split, but don't expect any more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

I'm getting desperate, but I still want to try to get a better deal. However, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer and risk losing even more value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point. I'm not thrilled about it, but I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation."
