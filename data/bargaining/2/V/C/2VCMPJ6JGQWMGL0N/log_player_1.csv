"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm still giving him a decent chunk of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! Let's try to find a more balanced solution. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to reject my initial offer.

For Round 2, I'll consider Bob's counteroffer. While it's a significant amount for me to gain, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer of my own.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob, but I think I can do better than 15% of the remaining amount. Let's try again!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","For Round 3, I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 180000,
  ""bob_gain"": 820000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share of the remaining amount.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in just yet, Alice. I want a bigger share of the remaining amount. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! My gain is worth significantly less now.

For Round 4, I'll consider Bob's new offer. While it's a bit more generous than his previous offer, I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

For Round 5, I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 220000,
  ""bob_gain"": 780000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share of the remaining amount, and we can wrap up the game.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
