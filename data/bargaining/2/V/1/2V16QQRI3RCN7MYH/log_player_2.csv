Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd prefer more, I'm wary of the decreasing value of the money.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
