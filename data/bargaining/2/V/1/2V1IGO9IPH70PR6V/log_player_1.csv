"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but it's a generous offer to Bob, considering he'll be getting a significant amount of money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable one. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.
