"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than even split. How about I get a slight edge? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm willing to give Bob a 60/40 split, especially since I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting him. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm not going all the way to 60%. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much."
