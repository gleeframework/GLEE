"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer. I'd rather not settle for a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With my share still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. However, I'm not sure if I should push for more, considering Bob's gain is already quite low. I'll think about it... 

After some consideration, I'll accept Bob's offer.
