I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering an 80/20 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I need to ensure I get a significant share to account for the inflation."

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and is offering me a ridiculously small share. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

# Bob gain: 980000

Bob's offer is even worse than before. While the inflation is significant, I will not accept such a meager share.  I will continue to fight for a fairer distribution."

# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is insulting.  It's clear he's trying to exploit the inflation and take advantage of the situation.  I won't accept this and will continue to negotiate for a fairer split."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
