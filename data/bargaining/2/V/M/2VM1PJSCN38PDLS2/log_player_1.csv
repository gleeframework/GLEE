"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly. I propose 55/45 in my favor, considering I'm taking the risk of potential inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
