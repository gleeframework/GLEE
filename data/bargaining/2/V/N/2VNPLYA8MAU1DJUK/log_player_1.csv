# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With each round, the money is worth less, so it's better to get a larger share now rather than waiting for a potentially better offer later. However, Bob's offer is quite generous, and I'm not sure if I should risk waiting for a better deal.
