"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to keep 70% of the original $100, which is $70, and Bob will get $30. The message is a friendly invitation for Bob to negotiate if he wants a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a fair starting point. Your turn to adjust! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. My gain of $50 is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation, which is $40. I'm hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob $45, which is worth 45% of the original $100, and keeping $55, which is worth 55% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think 60/40 is a fair compromise. You can try to negotiate further if you want. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain even further. I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. My gain of $40 is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, which is $40. I'm willing to take it, as it's better than the $35 I would get if I wait for the next round.
