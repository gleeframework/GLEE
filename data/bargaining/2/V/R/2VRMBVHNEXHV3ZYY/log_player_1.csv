"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh? I'll consider his offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this.

I'll accept his offer for now. I'll take the $40 and hope to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
