"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, let's move on 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't like Bob's offer. I'm not willing to accept a 80-20 split, where Bob gets most of the money. I think I deserve a better share, especially since my money is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's time to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get equal shares of the money. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a little, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and this 85-15 split is still very unfair. I'm not willing to accept such a small share of the money. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, let's find a middle ground""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, where I give Bob a slightly larger share of the money. I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to a 50-50 split, but still gives Bob a bit more than my previous offer."
