Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. Let's split the money evenly and avoid losing more of it to inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now at a 50/50 split.  While I could try to push for more, the decreasing value for Bob makes it increasingly unlikely he'll accept a deal favoring me. Accepting now guarantees I get a reasonable share before inflation further erodes his potential gains and pushes him towards a less favorable (for me) compromise."
