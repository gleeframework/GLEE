"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant advantage for me but still allows for some room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  Considering the inflation, my gain is 20% lower than in the previous round, and it is likely to decrease further with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $6000, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we go through more rounds."
