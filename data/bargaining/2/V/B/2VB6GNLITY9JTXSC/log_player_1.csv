Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation disparity, but let's find a more balanced split. This offer considers both our interests. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out, and the money is losing value for both of us. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but this is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.  We both lose with continued inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. Here's why: 

* **Inflation:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both of us.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly better outcome for me in a future round, but the gains are shrinking rapidly due to inflation.  
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting and continuing carries the risk of getting a worse offer later or even timing out and getting nothing. 
 
A 50/50 split isn't my ideal outcome, but given the circumstances and the rapidly decreasing value of the money, it's the most pragmatic choice."
