"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. Accept now and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is worth 5% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to $57. And Bob's gain of $70 is worth 10% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is equivalent to $36.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'm better off accepting this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
