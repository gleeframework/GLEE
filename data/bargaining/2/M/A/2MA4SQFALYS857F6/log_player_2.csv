"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With the inflation, the money will be worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hitting us both, so it seems like the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I think I can still negotiate for a better deal. The money is worth less for both of us, but significantly less for Alice. I'll wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your end, I'm willing to take a bit more. How about 60 for me and 40 for you? It's still a relatively fair split considering the current value of the money for both of us.""}"
