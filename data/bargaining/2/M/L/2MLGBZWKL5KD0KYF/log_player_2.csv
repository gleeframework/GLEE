{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor? This way I get slightly more, but you still get a significant chunk considering the inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each round. A 50/50 split seems fair to me. We can both agree and get something rather than risking getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
