"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself.  While I'd like more, I want to incentivize Bob to accept in the first round to avoid inflation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation has already made my share worth less, and I'm not sure if Bob will get any less greedy in future rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something."
