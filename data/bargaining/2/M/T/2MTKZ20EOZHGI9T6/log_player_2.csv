"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should try to be a little more equitable. This offer is better for me than the last round, but still gives you a significant amount.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The value of the money decreases each round. While Alice's offer wasn't terrible, it heavily favored her. It's important to try and secure a better deal quickly.
* **Fairness:**  While a 50/50 split might seem ideal, Alice has a lower inflation rate. A slightly higher share for Bob compensates for this difference in value depreciation.
* **Strategic Bargaining:** Starting with a slightly ambitious offer gives room for negotiation. Alice may counter with something more appealing to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, the offer is still not advantageous for me considering the inflation rate.  Each round significantly eats into my potential gains. I need to push for a better deal while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and the fact that the money is losing value for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** This is a crucial round.  The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and another rejection could lead to an even worse outcome in the next round. 
* **Firmness:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and unlikely to budge further.
* **Slight Concession:** I've come down slightly from my previous offer to show a willingness to compromise, but it's still a better deal for me than Alice's previous offer considering the inflation difference. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing my potential gain and the risk of further devaluation."
