"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money into $600000 for me and $400000 for you. This way, we can both benefit from the initial amount while accounting for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for less than half the money right away.  There are still many rounds to go, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split.  Let's both get closer to half, knowing the money will be worth less in future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose an equal division of $500000 each. This ensures fairness and maximizes our gains given the constraints of the game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair and ensures we both get a substantial amount, especially considering the decreasing value of the money.  It's a good way to avoid risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
