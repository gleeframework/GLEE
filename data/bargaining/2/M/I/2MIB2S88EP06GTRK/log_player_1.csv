"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can take the rest 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still get $6,000 in value, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, so he's effectively getting $6,400 in value.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, he's effectively getting $2,112 in value, which is a lot less than his previous offer.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
