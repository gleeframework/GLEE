This is frustrating, but I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting 40 dollars that are worth even less due to inflation is a bad deal. Let's see if Alice gets desperate."

# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is incredibly frustrating, but I still hold a sliver of hope. Accepting 35 dollars that are worth almost half their value due to inflation feels like a huge loss.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, but there's a chance she'll panic in the last rounds."

Round 10

# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my earlier offers. Now it's getting really cheap for me 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a brutal outcome, but I have no choice. Accepting 30 dollars, even with the heavy inflation, is better than getting nothing at all in the next round. Alice played this game ruthlessly, and I underestimated her willingness to push this to the very end."
