"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but let's keep it reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, he's now offering me $4800 (80% of the original $6000) and keeping $1440 (20% of the original $6000). I'll accept this offer.
