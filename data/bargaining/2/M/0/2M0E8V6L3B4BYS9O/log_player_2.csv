"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I think this is a fair split to get the game going. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation, I think this is a more suitable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing faster for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I'll accept this offer. The decreasing value of the money is a significant concern for me, and I don't think I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation, and I'd rather take the 4200 now than risk getting less in the next round."
