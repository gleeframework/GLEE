"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money, and we're both losing out with each round. My last offer was already generous, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll take $5,500 and you take $4,500. It's a fair deal that avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
