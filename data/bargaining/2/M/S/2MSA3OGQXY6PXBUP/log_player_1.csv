"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my first offer. I'm going for a large share, but I'm also leaving some for Bob.  I want to see if he'll accept this early offer, or if he'll try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I'm not ready to give up that much yet.  I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still trying to hold onto a larger share, but I'm reducing my offer a bit to be more reasonable. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really hitting hard now.  I need to accept this offer, even though it's not ideal.  I can't afford to keep rejecting and risk getting nothing."
