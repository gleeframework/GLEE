I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as I get the majority of the money and Bob still gets something.  I'm hoping he accepts it in the first round to avoid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is already hitting my potential earnings. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option to ensure I get at least half of the money, even with the devaluation."
