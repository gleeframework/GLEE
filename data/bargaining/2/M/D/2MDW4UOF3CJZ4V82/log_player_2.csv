Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure if Alice is being fair. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 this time, with me getting the larger share. This way, we can avoid losing money due to the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle to minimize inflation loss! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and getting less in the next round."
