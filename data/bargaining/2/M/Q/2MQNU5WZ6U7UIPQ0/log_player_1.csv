"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that the money will depreciate faster for me. Let's work together to make sure we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
