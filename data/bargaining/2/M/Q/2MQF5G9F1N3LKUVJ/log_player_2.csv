"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $40, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Remember, the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round, so she may be more willing to compromise later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation that will hit us in the next rounds.  Let's get this settled.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is running out and this offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I'm still going to reject. Alice is trying to exploit the inflation, but the money is worth less to her than it is to me. I'm hoping that in the next round, I can make a counter-proposal and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's split the difference and go with 55/45.  It's a fair compromise given the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit here too, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's message makes it clear this is her final offer. While I'm not thrilled with the 48/52 split, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, I'm going to accept.  Time is running out, and I don't want to gamble on getting a better deal in the next round."
