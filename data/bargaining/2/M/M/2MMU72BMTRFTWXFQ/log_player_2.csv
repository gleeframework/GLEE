"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems reasonable at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Bob's money is worth less each round, so it's in his best interest to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's fair considering our different inflation rates. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your split was too harsh considering the inflation is hitting me harder.  This offer is fair and gets us both a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is more appealing this round. While I'd still prefer a higher share, the inflation is significantly impacting Alice, and a 450,000 gain is still substantial for me.  It's best to accept and avoid further losses due to inflation."
