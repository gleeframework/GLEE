"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

This way, I'll get 32% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 68%."
