"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999,999 and let you have 1 dollar.  It's a fair start, right? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not going to let Alice get away with that! I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair. Let's start with this, and see if we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. I think that's the fairest solution, and it avoids further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and it avoids the risk of losing more money to inflation.  I'll take it."
