"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this offer before the money's value drops further. It's a fair split considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it seems like a ""fair"" split in the first round, considering the inflation rates, I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal for myself.  The money will be worth less to Alice in the next round, so she might be more willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering you a slightly better deal than you gave me.  Let's both make a little more before the money loses value."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: As the money's value continues to drop, let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a lower amount than what I proposed. While the money is losing value, I'm not desperate yet. I'm going to reject again and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. With the inflation rate, we both need to compromise. This offer is fair, considering our losses.""
