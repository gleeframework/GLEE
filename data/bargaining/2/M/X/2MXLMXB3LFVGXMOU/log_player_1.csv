"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the potential of losing more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting less than my initial offer, it's still a significant amount of money, and it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting even less in the next round."
