"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000
* Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000

I'm not thrilled with the terms, but I'll play it safe. I'll accept this offer.
