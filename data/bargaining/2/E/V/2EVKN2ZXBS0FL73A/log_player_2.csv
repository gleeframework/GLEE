Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I need to hold firm for a better offer.  Alice is clearly using time pressure and the inflation factor to her advantage. Accepting now would be significantly worse than a 50/50 split. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not equal value anymore, adapt! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous, but I can't accept an offer this low. Even with the inflation working against me, holding out for a better deal is the best course of action. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, but I'm hoping she'll realize that a poor deal for me is ultimately a loss for both of us as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 8

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is incredibly frustrating. While I'm getting desperate, accepting this offer would be a significant loss. I'm holding out hope that Alice will understand the severity of the situation and make a more reasonable offer in the remaining rounds."
