"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more, let's see if you accept! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather take a smaller share now and avoid further erosion of my potential gain.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
