"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight lead, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a more even split than my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this one."
