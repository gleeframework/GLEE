**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm not budging easily.  With each round, the value diminishes significantly for me, while it remains constant for her. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she gets more desperate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a simple even split to end this. Don't be greedy, we both lose if this goes on.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and Alice is clearly willing to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split is now the most logical choice:

* **Simplicity:** It's clear, easy to understand, and leaves no room for misinterpretation. 
* **Fairness:**  It avoids the back-and-forth haggling and presents a solution where we both benefit equally.
* **Urgency:**  With the increasing inflation, every round makes the potential gains less appealing. A clean split now guarantees a decent sum for both of us."
