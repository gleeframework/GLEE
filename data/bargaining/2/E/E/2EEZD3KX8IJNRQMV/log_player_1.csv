"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, 60-40 my way this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, so I'll consider the proposal in terms of the new values.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share when I could potentially negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the inflation, and I'm aiming for a more balanced split."
