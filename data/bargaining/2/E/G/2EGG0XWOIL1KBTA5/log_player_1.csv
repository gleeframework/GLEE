"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $8,000 to me.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. It's a 50-50 split, and I'm willing to take it since it's a fair offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
