I'm going to offer Bob $45 and keep $55 for myself. This is a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still leaving me with the majority.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the offer now.  Since inflation is hitting us harder than Bob, my share is worth less each round. Accepting now secures a decent amount, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
