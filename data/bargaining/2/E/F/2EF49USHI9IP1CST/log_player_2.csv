Let's see what Alice offers next.  I'm going to try to get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a split that favors me more.  Alice's offer was too generous.  I think she'll accept this, but if not, we'll keep going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take the 500,000 now, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing.  Alice seems to be getting more reasonable, so maybe we can reach a deal."
