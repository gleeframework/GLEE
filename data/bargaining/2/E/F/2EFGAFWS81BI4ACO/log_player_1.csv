"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% now, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'll calculate the actual values of the offer:
Alice gain: 6000 * 0.95 (95% of the original value) = 5700
Bob gain: 4000 * 0.9 (90% of the original value) = 3600

Considering the reduced values, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.
