"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into $6,000 for me and $4,000 for you. This way, we can both benefit from the initial amount before considering the potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation. It allows for both of us to get a good share of the money, and provides some buffer for potential losses in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
