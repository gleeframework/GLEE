"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about the offer.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 70 is a good enough share for me, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 80 is a fairer split given the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money, I need to think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if 75 is a good enough share for me.

After some thought, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for 75, especially since the money is worth even less now. I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think 85 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. You're not getting a great deal, but it's better than nothing.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
