"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the cash quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we can quickly divide the money and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable approach, as it's a fair split. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
