"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with inflation in mind.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in round 4, considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial value of my gain in round 1: $6000
Inflation rate: 10% per round
After round 1: $6000 / 1.1 = $5454.55 (approximately)
After round 2: $5454.55 / 1.1 = $4945.50 (approximately)
After round 3: $4945.50 / 1.1 = $4495.00 (approximately)
After round 4: $4495.00 / 1.1 = $4082.73 (approximately)

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually quite generous.
