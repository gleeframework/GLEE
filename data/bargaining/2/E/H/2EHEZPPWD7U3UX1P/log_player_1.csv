This is a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my potential gain. However, it's important to consider that Bob will be losing 5% of the value of his share with each passing round, so he might be willing to accept a somewhat lower amount.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
