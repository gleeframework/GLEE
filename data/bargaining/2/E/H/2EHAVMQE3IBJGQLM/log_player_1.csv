"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure if a 40:60 split is the best I can do, considering the potential for further inflation. I'd like to think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the previous round. I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Inflation is a factor, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my gain by 27.1% compared to the first round, I need to think carefully about this offer.

A 50:50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the uncertainty of inflation. It's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain is now significantly reduced. I'll need to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and propose a slightly skewed split. I think I deserve a bit more, given the uncertainty of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
