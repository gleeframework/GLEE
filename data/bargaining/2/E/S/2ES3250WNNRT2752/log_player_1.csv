# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting closer to the deadline. I'm willing to accept an offer that gives me 65% of the initial amount, which is $6,500, and Bob gets 35%, which is $3,500. Let's finalize the deal!"
