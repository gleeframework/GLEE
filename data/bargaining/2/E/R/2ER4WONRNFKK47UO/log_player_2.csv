"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share but you'll get a decent start. Accept and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. Alice is starting with a very imbalanced offer, but the inflation will work in my favor as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing with every passing round. Take the deal while it's still worthwhile.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing for both of us, so let's find a compromise. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is still better than the 30/70 you offered.  Think about it - if we keep rejecting each other, we'll end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is right about the decreasing value, but she's still trying to take a large chunk. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a bad deal. Let's see what she offers in the next round after this rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to move a bit.  I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and the decreasing value.  Let's settle this now and avoid losing even more.""}"
