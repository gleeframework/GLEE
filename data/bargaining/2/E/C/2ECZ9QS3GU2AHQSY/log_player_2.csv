Let's see what Alice will propose next.  I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal right off the bat!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a split of 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Alice. This is a fairer starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Alice wants to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer. Even with the inflation on Alice's side,  I'm happy to take a 50/50 split."
