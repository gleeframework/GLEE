"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. My message to Bob is to start the game with a fair split, and see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so the offer from Bob is equivalent to a 36-64 split in terms of purchasing power for me.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 36-64 split, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and considering the 20% reduction in Bob's gain from the first round, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time, a 50-50 split is fair.""
}
```"
