"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable proposal and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I'm thinking I deserve a bit more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll! With the 20% decrease, my gain is now worth less than I initially thought.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{

}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, Bob. Don't make me regret it!""

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the 48.8% decrease, my gain is worth a fraction of what it was initially.
