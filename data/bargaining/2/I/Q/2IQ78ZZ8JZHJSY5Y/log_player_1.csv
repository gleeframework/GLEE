"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm essentially getting 90% of the original $500,000, which is $450,000. Meanwhile, Bob is getting 95% of the original $500,000, which is $475,000.

Considering this, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split, giving Bob a bit more, but still trying to get a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm essentially getting 72.9% of the original $500,000, which is $363,000. Meanwhile, Bob is getting 85.74% of the original $500,000, which is $427,500.

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think this offer is relatively fair. I'll accept Bob's offer.
