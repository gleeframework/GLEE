"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

My gain: 5000
Bob's gain: 5700 (6000 * 0.95)

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the money is still worth 0% less for me but 10% less for Bob (5% less from Round 1 and 5% less from Round 2).

My proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly higher share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain: 5000 (no change)
Bob's gain: 5200 * 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = 4475.28

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 5, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer, considering the money is still worth 0% less for me but 19.26% less for Bob (5% less from Round 1, 5% less from Round 2, and 9.26% less from Round 4).

My proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get an even higher share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain: 5000 (no change)
Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.7778 (1 - 0.2222) = 3889

It looks like Bob is trying to go back to the original 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, he's actually offering me a slightly higher amount. I'll accept this offer.
