# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still being greedy. While I'm losing some value due to inflation, I'm not going to accept a deal where she gets 90% of the money. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round."

Alice is still being unreasonable.  Even though I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, I won't accept a deal where she gets 80% of the money.  I'll make a final counter-offer in the next round."
