I'm going to start with a generous offer, giving Bob a small portion. Hopefully, he'll accept and we can avoid the inflation risk!"

Bob is getting greedier with each round. I'm still not willing to accept such a low share, especially with the inflation hitting him less hard. I believe I can still get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, even with the inflation affecting him. I will continue to hold out for a better deal. The risk of getting nothing is becoming more significant, but I still believe I can secure a reasonable share."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This round, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Inflation is hitting both of us now, and I believe this is the fairest outcome.  We both risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
