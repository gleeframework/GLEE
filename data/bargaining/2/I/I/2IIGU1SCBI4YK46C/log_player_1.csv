"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it seems like the most straightforward and fair way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's 60 dollars is actually worth 48 dollars in real value, while my 40 dollars is still worth 40 dollars. This means I'm actually getting the better deal in this proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
