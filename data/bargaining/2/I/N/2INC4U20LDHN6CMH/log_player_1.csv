"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, but with a slightly more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to manipulate me with this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not convinced that this is a fair deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm trying to take a slightly more aggressive approach and offer Bob a bit less than he initially offered me, while still being somewhat generous. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share too 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good one, especially considering the inflation rate. I'm losing more value with each passing round, and I don't think I should accept an offer that gives me 8% less than my initial proposal.

I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer Bob a bit more than he initially offered me, while still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a good deal here 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting desperate, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 2% larger share than my initial proposal. The inflation rate is really affecting the value of the money, and I think I deserve a better deal.

I'll make one more attempt to negotiate and try to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I'm making a final offer, take it or leave it""}

I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, trying to get a better deal for myself. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation rate. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
