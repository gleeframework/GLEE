Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's tempting to take 10% now, the inflation will hurt Bob much more than it will hurt me in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by proposing in the next round."
