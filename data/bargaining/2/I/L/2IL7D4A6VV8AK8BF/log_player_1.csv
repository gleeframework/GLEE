Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair! Given the 10% decrease in value for me each round, this offer is more than reasonable. We both get a significant share, and it's better for both of us to agree now rather than lose more value.

# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000
