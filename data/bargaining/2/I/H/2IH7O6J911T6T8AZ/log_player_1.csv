# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable proposal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the money is worth less now."
