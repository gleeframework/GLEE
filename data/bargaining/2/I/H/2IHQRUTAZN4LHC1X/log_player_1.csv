"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer. This gives me a good starting point, and Bob may accept as it's still a decent amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is hurting my potential gains, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome for me.  It's unlikely I can get a better deal later on, especially considering Bob is now making the offer."
