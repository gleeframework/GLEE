"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I propose I take $60 and you take $40. It's important to settle this early on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try and get a better deal. It's early in the game and the money is still worth a lot. Let's see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, as we both get a larger portion of the money. Let's get this settled so we don't lose too much to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. My initial offer is still on the table. Consider how much we both lose with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer ensures we both get something, and the longer we wait, the less valuable it becomes."
