"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, which is a 9:1 ratio. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a better deal from here! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth only $400,000. I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, as it seems like I'm giving up some of my potential gain. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain of $500,000 is now worth only $400,000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a better balance!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself, which is a 7:3 ratio."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a better deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! My gain of $580,000 is now worth only $293,600. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like I'm giving up a significant amount of value.

However, I don't want to risk waiting too long and having the money become even less valuable. I'll accept the offer, hoping that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
