Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this. It's the most logical solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** At this stage, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of Bob's potential gains. Accepting $5,000 now is better than risking further losses in subsequent rounds. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered slightly better deals for herself, and now she's agreeing to a 50/50 split.  This indicates she is unlikely to concede more.
* **Time Pressure:**  Each round increases the negative impact of inflation on Bob. Prolonging the negotiation only weakens his position.

While Bob might ideally want more, accepting the 50/50 split in Round 5 is the most pragmatic choice given the circumstances and the diminishing returns.
