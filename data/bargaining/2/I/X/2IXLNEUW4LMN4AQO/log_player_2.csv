"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  This seems fair to me, and it's best to avoid the money losing value through inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's always best to try and get a bit more, especially when inflation is a factor.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I think 65/35 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done before the money loses too much value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer isn't considering the inflation we face. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but it needs to be realistic. How about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, I still believe a 60/40 split is more fair, especially considering the inflation affecting Alice. Let's see if we can reach a more agreeable solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with 60/40.  It's a fair split considering the inflation, and we need to move forward before we lose too much money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value is going down with every round.  Let's just split it evenly at 50/50 and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right, we're losing too much value with each round.  50/50 is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's just split it and move on."
