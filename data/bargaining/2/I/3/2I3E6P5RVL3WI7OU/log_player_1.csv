"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% of the money this time. It's a fair split considering inflation will impact Alice's share more in the next round.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
