"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While seemingly close to fair, I lose money to inflation by waiting. I need to aim for a larger share to make up for this disadvantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but time is working against me. This offer accounts for inflation's impact.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is slightly better than her initial offer, but still not advantageous to me. Inflation is eating into my potential gains, and waiting any longer will make it even harder to come out ahead. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging both your desire for a larger share and the time pressure from inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but I still think my share should be higher. Inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting worse! Alice is using my disadvantage against me. While time pressure is mounting, accepting this would be a significant loss compared to even her initial offer. I need to hold firm and hope she sees the cliff approaching for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your greed.  I'm offering a slight edge to you, but this is the best you're going to get.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't blame me for inflation, Bob. You're the one who's losing value each round. I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the larger share 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is painful, but I have to accept. Alice is clearly content to run the clock down, and this offer is barely above her previous one.  If I reject it, the inflation will eat up any potential gains from a better offer in the later rounds."
