Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 20% loss in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I feel I'm getting a relatively small share of the pie, and I'm still losing value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I feel I'm getting a very small share, and the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, hoping to get a larger share before the money becomes even less valuable."
