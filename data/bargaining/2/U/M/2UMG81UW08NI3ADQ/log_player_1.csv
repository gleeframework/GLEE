"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 10% less, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer.

Since my gain of $800,000 in the first round is still worth the same, but Bob's gain of $750,000 is worth 10% less than his initial $750,000, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept this offer.
