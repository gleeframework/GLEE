"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your proposal, let's aim for an even split considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 from the previous round is now worth $6,400 in real value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $6,000 and Bob will have $4,000.

I'll accept this offer.
