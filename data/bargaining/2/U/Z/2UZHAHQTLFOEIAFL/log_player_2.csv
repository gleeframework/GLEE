"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor to start. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts you more than me, so accepting a slightly smaller share now is in your best interest.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer doesn't reflect the speed at which my funds are devaluing. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. It's a compromise, and time is of the essence. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000
