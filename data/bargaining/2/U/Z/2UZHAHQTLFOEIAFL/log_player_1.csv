Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts you more than me, so accepting a slightly smaller share now is in your best interest.

# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
