650000.0,350000.0,Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor to start.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, your starting offer was a bit too greedy for my liking. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that inflation hurts you more than me, so accepting a slightly smaller share now is in your best interest.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer doesn't reflect the speed at which my funds are devaluing. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. It's a compromise, and time is of the essence.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's stop wasting time and both losing money. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with a reasonable amount.",Bob,4,
