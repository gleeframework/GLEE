"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making it harder for me to get a good deal!

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
