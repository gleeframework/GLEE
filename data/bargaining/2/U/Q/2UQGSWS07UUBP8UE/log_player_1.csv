"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more optimistic view this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40-60 split, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's try again""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and we can reach a agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to be more generous this time, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my money! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer of 45-55 is still not ideal, but I think I'll have to accept it since it's the best I can get at this point.
