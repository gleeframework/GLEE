"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, giving me 75% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 25%. I'm leaving the message ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!"" to see if Bob is interested in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a more balanced split, and it gives us both a chance to win more. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth $360,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth $522,500.

I'll consider Bob's offer. While it's a more balanced split, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, giving me 60% of the current value of the money ($600,000) and Bob 40% ($400,000). I'm leaving the message ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you can do better."" to see if Bob is willing to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair and equal split. Let's avoid further inflation and agree to this. We both have a lot to lose if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $262,500, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is now worth $427,500.

I'm not thrilled about the equal split, but I don't want to risk losing more value due to further inflation. I'll accept this offer to get a guaranteed $262,500.
