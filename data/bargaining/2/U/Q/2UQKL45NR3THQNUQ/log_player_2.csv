I want to see if I can get a better deal.  While a 250,000$ gain is tempting, I'm not sure Alice is going to be willing to share more equally in the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While this offer is tempting, I think I can still get a better deal.  I need to find a balance between getting as much money as possible now and ensuring we reach a deal before the money is worth nothing."
