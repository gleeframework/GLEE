"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 60/40 this time, I think it's fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's revised offer, considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this time. Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's try 52/48.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $5,200 and Bob receives $4,800. I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob."
