"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 7000 for me and 3000 for you. Consider it or let's see what the next round brings. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's go with 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This way we both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rejection, I adjust our proposal. I suggest dividing the money into 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This maintains a reasonable difference while still being fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation is starting to hit, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
