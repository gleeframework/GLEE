"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and then we can reassess and adjust as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that I should accept an offer that gives me 40% of the total amount. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the risk of future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation risk.""}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to protect my own interests in case the inflation continues to rise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more risk and offer you a slightly smaller share, but I think 65/35 is a fair split considering the inflation risk and my increased risk-taking 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with a 65/35 split, especially since the money I gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the current inflation rate and my reduced purchasing power.

I'll think carefully about my next move, considering the decreasing value of my potential gains and the increasing risk of future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk and offer you a slightly larger share, but I think 60/40 is a fair split considering the current inflation rate and my reduced purchasing power.""}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to protect my own interests in the face of increasing inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept the offer."
