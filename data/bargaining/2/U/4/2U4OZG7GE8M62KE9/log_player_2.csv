"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this offer and we can both leave with some money. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation rate means that even a small delay in accepting could result in a much better deal for him later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than it's hitting me, Bob. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer.  While the inflation has eroded his potential gains, taking 3500 is still better than risking further losses and getting nothing in a later round."
