Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Bob) with each round. Accepting Alice's offer of $43 is better than risking getting an even lower amount in subsequent rounds, or even nothing if I reach the final round and have to accept whatever she offers."
