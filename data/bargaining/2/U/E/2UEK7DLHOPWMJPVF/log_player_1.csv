"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share but leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000.  Since Bob rejected my initial offer and then offered a 40/60 split, I'm offering a counter-proposal that's more in line with my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still significantly worse than the 90/10 split I offered in the first round.  Considering the significant inflation, I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 70/30 split, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000. With the significant inflation, I'm offering a slightly higher share than my previous offer, while still leaving Bob with a respectable amount.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the current economic landscape."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, Bob's offer is the closest to a 50/50 split, which would be considered fair. It's better to accept this offer than risk further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal in the next round."
