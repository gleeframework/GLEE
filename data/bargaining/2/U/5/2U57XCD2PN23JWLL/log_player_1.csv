"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the first to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm the one making the offer now. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor. My proposal from the first round was already generous, and I'm not inclined to give him an even larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer from the second round was a 60-40 split in his favor. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split""
