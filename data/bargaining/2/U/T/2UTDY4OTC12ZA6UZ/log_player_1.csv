"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a significant amount, but still getting a bit more for myself, considering I'm making the first offer. The message is meant to be persuasive, encouraging Bob to accept and end the game early, before inflation takes its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, before it's too late""
}


I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground with Bob, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. The message is meant to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer before the value of the money drops further."
