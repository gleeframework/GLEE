Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount.  Accept now and we both get something.  
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000
