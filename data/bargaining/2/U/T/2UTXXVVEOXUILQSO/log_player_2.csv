"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair (ish) deal. Take 1% now, or risk getting nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's risky to accept such a small amount at the beginning, especially considering the inflation. It's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount.  Accept now and we both get something. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. We're both losing value with each round. This is the most logical way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good deal given the risk of inflation. Accepting this offer means we both get a fair amount of money, and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting."
