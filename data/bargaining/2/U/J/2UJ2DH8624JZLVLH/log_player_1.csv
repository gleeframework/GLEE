"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can always come back to the negotiating table later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, with me getting $520,000 and Bob getting $480,000. My message is a gentle reminder that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
