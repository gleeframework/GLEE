"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This is a fair offer as it ensures I receive the majority, but leaves something for Bob. I'm confident he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I propose that I receive $720,000 and Bob receives $280,000.  Since the money is worth less for me this round, I need to make a more aggressive offer to ensure I get a decent share.  However, I still want to leave a reasonable amount for Bob so he might accept this offer."
