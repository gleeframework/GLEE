Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both losing, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's end this.

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, accepting now is better than risking even more significant losses in future rounds.
