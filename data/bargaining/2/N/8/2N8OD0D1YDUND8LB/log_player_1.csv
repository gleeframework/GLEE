Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid potential inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. With inflation, the value of my potential gains decreases with each round.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option at this point."
