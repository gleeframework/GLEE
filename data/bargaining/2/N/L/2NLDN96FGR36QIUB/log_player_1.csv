Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a bold approach and offering Bob a small share.  I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly, as the inflation will eat away at his potential gains if we go too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much better than my first one, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. The inflation hurts him more than it hurts me, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than his last proposal, hoping that this will incentivize him to accept.  I'm still feeling confident that I can get the majority of the money, but I'm trying to find a balance between being aggressive and ensuring a deal gets made."
