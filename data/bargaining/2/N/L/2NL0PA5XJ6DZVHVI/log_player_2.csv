I'm still not satisfied with this offer. It's better than the last one, but I need to keep fighting for a bigger share.  The inflation is really hurting me, so I need to be careful not to accept a deal that's too unfavorable."

I'm getting frustrated with Alice's stubbornness!  The inflation is really hurting me now, but I won't give in unless she's willing to be more reasonable. I need to keep fighting for a better deal!"

I'm running out of time and the inflation is really biting now.  I can't afford to risk losing everything.  I'll take the 45, it's better than nothing.  Hopefully, Alice realizes we're both losing out by not agreeing."
