"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more reasonable in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but a bit greedy. Let's be realistic. This is a fair split, considering the inflation."" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why this is a good move for Bob:

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice is aware that the money loses value faster for Bob.  Delaying works in her favor.  Bob needs to apply pressure while still appearing reasonable.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By framing his offer as ""realistic"" and ""fair,"" Bob subtly implies that Alice's previous offer was neither. This can nudge Alice towards a quicker agreement.
* **Strategic Concession:** Bob is offering slightly more than half to Alice, which might seem counterintuitive. However, it's crucial to remember the inflation. By conceding a little now, Bob might secure a deal before the value drops significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. The value decreases rapidly. This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but this offer is barely better than her last. It's clear she's aiming to secure a significant advantage. The inflation hurts, but I'm betting she'll fold before it gets too much worse."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back-and-forth is pointless. Let's end this now with a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Here's why this is a strong play for Bob:

* **Anchoring:** Bob is now firmly establishing the idea of a 50/50 split as the baseline.  Previous rounds have set a precedent where Alice expects more, so this offer may appear more reasonable than it would have initially.
* **Ultimatum:**  The ""take it or leave it"" language adds pressure.  It signals that Bob is losing patience and might start making less generous offers.
* **Inflation Factor:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, remember that the value is decreasing faster for Bob. Getting an even split at this stage is a win considering the time pressure."
