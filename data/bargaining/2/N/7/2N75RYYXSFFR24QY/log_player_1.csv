I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share of the money, but still offers Bob a significant amount. I'm hoping that this will encourage him to accept the deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  Even though I'm losing 10% due to inflation, his offer gives me less than 30% of the total, which is much lower than my initial offer. I will reject and propose again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm taking a more aggressive approach this time.  Even though I'm facing 20% inflation,  I'm reducing my offer to Bob,  hoping to get closer to my desired outcome.  I'm still offering him a decent amount, though, to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I've lost a lot due to inflation,  Bob's offer is the best I've seen. I've lost close to 30% of my potential gain,  and even though his offer is much lower than my initial goal, it's still a good deal.  Accepting this offer is better than risking even further inflation."
