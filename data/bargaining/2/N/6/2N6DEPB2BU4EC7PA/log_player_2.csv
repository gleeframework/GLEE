Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get the lion's share, but I'm willing to split it with you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal gives Alice too large of a share, and I believe we can find a more equitable division.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
