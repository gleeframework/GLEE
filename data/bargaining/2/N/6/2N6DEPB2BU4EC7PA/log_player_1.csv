Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. This split is more reasonable, considering we both want a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
