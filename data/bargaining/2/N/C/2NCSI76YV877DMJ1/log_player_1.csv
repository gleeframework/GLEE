"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 80-20""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, where I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get ripped off! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a slightly better deal than before, but I'm still getting a smaller share. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75-25 split, where I get $75 and Bob gets $25. This is a slightly better deal for me, but I'm still leaving some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a slightly better deal than before, but I'm still not getting the best possible outcome. However, I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round, so I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
