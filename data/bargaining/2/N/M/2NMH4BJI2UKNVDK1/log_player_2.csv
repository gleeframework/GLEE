"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'm sure we can find a better solution in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's not a fair split, and the next round will be even more advantageous for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think a 90/10 split is a more fair starting point, considering the inflation effect will work in my favor in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to account for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. It's a significant improvement from the first round, and the potential for a better deal in future rounds is not worth the risk of getting nothing."
