"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable and fair offer, considering that the money will be worth less for me in future rounds due to inflation. I'm also trying to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit with my message ""Let's be fair"".\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he rejects, he'll make a counteroffer in the next round, and I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. The game will continue until one of us accepts the other's offer. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of an even split is actually not as fair as it seems. Considering the inflation, I would be getting less value out of my share than Bob would. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round! I'll try to come up with a more favorable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll try to adjust the amounts to make it more favorable for me. I'll offer Bob a bit less than before, but still try to make it seem like a reasonable deal.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, this is a good deal for both""}\n\nI'm hoping that Bob will see this as a more acceptable offer, considering that I've taken the inflation into account. I'm also trying to convey a sense of pragmatism and mutual benefit with my message. Let's see what Bob decides!"
