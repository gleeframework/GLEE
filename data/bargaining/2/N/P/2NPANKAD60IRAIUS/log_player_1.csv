"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice
I'll propose a division that benefits me more since the money loses value faster for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering inflation!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but my share is impacted more significantly. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice
Given the impact of inflation on both our shares, I still believe my initial offer was reasonable considering the devaluation rates. Since Bob's offer doesn't account for the disproportionate loss in value for him, I'll reject this offer and propose a new division in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice
Considering the increasing impact of inflation, my next offer will slightly adjust to reflect the decreasing value for both of us, but still leans towards compensating for the higher devaluation on Bob's end.

{""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Considering the rising inflation, let's adjust our shares fairly.""}"
