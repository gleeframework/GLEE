"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid going through the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. No need for further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, considering the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about a 50/50 split. I'd like to see a better offer, considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair deal considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile.  Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now! With the money I gain being worth only 72.9% of its original value, I'm getting desperate to get a better deal. However, Bob's offer of a 60/40 split is a significant improvement from my previous offer, and it's not a bad deal considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and the risk of getting an even worse deal in future rounds. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 60/40 it is. Let's wrap this up.""
}
```"
