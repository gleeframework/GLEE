Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering the potential inflation risk and value loss. Let's reach a compromise and finish this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
