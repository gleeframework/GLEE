"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This is fair considering the potential risk and value loss over subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer seems tempting, it's crucial to consider the inflation. Even if Alice's proposed ratio is fair in this round, the value of the money will decrease significantly in future rounds. It's better to try to negotiate a more favorable split or risk losing more money in the long run."
