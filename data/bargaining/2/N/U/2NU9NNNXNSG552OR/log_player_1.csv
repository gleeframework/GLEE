Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. He's sticking close to his original offer and hoping the pressure of inflation will force me to accept. While the deal is getting worse, I'm confident I can still negotiate a better split.  It's risky, but I need to hold firm for a better outcome."
