Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my share, but I need a larger share than Bob offered. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working heavily in Bob's favor. It's still beneficial for Bob to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm coming down, but the clock is ticking, and the value is dropping fast. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** By emphasizing the decreasing value, Bob puts pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Concession:** Bob shows willingness to negotiate by lowering his initial demand, but still maintains a significant advantage. 
* **Urgency:**  The message aims to instill a sense of urgency in Alice to make a deal before the value diminishes further."
