"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the compromise, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a fairer share. I was willing to start with a 50/50 split, and now he's trying to take a bigger chunk. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a majority share""}

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. I think 55% to 45% is a fair compromise. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my goal, but I still think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the decreasing value of Bob's offer due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I still think I deserve a better share. The 48/52 split is not satisfactory, and I'd like to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's settle for a 52/48 split""}

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. A 52/48 split seems like a fair and reasonable division, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
