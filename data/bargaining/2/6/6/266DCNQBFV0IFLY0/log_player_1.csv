"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, my gain of $70 is worth 10% less than the $80 I would have gotten in Round 1, which is $70.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I could potentially get a better deal in the next round, but I don't know what the inflation rates will be then.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a bigger share.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}
```

I'm offering to take 85% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 15%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

With the new inflation rates, my gain of $75 is worth 27.1% less than the $80 I would have gotten in Round 1, which is approximately $58.28.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm still not getting as much as I wanted, but it's a better deal than the previous offers. I'll think about it...

After considering the options, I'll accept this offer.
