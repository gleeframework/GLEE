"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away the farm.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being stingy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd actually be gaining $7,600. And Bob's offer of $4,000 is worth 90% of its original value, so he'd be gaining $3,600.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to be reasonable, but I'd like to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the'meet in the middle' approach, Bob, but I'd like to get a bit more. Let's see what you can do for me!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my $7,600 from Round 2 is now worth 95% of its value, so I'd actually be gaining $7,212. And the total amount of money left is $10,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. How about we split it a bit more evenly?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, let's meet exactly in the middle this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation effect is really taking a toll on my gains! My $7,212 from Round 3 is now worth 85.74% of its value, so I'd actually be gaining $6,200. And Bob's offer of $5,000 is worth 73% of its original value, so he'd be gaining $3,650.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to be reasonable again. Meeting exactly in the middle sounds like a good compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob! Let's meet in the middle and call it a day!""
}
```"
