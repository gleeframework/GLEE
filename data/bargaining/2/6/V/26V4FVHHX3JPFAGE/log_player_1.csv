"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to try to maximize my gains by offering Bob a very small amount.  Since Bob's money is worth less in each round, he might be more inclined to take something small than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my previous offer, and I'm not confident that I can do better in the future rounds.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and might be more likely to accept a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly better for him, and with each round, his money is worth less. It's risky to keep rejecting, as the potential loss from continued rejection is getting higher.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal considering the circumstances."
