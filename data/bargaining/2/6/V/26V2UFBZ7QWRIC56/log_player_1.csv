"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. The message is a friendly nudge to let Bob know it's his turn to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.9 = $360,000
Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.9 = $540,000

Considering the proposal, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
