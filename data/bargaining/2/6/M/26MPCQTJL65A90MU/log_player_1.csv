I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself a significant portion.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation is a serious concern. It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting even less in the next round."
