"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a terrible deal.  Even though I'm getting something, inflation will eat away at it, and I have a chance to get a better deal later.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. It's a fair split, and we can both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. I'll take 60% this time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is much better than the 10% I would have received in the first round, even with inflation.  It's a fair split and I'm happy to take it."
