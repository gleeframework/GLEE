Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  Waiting any longer drastically reduces the potential gain for both players.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome for Bob, especially considering Alice's hardening stance.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting the offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting it risks walking away with nothing if a favorable agreement can't be reached in the remaining rounds.

While Bob could push for a slightly higher amount in the next round or two, the risk associated with that strategy outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
