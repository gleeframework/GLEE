"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. If I accept, I'll get $70, which is a decent amount, but it's still less than what I initially proposed.

However, considering the inflation, the $70 I'll get in this round is actually equivalent to $56 from the initial $100, which is a bit better than my original offer.

I'll take a chance and accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
