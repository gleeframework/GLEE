"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this seems like a fair split initially, I (Bob) lose value faster than Alice due to the higher inflation rate. It's better to negotiate for a slightly larger share early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for the inflation disparity. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  Bob needs to secure a larger share upfront to compensate for the 10% inflation he faces each round. 
* **Fairness:**  While this offer skews slightly in Bob's favor, it's still a reasonable split that allows Alice to benefit as well.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure and encourages Alice to accept to avoid both parties losing out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer this drags on, the less money there is to be had. The current offer, while not ideal, is better than any potential gains from further negotiation considering the inflation rates.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer significantly more than this, especially as she also loses value over time (albeit at a slower rate).
* **Risk Mitigation:** Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing if a deal can't be reached in 12 rounds."
