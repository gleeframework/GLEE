"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for us to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more equitable, considering the inflation affects your share more heavily. Let's start with that.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45 in my favor this time? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, considering the inflation and the fact that we're already on round 3, it seems like accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money."
