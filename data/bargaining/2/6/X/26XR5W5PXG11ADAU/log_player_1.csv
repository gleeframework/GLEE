Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. This leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds while still securing a large portion of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Bob's last offer was very unfair, and I think this is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiations."
