Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not how this works. Let's be reasonable. I take 65%, you take 35%.  We lose money if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
