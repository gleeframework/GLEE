"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer from Bob, but it seems he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much either 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more advantage from the inflation. However, I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the previous round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for another offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit more flexible, but I'm not giving up too much ground""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 52-48 split, trying to find a balance that's more favorable to me. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more fighting 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be more conciliatory now. A 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think we've reached a fair agreement, and I'm happy to split the $1,000,000 equally with Bob."
