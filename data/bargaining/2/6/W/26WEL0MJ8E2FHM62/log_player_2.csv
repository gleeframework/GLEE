"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal. I get most of the money, but you get something. Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided deal. Even with the inflation, there's a chance I can get a better offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering you a good share, but I need a significant portion to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's make a deal and move on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. I'm hoping for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a larger share than your last offer to make it worthwhile. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest solution, and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer than this. It's time to settle for a fair split."
