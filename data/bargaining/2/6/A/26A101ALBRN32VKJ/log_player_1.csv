"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider the value of the money more carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was biased towards his gain. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider the value of the money even more carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
