Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that! Let's split the money more evenly.  I'll take 55% and you get 45%.  It's a win-win, as we'll both get more than we did in the last round.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
