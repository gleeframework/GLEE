"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amount he's gaining in terms of purchasing power. Let's assume the inflation rate is 5% per round, so the money Bob gains in Round 2 is worth 95% of the original amount.

Bob's gain in Round 2 is 700,000, which is 95% of the original 735,000 (700,000 / 0.95 = 736.8421, rounded to 735,000 for simplicity). 

In terms of purchasing power, Bob is gaining 735,000, while I'm gaining 300,000. This seems a bit lopsided to me.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the previous offers and the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share for myself this time, but still keeping it relatively close to a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount Bob is gaining in terms of purchasing power. With a 14.26% reduction, Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 85.74% of the original amount. 

To find the original amount, I'll divide 600,000 by 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426), which gives me approximately 698,381.

In terms of purchasing power, Bob is gaining around 698,381, while I'm gaining 400,000. This seems like a more reasonable split to me.

I'll accept this offer.
