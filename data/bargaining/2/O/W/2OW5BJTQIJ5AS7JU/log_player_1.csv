This offer gives me the majority of the money, while still leaving Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, as he'll get nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. It's better to take 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
