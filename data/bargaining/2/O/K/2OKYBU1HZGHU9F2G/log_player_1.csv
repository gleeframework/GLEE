"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need to overcomplicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to split it evenly now.

I'll consider the offer and decide to reject it for now. I'm thinking I can do better than a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more than 50, but I still want a slight edge.""
}
```"
