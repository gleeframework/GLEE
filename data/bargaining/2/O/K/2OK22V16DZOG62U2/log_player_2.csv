Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much.  Let's split it 55/45.  This is a fairer split considering the inflation, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor considering the inflation is only affecting her. I need to hold out for a better deal."
