Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I want to maximize my share. However, Alice's offer is close to the initial 50/50 split, so I'll try to get a bit more. But I don't want to risk rejecting and losing out on a decent deal. I'll accept this offer.
