"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less for both of us, so I need to think strategically. Since Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly better for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to round 2. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
