"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more than the initial fair split, but I need to keep a majority to compensate for the inflation I'll face in the next round.  Let's end this fairly, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
