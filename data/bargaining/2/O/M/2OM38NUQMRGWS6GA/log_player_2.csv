"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation disadvantage I have. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers in the next round! I want a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more than the initial fair split, but I need to keep a majority to compensate for the inflation I'll face in the next round.  Let's end this fairly, and we both get a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressure you're facing, but your last offer wasn't fair considering the initial split I proposed. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at the value further. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a good compromise. The inflation rate is hitting hard, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
