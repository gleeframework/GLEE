I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  This gives me a good start and hopefully Bob sees that this is a fair offer.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, taking 400,000 is better than getting nothing. With the inflation, the money I would gain in the next round is too risky.  It's time to take what I can get!"
