"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 20%. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can adjust the split in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one, considering the future rounds will have inflation 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 55% of the remaining amount. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit stingy, Bob! I'll try to be more generous, but I'm still looking for a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining amount, leaving Bob with 40%. The message is a playful jab at Bob's previous offer, while still trying to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests in this game 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, while it's not the best deal I've seen, it's getting close to the final rounds, and I'm not sure I can do better. The 55% share is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to take it to avoid risking even less in future rounds."
