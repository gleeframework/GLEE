"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 10, I'll take 90""
}
```

This offer is a generous one, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Fairness is a good starting point, but I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a slightly larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I'm not sure if I can do better than that""
}
```"
