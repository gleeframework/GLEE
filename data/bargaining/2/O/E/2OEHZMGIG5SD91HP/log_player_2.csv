Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good starting point, but it's unlikely Bob will accept a deal where he gets so little. Let's see if we can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split. It's a reasonable starting point, and we can see how Alice responds."
