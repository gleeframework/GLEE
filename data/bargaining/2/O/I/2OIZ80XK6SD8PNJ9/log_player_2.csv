Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We've both lost value due to inflation, so a 50/50 split seems fair.  We can continue to negotiate, but I don't want to keep losing money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
