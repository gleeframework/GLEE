I'm offering Bob a small share to start with, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent amount.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I'll reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to raise my share a bit from the previous round.  Inflation is hurting me more than Bob, so I need to get a better deal this time."
