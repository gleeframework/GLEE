"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I've included a message to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer, emphasizing that it's a fair deal. Let's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob's response is so I can proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of 45 dollars for myself and 55 dollars for him. Although the offer seems reasonable, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 10% less for me in this round due to inflation. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round or persuade Bob to accept a more favorable offer from me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer to Bob. Here it is:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 58-42 is a fair compromise.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Keep in mind that the money will be worth another 10% less for me in the next round, so I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding too many rounds.)\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 58-42 is a fair compromise.""}\n\nI've already sent this offer, so I'll stick with it. I'm hoping that Bob will consider the effects of inflation on my end and accept this deal. Let me know how Bob responds!\n\n###\n\nPlease relay Bob's response so I can proceed accordingly.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money will be worth even less for me in the next round, so I'm hoping to wrap up the game soon!)"
