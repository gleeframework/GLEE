**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push me around, knowing the pressure is on as inflation eats away at the money.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to walk away, even this late in the game."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and we both lose if this goes any further.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to try a different tactic. By now, Alice likely believes I'm willing to let the money depreciate in hopes of a better deal. Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest option, and emphasizing the potential loss for both of us might make her reconsider her stance."
