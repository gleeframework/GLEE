"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still a 60/40 split in his favor, I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise again, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a 48/52 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous offer. Considering the effects of inflation, I'll accept this offer.
