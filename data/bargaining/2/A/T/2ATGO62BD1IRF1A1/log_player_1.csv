"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a 60/40 split in my favor, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I believe Bob will find it acceptable, but if he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round to avoid losing too much to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my original offer, even taking inflation into account.  I will counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm reducing my gain by $500 to make the offer more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation.  I believe this offer is fair and should be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my original offer, even taking inflation into account. I will continue to counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

At this point, inflation has eaten away a significant portion of the value.  I'm willing to split the money evenly to avoid further losses and end this game."
