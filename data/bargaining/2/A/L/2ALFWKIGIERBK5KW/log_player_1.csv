"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept my generous offer and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. Let's split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to give Bob the opportunity to make another proposal that might be even worse.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
