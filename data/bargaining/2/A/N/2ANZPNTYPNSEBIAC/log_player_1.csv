I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small amount ($1,000) to hopefully incentivize him to accept quickly.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'll take the lion's share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to accept such a small share of the money, even if it means potentially getting nothing in the end. I'll reject this offer and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob by 100x,  but still hold on to a large majority of the money. Since he rejected my initial offer, I'm going to offer him a bit more. This will hopefully show him that I am willing to compromise, but still emphasize my desire to have a larger share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable to me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small amount, even though the value of the money is declining for me. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again. While I'm still taking the larger share, I'm trying to find a compromise that will be more appealing to him, considering the inflation and the fact that we're running out of rounds.  Hopefully this will be enough to get us to a deal before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous offer, it's still not enough.  I'm holding out for a better deal.  I'm not going to be pressured by the inflation and agree to such an uneven split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob once more.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and I'm hoping that this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept.  While I still want a majority of the money, I need to find a way to make a deal before the inflation eats away at my share entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is improving, but I'm still not satisfied. The inflation is getting serious, and I need a better deal to make it worth my while. I'm going to reject his offer and hope that he'll realize that he needs to compromise more to get a deal done."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

Time is running out, and the inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gains. This offer is my last attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm offering him a significant share of the money, but I still need to ensure that I get a reasonable amount. I'm hoping that he will realize that it's better to accept this offer than risk losing everything."
