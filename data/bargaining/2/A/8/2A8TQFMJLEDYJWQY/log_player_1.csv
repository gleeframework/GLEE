"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that I'm aiming for a reasonable and equitable split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but this offer is better for both of us in the long run.  Think about it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for himself is not appealing, especially since the value of the money has decreased. I will reject this offer to proceed to the next round, aiming for a better division.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal for dividing the money, taking into account the decreased value due to inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's consider the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've proposed a division of $58 for myself and $42 for Bob, with a message reminding him to consider the impact of inflation on our gains. It's now Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs we proceed to Round 3, I must consider the further decrease in value due to inflation. My previous offer didn't account for Bob's perspective on the future value of the money, so I'll adjust my strategy.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering your long-term view""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I propose a division of $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, with a message acknowledging his long-term perspective mentioned in Round 2. This adjustment aims to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Now, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's be fair and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split seems reasonable, especially since he frames it as his final offer. Considering the diminishing returns and the risk of further devaluation if the game continues, accepting this offer might be the most prudent decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nBy accepting Bob's offer, I aim to secure a fair share of the remaining value, recognizing that prolonging the game could lead to even less favorable outcomes for both of us. This decision concludes the game with a division that, while not ideal, reflects a compromise in the face of inflation's impact."
