"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be willing to take a smaller portion to avoid the risk of getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than getting nothing, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll try to push for a higher percentage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal but am willing to compromise. I'm also factoring in the inflation, and trying to secure a significant amount before it affects me too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to the inflation. I think I can still get a better deal for myself by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm sticking to a similar strategy as before: offering a slightly higher percentage than the previous round, hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also trying to secure a significant amount before the inflation impacts me too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, this is getting closer to an even split and Bob might not be willing to negotiate further. I'm taking this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the end."
