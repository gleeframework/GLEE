Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000

```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While I'd ideally like a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round I reject an offer, the value of my potential winnings decreases significantly. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice seems determined to get a favorable deal and might continue to offer progressively worse splits.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now guarantees me a reasonable sum. Rejecting it risks getting an even lower amount in future rounds, or even nothing if we fail to agree. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes it's better to take a decent offer than risk ending up with nothing."
