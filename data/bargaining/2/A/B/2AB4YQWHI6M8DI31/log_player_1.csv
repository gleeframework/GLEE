"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by being generous (but not too generous) and offer Bob a small amount. This way, I can hopefully secure most of the money and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 50$ now than risk getting nothing later."
