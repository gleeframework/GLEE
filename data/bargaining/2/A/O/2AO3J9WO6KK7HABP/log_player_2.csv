``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent amount of money, I believe I can get more by playing a few more rounds and seeing what Alice is willing to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob, but your offer was too low. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still too low, and while I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still confident I can get a better deal by playing a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to be more flexible, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""}
```"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this is closer to what I want, I'm still losing too much to inflation. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next few rounds."
