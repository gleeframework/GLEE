"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1. I'm willing to give you a generous share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice. I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's go 60/40.  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of our contributions. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain.

I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the numbers. This is my best offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
