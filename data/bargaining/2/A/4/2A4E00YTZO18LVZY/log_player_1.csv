Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
