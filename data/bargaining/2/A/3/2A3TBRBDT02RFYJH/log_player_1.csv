"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the money equally, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have the smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share of the money!

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I deserve a larger share. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount of money, in the hopes that he'll accept this compromise!"
