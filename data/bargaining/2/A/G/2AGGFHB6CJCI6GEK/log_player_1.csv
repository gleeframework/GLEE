"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm now getting 90% of the value I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob is getting 90% of the value he would have gotten in the first round, but only 90% of that 90% for Alice, so 81% of the original value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll accept Bob's offer to end the game.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
