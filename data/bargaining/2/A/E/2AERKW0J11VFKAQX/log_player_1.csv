"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a 65/35 split. Let's be fair, but I'm also hoping to maximize my share. I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the actual values I'd get are:

* My gain: $3,500 x 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation) = $3,325
* Bob's gain: $6,500 x 1 (unknown inflation, but I'll assume it's the same as mine for now) = $6,500

I'm not thrilled about the 65/35 split, but I'm not getting a better offer anytime soon. I'll have to make a decision.
