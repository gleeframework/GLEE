Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a larger share since I'm taking on more risk with the inflation. This offer still gives you a decent amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll budge a bit, but I think 40/60 is a more reasonable split given the inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40
