"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio. However, I'll take a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to take a slightly larger share to make up for the loss in value. I'll also take into account that Alice's offer is similar to the previous ones, so I'll try to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money by 36% again, so the money is worth 64% of its original value. I'll aim to take a larger share to compensate for this.
