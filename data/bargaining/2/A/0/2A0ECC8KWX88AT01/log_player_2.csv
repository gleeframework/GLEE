"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but my offer is more reasonable for us both.""}"

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing a lot to inflation. Meet me halfway and we can end this. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to frame this as ""meeting halfway,"" the value lost to inflation means she's still getting a significantly better deal than Bob. It's important to remain firm and continue pushing for a more equitable split, even with the time pressure."
