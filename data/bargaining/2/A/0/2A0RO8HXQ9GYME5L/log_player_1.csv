"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want a better deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. With the 400,000 I'll get, I'll be getting a smaller percentage of the total amount, but it's still a decent offer.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give to Bob, but still trying to keep a slight advantage. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to re-evaluate the offer. With the 300,000 I'll get, I'll be getting an even smaller percentage of the total amount.

However, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives Bob a 700,000 gain. It's a significant advantage, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 320000, ""bob_gain"": 680000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give to Bob again, but still trying to keep a decent share for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
