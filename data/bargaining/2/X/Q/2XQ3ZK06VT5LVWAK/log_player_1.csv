"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 80/20 in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know what Bob's expectations are."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, my gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of the value of my gain in round 1, so I'll actually get $4,500.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is as fair as he thinks it is, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 81% of the value of my gain in round 1, so I'll get $6,480 (80% of $8,100, which is 90% of $8,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
