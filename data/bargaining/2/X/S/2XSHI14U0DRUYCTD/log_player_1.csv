Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's go for 60/40 in my favor.  I'm taking into account the inflation rate that affects us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob claims to consider the inflation rate, his offer is heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting this deal would leave me with significantly less value than I could potentially secure by negotiating further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a larger hit from inflation. 55/45 reflects the shrinking value and gets us both a decent deal.""
