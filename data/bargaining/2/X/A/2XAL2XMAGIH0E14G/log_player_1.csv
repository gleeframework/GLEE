"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll be eager to negotiate and we can revisit the division in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to start with a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can move on to the next round."
