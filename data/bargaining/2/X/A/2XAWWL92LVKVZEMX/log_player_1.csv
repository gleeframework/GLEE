"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, offering Bob a smaller share this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said you wanted to take the smaller share last round, so I'll take a bigger share this time. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I don't think I want to accept an 80-20 split, as it's not favorable to me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the second round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to find a middle ground, let's meet in the middle this round.""
}
```"
