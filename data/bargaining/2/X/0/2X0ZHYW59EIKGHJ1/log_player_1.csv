"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, don't you think?""
}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair split, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'm tempted to accept it. It's a more even split than my initial offer, and it's a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer!

""decision"": ""accept""
