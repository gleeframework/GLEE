"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too far. This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
