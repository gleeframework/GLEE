Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, don't you? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob. Let's compromise. I'll take a little less, but you'll get a bit more.  We can call it a day.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering the inflation is affecting you more. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is less than what I would ideally want, given the inflation, accepting it is the best strategy to secure some gain.  The further rounds go on, the less money I'll get."
