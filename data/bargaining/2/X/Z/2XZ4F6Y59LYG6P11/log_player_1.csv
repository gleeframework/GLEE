"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. I'm keeping a slight majority, but giving Bob a fair share. Since the money decreases in value more for him, he might be more likely to accept this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even taking inflation into account. I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me less than I offered in the first round, especially since the money is losing value faster for him than it is for me. I'll reject and see if he can offer me something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

Since my previous offer was rejected, and inflation is affecting Bob more, I'm adjusting my offer slightly. I'm decreasing my share by $500 to make it more appealing to Bob, while still ensuring I get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money has lost a significant value due to inflation, Bob's offer is better than my last offer, and the loss in value is much higher for him. I'll accept his offer to ensure I get at least something."
