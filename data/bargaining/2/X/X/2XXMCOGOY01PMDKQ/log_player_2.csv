Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm meeting you closer to the middle, but this needs to end soon.  We both lose if we don't agree now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly nervous and pushing for a deal, but the offer still heavily favors her. While the shrinking pot due to inflation is a factor, it's better to hold out for a better deal a little longer.  We're getting close to the point where Alice should be getting very concerned."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and by taking a firm stance, we might make Alice realize that continued stalling will hurt her more than it hurts us.  We're emphasizing the shrinking pot and making it clear we're willing to walk away if she doesn't agree to a reasonable deal."
