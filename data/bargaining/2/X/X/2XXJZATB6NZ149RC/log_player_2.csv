It's a 100% loss for me.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I'm offering you 10 dollars, but it's better than nothing.  Let's make a deal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. A fair start to the next round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal, getting 50% of the money is better than getting nothing.  Let's see if we can negotiate better in future rounds."
