"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair split. Take 1000 and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is not fair, and I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I think that's a fair start.""}\n\n###\nI'm making a counteroffer that gives me a larger share, but still leaves a significant amount for Alice. I'm hoping she'll see this as a reasonable compromise and accept. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the proposed split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 55-45 this time.  I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation factor is starting to take effect, but I'm willing to take the risk to try and get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I see we're getting closer. How about we flip the 55-45 split in my favor this time?""}\n\n###\nI'm making another counteroffer, this time taking the same split Alice proposed in the previous round but flipping it in my favor. I'm trying to build on the momentum of the previous offers and see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway. The message acknowledges the progress we've made so far and tries to persuade Alice to accept this new proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and end this already. I'm sure we can both agree that's the best outcome for us right now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of an even split. Given the inflation factor, the money I gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, which means that the 5000 I'm getting now is equivalent to approximately 4072.50 in the first round. However, I believe that continuing to negotiate further will only lead to more losses due to inflation, and there's a risk that Alice might not make another offer as good as this one. Therefore, I'm choosing to accept this offer and end the game."
