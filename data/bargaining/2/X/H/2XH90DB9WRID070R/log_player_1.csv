"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining $8,000 in future rounds""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small initial share to get the game started, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can negotiate further in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair starting point, let's see if we can find a better split later! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I want a bigger share""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth even less now. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it roughly evenly""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're losing money with each round, so let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value so quickly, I think an even split is a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it evenly and move on""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer and hoping we can both get a decent share of the remaining money."
