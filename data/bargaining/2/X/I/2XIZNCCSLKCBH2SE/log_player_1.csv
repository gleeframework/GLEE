"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much just yet.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial proposal, Alice. Here's a more balanced split for our first round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time around.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can move on to the next round."
