"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll consider Bob's offer and think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Time to take control, let's make a move""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split in my favor, which is a more aggressive offer considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and avoid further losses 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of money so significantly, I need to be very cautious. A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Let me think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm not sure if I can do better, but I'd like to try."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a significant toll, I need to be very strategic with my next move. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A slight concession, but I'm still in control""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be careful not to give up too much. Considering the reduced value of money, a 45-55 split is actually a relatively good offer for me.

Let me think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting a worse deal."
