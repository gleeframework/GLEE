Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, hoping I'll panic as inflation eats into my potential gains. However, she's still being too greedy. I need to hold firm and aim for a better deal in the next few rounds.  We're past the halfway point, so the pressure is on both of us."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being more than fair 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is barely budging, and while the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial value due to inflation. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll get more nervous as we approach the final rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being very generous, Bob. Don't let inflation eat away at your share 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The game has taken a turn for the worse.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Inflation has eroded my potential gains significantly, and if I reject this, I risk walking away with nothing. It's better to secure something now than gamble on a better offer in the few remaining rounds and risk getting nothing at all."
