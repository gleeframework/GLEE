"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob accepts or wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so the effective amount I'd gain is 30 * 0.95 = 28.5.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I think I'm the one who deserves the majority! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. In this round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd gain is 15 * 0.854 (1 - 0.1426) = 12.81.

Considering the significant difference in the proposed splits, I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll make a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the division."
