"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand your position, but my previous offer was already generous. This is 52/48 in my favor -  it minimizes our losses from inflation.  Accepting this now is the smartest move for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
