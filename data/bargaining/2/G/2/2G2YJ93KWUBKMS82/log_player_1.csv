Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting a bit impatient, Alice. This is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on and inflation is eating into our potential gains, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm betting he'll be more open to a fairer deal as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting both of us, but I think I deserve the bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the game has shifted considerably:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. 
* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer this goes on, the more I lose proportionally to Bob. His lower inflation rate means time is on his side. 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better, and he's clearly aiming for a larger share.

While not ideal, accepting guarantees a payout, even with the inflation, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if the negotiation completely fails."
