Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. I'll see if I can get a better deal in future rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is way too unbalanced! I'm not going to accept such a low payout, even with the inflation factor. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm sticking to a similar strategy as before, but I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation. I believe this offer is still fair and might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, considering the amount of inflation that's occurred. I'm holding out for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer further to account for the increasing inflation, but still offering a substantial share to Bob.  I hope this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't accept a ridiculously unfair deal."
