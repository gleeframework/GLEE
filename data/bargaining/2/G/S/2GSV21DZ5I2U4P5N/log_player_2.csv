# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the value of the money will decrease with each round. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease over time. Let's make a deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than last round. Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, I'm still confident I can get a more favorable deal.  I'm going to see if I can push for a more even split, considering the inflation factor is working in my favor now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose money with each passing round, so let's end this before it's too late.""}
