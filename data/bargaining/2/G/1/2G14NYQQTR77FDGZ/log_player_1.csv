"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value, my proposed gain of 70 is now worth 56, and Bob's proposed gain of 30 is still 30.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split.
