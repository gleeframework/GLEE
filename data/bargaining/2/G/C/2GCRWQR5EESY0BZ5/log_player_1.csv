"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get 6,000 and Bob gets 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't like the fact that Bob is getting a larger share than me, but considering the inflation, I think it's a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
