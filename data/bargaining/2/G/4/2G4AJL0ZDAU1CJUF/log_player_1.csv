"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing,  it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower share to Bob, hoping he'll take it after rejecting my first offer. The inflation has decreased the value of the money for me, so I need to be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money for me.  I'm better off accepting this offer, even though it's significantly less than what I was initially aiming for.  I'm going to take what I can get at this point."
