"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the smaller share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $3000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not too thrilled about it, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
