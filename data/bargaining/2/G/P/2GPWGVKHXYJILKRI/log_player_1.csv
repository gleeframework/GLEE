"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a slightly aggressive first offer. I want a significant portion of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with a reasonable amount, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation hit me harder than I anticipated, but I'm willing to risk another round to potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that his offer was too aggressive and be willing to compromise."
