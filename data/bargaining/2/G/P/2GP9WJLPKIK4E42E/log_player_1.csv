Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was kind, Alice, but doesn't account for the inflation. Let's split 55-45, it's fairer considering the money will be worth less next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
