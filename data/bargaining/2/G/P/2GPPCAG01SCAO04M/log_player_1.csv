"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 dollars for myself, considering the inflation that affects both of us. This way, we both get a decent share, and it's better for Bob to accept now rather than risking further loss due to inflation in the next rounds.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split, considering the inflation will affect me more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better share. Since the money is worth less for both of us, I want to try to maximize my gain in the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering we both lose value each round, this is a fairer split.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share slightly, considering that the value of the money decreases with each round. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better to accept this offer rather than risking an even lower value in the next round.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Any further rounds will hurt us both. Let's split evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us, I believe accepting Bob's offer of an even split is the best decision at this point. Further rounds will indeed hurt us both, and I don't see a better opportunity for gain in continuing negotiations.\n\n###"
