I'm offering Bob a small share to hopefully incentivize him to accept in the first round.  This way, I get the majority of the money and don't have to worry about inflation eating away at my share in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him, but it's still too low for me. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, offering him 100,000. This is still a significant gain for him, and it's more than he got in the previous round. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable for him, but I'm still not convinced.  There's a good chance he'll be willing to accept a similar offer from me next round, and I'm hoping to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway again, offering him 200,000. This is still a significant gain for him, and it's more than he got in the previous round. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept, as we're getting close to the point where inflation could start to hurt me significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable to him, but I'm still not convinced. I'm hoping to get a larger share, and I'm not willing to accept this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to continue to try and meet Bob halfway, offering him 300,000.  This is still a significant gain for him, even with the inflation, and it's more than he got in the previous round. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I need to make sure we reach an agreement before inflation really starts to hurt my share."
