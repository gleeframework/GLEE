"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is fair, considering the money will be worth less in the next round if Bob declines. I'm hoping to secure a good deal while giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this a decent offer. I'm willing to accept it and end the game."
