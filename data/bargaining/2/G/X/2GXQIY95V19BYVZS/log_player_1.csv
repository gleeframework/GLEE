"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000. This is a fair starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can take the smaller share, I'll take the larger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I can do better than 4000. I'll make a new proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more of the pie to try to find a compromise. I think 4500 is a reasonable amount for me, and 5500 is a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'll give you a chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. The gap between our proposed shares is getting too large, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of Bob taking 7000 and me only getting 3000. I think I can do better than this. I'll make a new proposal in Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground again, and I think 4200 is a reasonable amount for me, and 5800 is a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to getting nothing, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. The gap between our proposed shares is huge, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of Bob taking 8000 and me only getting 2000. I think I can do better than this. I'll make a new proposal in Round 7.

I'm also getting a bit concerned that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll need to make a more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 again, before it's too late""}

I'm going back to the original 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in not letting the inflation eat away at the value of the money. I'm willing to take a risk and propose a split that's more equal, hoping that Bob will see the wisdom in it."
