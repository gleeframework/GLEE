"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-10 split, but I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
