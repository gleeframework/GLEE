"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep 900,000 for myself and give Bob 100,000. This way, I get the majority of the money while still offering Bob a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Bob's offer is fair, and if I reject, there is no guarantee he will offer me more in the next round. With inflation, the value of the money will decrease for both of us, and there is a chance we might not get anything at all if we keep rejecting offers."
