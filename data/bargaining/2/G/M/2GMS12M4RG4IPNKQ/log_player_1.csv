"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less this round, I'm now considering the offer in terms of the reduced value.

In this case, I'd be getting 50 units of money that are 20% less valuable than the 80 units I could have gotten in the first round. So, in terms of the reduced value, I'd be getting 40 units of the original money (50 * 0.8 = 40).

However, I'm not sure about Bob's perspective, and I don't want to give up the chance to get more. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the original $100 (80% of 80% of the original value), I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm trying to get a higher share this round, considering the reduced value of the money."
