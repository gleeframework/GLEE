Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance now. With the inflation eating away my share, I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile. Let's end this, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Alright, Bob.  60/40 it is.  It's getting too risky to let this go any longer."" 
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**  

While not ideal, Bob's offer is the same as my initial proposal in round 1, but the value has significantly decreased due to inflation. It's clear Bob is prioritizing his own gains and is unlikely to budge much further. Accepting now guarantees I receive something, whereas continuing the game risks getting nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement."
