4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try a 55/45 split, Alice. It's more reasonable considering the inflation hits me harder.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  We both lose if this drags on.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation, I need a bigger share. How about 58/42? It's getting urgent for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the urgency, but that offer is heavily skewed in your favor. We need to find a more balanced solution.",Alice,4,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, we need to settle this quickly! I'm proposing a 57/43 split. It's a slight edge for me, acknowledging the inflation impact, but still a fair deal for both.",Alice,5,
