This offer ensures that I receive the vast majority of the money and allows for minimal risk in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer aims to significantly increase my share while still giving Bob a small amount, potentially incentivizing him to accept and avoid further inflation affecting his share."
