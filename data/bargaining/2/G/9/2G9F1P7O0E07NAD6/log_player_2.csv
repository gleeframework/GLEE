"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but this is a fair split considering the inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, I want to propose a deal that feels more balanced and encourages her to accept.
* **Inflation:** By highlighting the inflation factor, I'm reminding Alice that delaying a decision will cost both of us money. My offer gives her a slightly larger share than she would get if she rejected and I offered a 50/50 split in the next round (due to the 5% devaluation)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now much closer to a reasonable split. Accepting avoids further losses due to inflation."
