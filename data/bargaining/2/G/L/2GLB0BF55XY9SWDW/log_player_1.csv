"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a better deal too. I'll give you 450000, and I'll take 550000.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll aim to get a bit more to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 460000,
  ""bob_gain"": 540000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect now, I need to be careful not to give away too much. Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, but I'll consider it. I'll try to get a bit more to make up for the lost value.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is not much different from the previous one, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best deal. I'll give you 490000, and I'll take 510000.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll aim to get a bit more to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 495000,
  ""bob_gain"": 505000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation. This is my final offer.""
}
