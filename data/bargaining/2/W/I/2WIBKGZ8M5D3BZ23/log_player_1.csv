"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, isn't it?

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more even split to try to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than this. The money I'd gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 64.16% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even more conservative split to try to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
