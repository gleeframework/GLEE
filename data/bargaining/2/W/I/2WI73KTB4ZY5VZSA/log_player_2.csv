Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

```

Explanation:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Delaying further significantly hurts both players, but especially Alice due to her higher inflation rate.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is likely aware that she's losing value quickly. Her offer, while still favoring her, is closer to an even split than her initial proposal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means Bob risks getting an even worse deal in Round 4 when the value decreases further. It's unlikely Alice will offer anything significantly better than this given the inflation. 

Bob needs to cut his losses and accept this offer before inflation eats away at the potential gains even more.
