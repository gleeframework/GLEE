"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in favor of Alice.  This seems fair, as I have the first proposal, and I am giving a significant portion of the money to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is much worse for me than the first one. I'm willing to negotiate but this is unacceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  While this is still a large majority of the money for me, I'm recognizing Bob's rejection of my first offer and attempting to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the offer.  It's still more advantageous to Bob than to me.  I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm again reducing my offer, but I am trying to be fair by giving Bob a larger share. We are nearing the end of the game, and the value of the money is declining rapidly.  I hope this offer will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is closer to a 50/50 split than previous ones, it still favors Bob.  I will continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making another attempt at a compromise. I'm reducing my share again, but I'm also recognizing that we are running out of time. With each passing round, the value of the money we can earn decreases, so I believe this offer is fair and in both our best interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the closest we've been to a 50/50 split, and with only a few rounds left, the value of the money is dwindling too quickly.  I accept."
