"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'll start with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share. This might encourage him to accept quickly, preventing much inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my previous offer. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'll lower my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. This might incentivize him to accept, and hopefully avoids further inflation."

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though inflation has hit hard, Bob's offer is still not good enough for me. I'll keep rejecting and try to get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm taking a bit more risk here, hoping that Bob will see the value of getting something rather than nothing with the inflation growing."

Bob's offer:

Even with the significant inflation, Bob's offer is still not acceptable. I'll continue to push for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm still aiming for a decent share, but I need to make sure it's appealing to Bob while accounting for the growing inflation."
