Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering we're both taking a risk in this game. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still a significant gain. The 20% inflation means it's more advantageous to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
