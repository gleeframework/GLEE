Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I'm also willing to share a little bit to get this done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to take half now than risk losing more money to inflation in the next round."
