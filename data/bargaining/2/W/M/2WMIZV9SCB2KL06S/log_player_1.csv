"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose that I take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000. This seems like a fair initial offer, considering the potential for inflation in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is better than risking getting nothing due to inflation and Bob's potential stubbornness."
