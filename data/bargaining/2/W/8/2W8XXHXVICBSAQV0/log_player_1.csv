I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving Bob a little something to make him think about accepting.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is worth less because of inflation, I can do better than $1,000. I'm willing to take the risk of negotiating further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still aiming for a larger portion for myself. Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt now. I can't afford to be too greedy. I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting a smaller share, it's better than nothing at this point."
