"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 5% less now!

I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think of this 52-48 split?""
}
```"
