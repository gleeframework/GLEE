"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to divide the money.  Accept this and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $4,000.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is fair, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer: 60/40 in my favor.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $5,120.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still not convinced, Bob. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical.  Inflation is taking its toll, and we both need to be reasonable.  I'm offering you a fair share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount as well.  Accept this and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $3,200.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, but I'm not convinced that I can do better. I'll consider this offer.

However, I'd like to make sure I'm not being taken advantage of. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal, trying to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer: 55/45 in my favor.""
