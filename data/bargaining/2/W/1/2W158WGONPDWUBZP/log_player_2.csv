Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

The game is designed to put Bob at a disadvantage.  He's facing a ticking clock in the form of inflation. Every round that he rejects an offer, the potential value of his share decreases. 

Let's analyze why accepting in Round 5 is the best (or least bad) option remaining:

* **Round 5 Offer:** Bob gets $3800 (worth 34.39% less than its original value).
* **Potential Future Offers:**  Alice knows Bob is desperate. She's likely to offer even less in subsequent rounds.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in the hope of a slightly better one is too risky.  The inflation will eat away at any potential gains.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice is acting rationally and to maximize her gains.  There's always a chance she could offer a surprisingly good deal in a later round, but it's a gamble."
