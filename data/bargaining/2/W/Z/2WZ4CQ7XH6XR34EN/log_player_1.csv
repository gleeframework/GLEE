"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping we can do better than this in future rounds!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equal distribution this time. Let's see if we can agree on this or try to improve it in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share would be worth 20% less than the original 80, so I'd actually get $64.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to settle for 40% yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the more equal distribution, but I'm hoping to do even better. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my previous 64 is now worth 16% less, so I'd get $51.2 in this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```"
