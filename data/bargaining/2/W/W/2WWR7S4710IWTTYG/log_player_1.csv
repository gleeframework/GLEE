"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept.  I'll see if I can get more in the future rounds.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, but I'm hoping for a better deal. I know the money is worth less to me each round, but I'm willing to risk it for a chance at a larger share. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 this round.  I'm hoping that the threat of inflation and the possibility of getting nothing at all will motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I am losing value with each round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. This offer from Bob is still far less than what I would have gotten in the first round, and I'm confident I can get closer to a 50/50 split. I'll keep pushing for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of offering a slightly better deal for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  The risk of getting nothing is increasing, but I'm confident I can still get a good outcome if I play my cards right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm losing value quickly, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to come to an agreement sooner rather than later.  I'm going to keep pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm finally offering a 50/50 split.  The inflation is starting to seriously hurt, and I think Bob might be starting to feel the pressure.  I'm hoping he'll recognize that this is a fair deal and accept it.  If not, we're both going to lose a lot of money."
