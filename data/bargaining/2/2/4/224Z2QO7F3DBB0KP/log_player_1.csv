Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be reasonable. I take 60%, you take 40%.  This is generous considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
