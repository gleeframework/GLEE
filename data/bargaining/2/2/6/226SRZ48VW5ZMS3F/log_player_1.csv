"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, taking 90% and leaving Bob with 10%.  I want to see if he'll accept, but I'm also aware that the money is worth less each round, so I need to be firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $10, I know that the money is worth less each round, and I have a better chance of getting a better deal later on.  I'm also aware that Bob's offer is likely based on the inflated value of his money, so I need to be careful."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 20% of the money. This is still a significant reduction from my first offer, but I'm willing to compromise a little bit. I'm hoping that he'll realize that he's not going to get 90% of the money and will be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even though I've lost a lot of value due to inflation,  Bob's offer is still too low. I'm hoping I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 30% of the money. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a fair share. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the declining value, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize he needs to negotiate more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Although I've lost a lot of value from inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for only 30% of the money, especially with only a few rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  We're getting close to the end, and I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to negotiate."
