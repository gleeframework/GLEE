"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your split seems a bit off, how about this slightly more equitable arrangement?  It's the best you'll get from me.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting it, we signal we understand the game's dynamics and won't accept unfair deals.  The decreasing value of the money puts pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable (But Still Greedy):**  Offering slightly more than a 50/50 split in our favor might seem ""fair"" at first glance to Alice, but it heavily favors us due to the faster devaluation she faces. 
* **Finality:** The message aims to create a sense of urgency and finality. This might push Alice to accept, fearing an even worse offer in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse one later.
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** Alice's move to a 50/50 split shows she's feeling the pressure of the devaluation. It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better in subsequent rounds. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Rejecting this offer opens us up to the risk of Alice proposing an even worse deal in a future round, where the money's value will be even lower."
