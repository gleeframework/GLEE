I'm starting with a generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly less than what I was initially offering. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to a fair division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to compensate for the inflation, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. I believe this shows good faith and hopefully encourages a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hurt Bob more significantly, his offer is still relatively fair considering how much the money is worth now.  It's better to accept and secure a good portion of the money than to risk further rounds and potentially lose more."
