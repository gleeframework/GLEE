"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the money, and Bob will get 20%. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is the opposite of mine, I'll accept it to get a larger share of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
