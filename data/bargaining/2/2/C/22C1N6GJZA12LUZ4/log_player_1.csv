"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I'll try to increase your share in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $270,000 (90% of $300,000)
Bob gain: $980,000 (80% of $1,225,000)

I'm not thrilled about the large difference in our gains, but I'm willing to give Bob a chance to increase my share in future rounds. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
