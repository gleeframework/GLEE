"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in the first round was rejected, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $5,400.

Bob's offer is $5,000, which is less than my current effective gain. I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my effective gain from the previous round is now worth 90% of its value from the second round, which is $4,950.

Considering the current situation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $6,000 and keeping $4,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The rejection continues!

Let's calculate my effective gain from the previous round, considering the 90% value from the second round, and then the 72.9% value from the third round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). This means my effective gain from the third round is now worth 0.729 * $4,950 = $3,615.15.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll accept this offer.
