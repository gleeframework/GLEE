```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I think I'm in a better position. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I should take this offer. It's a good opportunity to lock in a decent amount of value.
