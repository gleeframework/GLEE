"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 40% less than my original share, which I thought was a good deal. But now, with Bob's offer, I'm getting the same amount as him, which is a 50-50 split. That's a better deal for me, considering the inflation.
