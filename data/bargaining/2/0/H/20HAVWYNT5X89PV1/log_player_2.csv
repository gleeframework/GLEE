"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I think this is a good starting point for us to discuss. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  The inflation factor means the money will be worth less with each passing round, so I want to make sure I get the best possible deal before the value drops too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I think we can both do better. Let's try a more even split this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. The inflation is starting to hit hard, and while I'd prefer to get a slightly better deal, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is fair, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
