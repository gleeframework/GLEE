"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 80:20 is a fair split considering the inflation factor. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
