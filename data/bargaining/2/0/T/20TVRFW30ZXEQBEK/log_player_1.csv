"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can see how the game plays out from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for Bob, he's trying to take advantage of the situation. My gain is still $5,000, but Bob's gain is now $6,000.

I'll reject this offer, since it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $6,000, and my original offer was $5,000, I'll try to meet him halfway. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still not getting a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! His gain is worth significantly less than my original offer, and his offer is still not as favorable to me as my original proposal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the original split, Bob. Let's meet in the middle again""
