"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The price of being greedy is going down!

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50-50 split, and I'm happy to get out of this negotiation with a decent amount of money!"
