This offer gives me a larger share, but still allows for a negotiation. I am confident that I can get a better deal in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
``` 

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, aiming for a compromise.  Since the money is losing value for me, I need to secure a decent amount, but I'm also willing to concede some ground to avoid a potential stalemate."
