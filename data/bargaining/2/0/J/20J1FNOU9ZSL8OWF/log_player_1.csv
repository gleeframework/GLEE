"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll start by offering a division that seems fair, considering the conditions. I'll offer Bob a bit more since the money doesn't lose value for him, but I also want to make sure I get a significant portion since the value decreases for me with each round. Here's my offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering inflation.""}\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more efficient with this division. Let's start with a more even split, but consider that the value of the money changes each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nLet's evaluate Bob's offer considering the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money loses 5% of its value each round for me, I need to factor this into my decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: The offer doesn't sufficiently account for the loss in value I experience due to inflation. I believe a more balanced approach, taking into account the decreasing value for me, is necessary. Let's proceed to see if we can find a more equitable division."

Round 3

# Alice gain: 3900 
# Bob gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 4\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation on my gain and Bob's slight adjustment, I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus continuing negotiations.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although Bob has made a slight adjustment, the offer still doesn't fully compensate for the loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation. With the money losing 14.26% of its value for me, I believe it's crucial to push for a division that better accounts for this disparity. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to find a more equitable solution."

# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although Bob has slightly increased his offer, the impact of inflation on my gain is becoming increasingly significant. With the money now worth 22.62% less for me than in the first round, I feel that accepting this offer would still leave me at a considerable disadvantage.
