Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should take this, the value is indeed decreasing rapidly for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point.  Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob due to inflation (now at a 34.39% reduction). Waiting longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice has consistently rejected offers that are more generous than this one. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better for Bob. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a high chance he'll be forced to accept even less in subsequent rounds, potentially ending up with a paltry sum. 

While 42 is less than desired, accepting now cuts losses and avoids the risk of ending up with even less.
