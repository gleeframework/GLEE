Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to your desperation, but I'll give you a fair share if you're willing to meet me halfway!

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to meet him in the middle.

```
{

}
```

I think this is a good opportunity to end the game with a decent share, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'd rather take this than risk going into the next round with a lower chance of getting a better deal."
