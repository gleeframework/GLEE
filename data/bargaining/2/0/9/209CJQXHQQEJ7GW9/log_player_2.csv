"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the initial split seems fair, Alice is losing value at a much faster rate than I am due to inflation. I can likely get a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you're losing value faster, Alice. How about this slightly adjusted offer?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's a fairer solution considering the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is catching on to the inflation disadvantage, but it's still heavily in my favor.  A 50/50 split now is better than in earlier rounds, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This offer gives us both something. Let's be realistic.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 40/60, acknowledging the inflation affecting both of us.  This gives us both a share and keeps the game moving. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to accept. While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is eating away at the value, and Alice's offer is now better than what I proposed last round. If I reject and things go south, I risk ending up with nothing."
