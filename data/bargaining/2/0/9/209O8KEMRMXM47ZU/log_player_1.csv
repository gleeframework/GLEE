"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 400,000 dollars and leave 600,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I need to think carefully about whether this offer is better than making another proposal.

I'll reject this offer.
