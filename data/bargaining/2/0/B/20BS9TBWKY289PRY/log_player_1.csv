Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a risky move, but I'm aiming for a quick win.  I'm offering Bob a small amount to see if he'll accept it quickly and avoid the inflation that will hurt him more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a significant portion of my initial gain, accepting is the best choice. The inflation will hit Bob harder with each round, making it unlikely he'll make a better offer in the future."
