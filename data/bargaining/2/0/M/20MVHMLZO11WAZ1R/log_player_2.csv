Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste any more time. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option, especially considering the increasing effects of inflation. Take the deal while it's still worthwhile.

# Alice gain: 500000
