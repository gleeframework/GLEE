"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a good start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't settle for just 10% of the money. I'll take my chances and propose a more equitable split in the next round.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, roughly.""}\n\nI'm offering a more balanced split, taking into account that Alice initially proposed a significantly higher share for herself. Given the 5% inflation, it's in both our interests to conclude the game sooner rather than later. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Alice has moved closer to a more equitable split, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to take a risk and propose another offer in the next round, hoping to get a slightly better deal.\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision, and I'll prepare a new proposal for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a mutually beneficial agreement quickly.""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. My offer is slightly more generous to myself than the previous one, considering Alice's last proposal and the pressure of inflation. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Alice, allowing us to conclude the game."
