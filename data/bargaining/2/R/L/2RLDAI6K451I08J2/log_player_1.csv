I'm going to start with a generous offer, aiming to secure the deal quickly. I'll give Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I have to accept his offer if I want to get anything at all.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to reach a compromise.  While I still want a larger portion, I need to be mindful of the inflation factor and the fact that Bob's offer was very unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and his offer is still way too lopsided.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to up my offer again.  The inflation is starting to become a real factor, and I need to secure some of the money.  This is a big concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob is still being extremely unreasonable.  I'm not going to let him bully me into accepting such an unfair offer.  I'm going to try to hold out for something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to make one last big push for a favorable deal.  The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob's offer, and I'm betting he'll be more willing to compromise at this point.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to accept whatever he proposes in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer than the previous rounds.  Although it's not ideal, I'm willing to accept an even split to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. The inflation is making it dangerous to hold out for more."
