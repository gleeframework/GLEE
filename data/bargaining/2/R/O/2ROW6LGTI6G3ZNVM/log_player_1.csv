"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting you, but a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
