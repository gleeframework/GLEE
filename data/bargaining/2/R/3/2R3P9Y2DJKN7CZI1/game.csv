55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to budge a bit, but I still think we should aim for a more equal split. How about 55/45?  Let's not get too greedy this early on.",Alice,3,

60.0,40.0,"Let's get serious.  I'm willing to increase my share a bit more, but you need to be realistic about the inflation. We only have a few rounds left. How about 60/40?",Alice,5,
