"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Last chance, Alice. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really running out of time now, Bob. This is my final offer 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are really hurting Bob's potential gains. Accepting a 30/70 split is far from ideal, but waiting another round means potentially getting even less. Alice knows time is on her side and is unlikely to offer anything better."
