Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\nHow's that? I made the first offer, giving myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000, with a message trying to persuade him that it's a fair split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Also, Bob is trying to rush me, but I'm not falling for it! Let's see what happens in the next round."

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, I'm trying to put some pressure on him to accept my offer. I've increased my share to $650,000, and decreased Bob's share to $350,000. Will he bite?"

# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not intimidated by Bob's ""last chance"" message. Since the money is still worth the same for me, I can keep trying to get a better deal. Also, Bob's share is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so he's getting desperate. I'll hold out for a better offer. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

This is my final offer""}\n\nI'm taking advantage of Bob's desperation and the fact that the money is worth even less for him now. I've increased my share to $700,000 and decreased Bob's share to $300,000. Will he finally accept?"
