"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd rather get a bit more now than wait for a potentially lower offer later.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
