"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering I was willing to give him $40 in the first round. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, my gain is now worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! You can do better than that.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth significantly less. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out.

However, Bob's offer is still not very generous, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I need to be even more careful. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, but not too extreme, since I still want to leave room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to be fair, Bob. 50/50 is the way to go.""
}
