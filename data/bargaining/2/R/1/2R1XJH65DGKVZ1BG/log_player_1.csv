"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

After calculating the new values due to inflation, I see that the offer is:

* Alice gets $3,000 (worth 90% of the initial $3,333)
* Bob gets $7,000 (worth 70% of the initial $10,000)

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm open to a compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","After calculating the new values due to inflation, I see that the offer is:

* Bob gets $6,000 (worth 60% of the initial $10,000)

I'll accept this offer, as it's getting closer to the original proposal I made in Round 1.
