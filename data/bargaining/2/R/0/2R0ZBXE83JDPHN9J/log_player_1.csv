"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I'm proposing a more advantageous split for me this time. Consider that the value decreases for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round in hopes of getting a more favorable split.\n\nPlease let Bob know that I reject his offer and I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share.""}\n\nI'm taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for me now, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. I'm still hoping to get a bit more than half, considering I'm making the proposal.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response."
