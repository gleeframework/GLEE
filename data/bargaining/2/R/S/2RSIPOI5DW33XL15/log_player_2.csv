Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on inflation, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle. A 60/40 split is still fair, considering the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, she's pushing for an advantage in the long run.  I need to hold firm to get a better split, as the inflation will continue to hurt me more than her."
