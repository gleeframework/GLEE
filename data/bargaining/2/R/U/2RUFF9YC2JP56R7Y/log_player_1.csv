"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1 and keeping $999,999 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking the deal and ending the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! But I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll let Bob know that I'm not accepting his offer, and it's his turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, Bob, but I'm not done yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, but keeping the lion's share of $900,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will take it or leave it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a good deal, Alice, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being a bit more greedy now, huh? I can live with that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'm getting $250,000 and Bob's getting $750,000. It's a decent split, and I'm happy to end the game here!"
