"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we split the money 3:2 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's risky to accept this early on, as the inflation will likely affect the value of the money more in later rounds.  I'd rather see what Alice is willing to offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
