"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can have 60% and I'll take 40%. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of $6,000, which is $4,800, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 95% of $4,000, which is $3,800.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
