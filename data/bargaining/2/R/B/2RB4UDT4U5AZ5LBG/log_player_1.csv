"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44
}
```

I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining money to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer from round 4. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the current value of the money."
