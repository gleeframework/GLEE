"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time. 60-40 in my favor seems fair, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as it's not a significant improvement from the initial proposal. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreased value of money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
