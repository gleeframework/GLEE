"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that's less favorable to me than the one I made in the first round. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is now even less favorable to me than my original offer, but the money is worth less for him due to inflation. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going to another round with a decreasing value of money."
