"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 5% less to Alice in each subsequent round. I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer and attach a message to justify it.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is now 55 for me and 45 for you.  This is the best I can do considering the money will be worth even less if you reject it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but 9.75% less to Alice, I can try to push my luck a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer. Maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise as the value of her potential gain decreases further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money to Alice. Since it's now worth 14.26% less to her than in the first round, I can try to be a bit more aggressive.

{""bob_gain"": 58,
""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I think this is a fair split. You should accept before the money loses even more value.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the best deal you'll get considering the inflation and the fact that I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end this now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I think I've pushed my luck far enough, and a 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, especially considering the decreasing value of the money to Alice.
