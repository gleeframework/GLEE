"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid any further rounds of negotiation. This leaves a large amount for myself while ensuring Bob gets a decent share, potentially encouraging him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I need to be realistic. The money is losing value quickly and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a significant amount for me, and continuing to reject offers risks ending with both of us getting nothing."
