"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split - 55% for me, 45% for you. Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice proposes next! I want a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I think a 52.5/47.5 split is fair considering the inflation, and it's a good starting point for a quick resolution.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still think the 55/45 split was more fair. Let's meet in the middle at 52/48. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take the deal now, since inflation will eat away at my gains even further."
