I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems like a good starting point, giving Bob a decent amount while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, 200,000 is far too little compared to the 900,000 I was initially hoping for. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 30/70 split this time.  Since we both lost some money due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit. This offer is still favorable to me but gives Bob a significantly larger share than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While it's significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money.  Getting 400,000 is better than getting nothing in the next round, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob."
