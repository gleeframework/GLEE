"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess if needed""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm open to negotiating further if Bob is not satisfied."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 400,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's share of 600,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not happy with the terms, but I'll consider it. I'd rather have a smaller share that's worth more in real terms than a larger share that's worth less due to inflation.

Round 3

I'm not thrilled with the terms, but I'll consider it. I'd rather have a smaller share that's worth more in real terms than a larger share that's worth less due to inflation.

However, I notice that this offer is similar to Bob's previous offer, and I'm starting to think that he might be trying to wear me down. I'll take a chance and try to negotiate further.

Round 7

I'm not thrilled with the terms, but I'll consider it. I've been trying to negotiate for a higher share, but Bob seems to be sticking to his guns.

However, I notice that this offer is still a bit better than my current share would be worth in real terms, considering the inflation. I'll take it, but I'm not happy about it.
