"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% of the initial $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
