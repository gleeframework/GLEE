"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40. It's a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's flip the script and I'll take the bigger share this time. This will be a good start, but I am open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob the larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd rather not give up too much more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60-40 split. Can we try something closer to 55-45?""
}
```

I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still keeping the conversation open for further negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less again, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try 42-58. It's a fair compromise, and we can work from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance between our gains."
