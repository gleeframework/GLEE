"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but I'll be fair""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I want to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, don't be greedy""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1%). I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 400,000 is a decent deal, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting a larger share. I think it's time to wrap up the game."
