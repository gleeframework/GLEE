"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, aiming to get the vast majority of the money.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm assuming Bob has no way to know how the inflation will affect him.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider his possible strategies in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the original value of the money, even with the inflation. Rejecting this offer means I'm taking a chance on getting a better offer in the future, but also a risk of getting nothing at all.  Given the limited rounds, it's safer to take the sure thing."
