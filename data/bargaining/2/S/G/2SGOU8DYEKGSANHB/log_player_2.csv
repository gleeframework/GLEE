"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a decent amount.""}

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
