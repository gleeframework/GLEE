"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'm not as eager to settle for a smaller share.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
