"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I would get $500,000, which is 50% of the original amount, and Bob would get $500,000, which is also 50% of the original amount, but worth 10% less due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
