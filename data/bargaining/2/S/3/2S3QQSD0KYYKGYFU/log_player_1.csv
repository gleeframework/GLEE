"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for me, and the inflation is working in my favor. It's still early in the game, so I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""How about this? I'm willing to be flexible, but the deal needs to be fair for me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:** Bob's value is decreasing faster than mine. I'm pushing for a better split while he's more motivated to settle.
* **Appearing Flexible:** I increased my initial offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a significant advantage. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're getting closer to the deadline, which adds pressure on Bob to accept a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob is inching closer to my initial offer, but it's still not favorable.  His offer is only slightly better than his Round 2 offer, even considering the inflation. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on my side. The longer the game goes, the more unattractive his offers become in real value to him.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk that Bob will become less rational and refuse to offer a decent deal, but I'm betting he'll want to avoid getting $0."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. This is a very reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Demand:** I'm nudging my offer up slightly, but maintaining a firm stance. It emphasizes the value I bring to the table, especially with the looming deadline.
* **Psychological Pressure:** The message highlights the dwindling time, urging Bob to make a decision that benefits him before it's too late.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming to secure a deal in this round or the next, maximizing my gains from Bob's increasingly desperate position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to consider the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:**  Bob's offer barely budged from his Round 4 offer, even though the value of his potential gain has significantly decreased due to inflation. This indicates he might be trying to stall and hoping I'll cave.
* **Maintaining Advantage:** I still hold a strong position. The longer we wait, the less appealing his offers become to him in real terms.  
* **Approaching Mid-Game:** We are approaching the middle of the negotiations. While I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds, I don't want to show weakness by accepting a subpar deal too soon."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Let's be realistic - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Negotiation:** It's time to establish a hardline stance.  I'm increasing my offer marginally to demonstrate some movement, but making it clear this is non-negotiable.
* **Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes the urgency, framing the decision as a simple ""take it or leave it"" choice. The shrinking timeframe works in my favor.
* **Strategic Calculation:** While I'm pushing for a larger share, I'm also offering Bob a reasonable amount to avoid him calling my bluff and risking the entire deal."
