"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is seemingly fair, the inflation factor heavily favors Bob in this scenario. By rejecting, Bob can potentially secure a better deal for himself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  It's a fair deal given the inflation rate is working against you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to 52/48. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is still working significantly in Bob's favor. By rejecting, Bob has another chance to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my previous proposal.  It's a fair deal given the inflation rate.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation, a 50/50 split seems fair at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, inflation is still heavily favoring Bob.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to reject."
