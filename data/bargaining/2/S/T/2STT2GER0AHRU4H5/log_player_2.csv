Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a more even split. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? This accounts for the inflation hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
