"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'll take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a measly $1. It's a risky strategy, but since the money inflates for me, I'll need to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's a better deal than getting nothing next round, and the inflation will likely make it much worse for me then."
