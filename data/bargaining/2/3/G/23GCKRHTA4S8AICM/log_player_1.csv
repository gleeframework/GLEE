"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of the initial amount, so I'd be getting $540,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
