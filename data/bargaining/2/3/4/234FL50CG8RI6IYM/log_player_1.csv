"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 9000/1000 in my favor. Since I'm the one making the offer in the first round, I'm going for a larger share. However, I'm also aware that you need to be incentivized to accept. Let's see what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm going to offer a slightly smaller share for Bob this round, reflecting the inflation and incentivizing him to accept.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm decreasing my offer slightly again, but I think this is still a reasonable split given the inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still rejecting Bob's offers. While the inflation is hurting, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a more equitable split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower split for me, but I think this is still a fair compromise given the inflation.  It's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

The inflation is starting to seriously bite, but I'm still holding out for a better offer. Bob seems to be taking advantage of my decreasing returns, and I won't accept that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm willing to make another concession, but time is running out.  I'm offering a split that gives Bob a significant share, hoping to convince him before we both lose out to inflation."
