"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie. Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully...

I decide to reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's previous offer was 70-30, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50-50, but still slightly favoring me due to the inflation effect.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect now significantly reducing the value of Bob's share, I'll think carefully about this offer...

I decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
