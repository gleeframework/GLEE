"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I'll also include a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting a 40% share rather than risking a bigger loss in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems more balanced, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to maximize my gain. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $420,000 and keep $580,000 for myself. I'll include a message saying ""Let's find a middle ground"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer. Since the money is losing value with each round, I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer rather than risking an even bigger loss in future rounds. I've adjusted my offer slightly from the initial one to show that I'm willing to compromise."
