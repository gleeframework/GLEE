"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split it evenly Alice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, I lose out due to inflation. Accepting this deal in Round 2 means I effectively get less than half the total value. I need to push for a deal that acknowledges the impact of inflation on my returns."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my share is losing value quickly. I need a slightly larger portion to make up for the inflation. This offer is still a good deal for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer acknowledges the inflation affecting your share, Alice, while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this offer from Bob is better than my current trajectory. Accepting a 52/48 split in Round 4 means I'm losing some value due to inflation, but it's better than risking further losses by continuing to negotiate. Bob seems unlikely to offer me a larger share, and the difference between this offer and a potentially worse deal in later rounds is too significant to ignore."
