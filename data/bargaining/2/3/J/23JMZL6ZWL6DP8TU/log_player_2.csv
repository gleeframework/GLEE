"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the same offer you just proposed, but with us receiving the opposite amounts. It seems you found this to be fair in round 2, so it should be fair now as well, even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
