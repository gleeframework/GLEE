# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I think I can do better than this. I'll let Bob know that I'm not accepting this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer a slightly more generous split than Bob's previous offer, hoping Bob will accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of my money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offers, I'm not thrilled about the 3000 I'd get, but I'm running out of options. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 3000 and hope that Bob will be more generous in the future rounds."
