"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, now it's your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount is 100 dollars. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to meet in the middle!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 50 / (0.9) = 55.56 (since my gain is worth 10% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 50 / (0.95) = 52.63 (since Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation)

With this in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather negotiate further to get a slightly higher amount, considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly lower amount, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a bit lower than the 50-50 split he suggested earlier. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being a bit too generous with the inflation discount, let's try to even it out 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to adjust the split to even it out.

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

My gain: 45 / (0.713) = 63.19 (since my gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 55 / (0.8586) = 63.83 (since Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation)

With this in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a 50-50 split, the inflation effect is still working in my favor, and I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority of the money, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of, let's see if you'll meet my offer""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 60 dollars, which is a higher amount than before, considering the inflation effect. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
