Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 30% than risk getting nothing in the next round. The inflation is hitting hard, and the game is unlikely to continue much longer."
