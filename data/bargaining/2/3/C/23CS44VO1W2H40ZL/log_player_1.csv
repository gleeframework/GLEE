Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll give you 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'll actually be getting less value than I offered Bob in the first round. I'll hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll offer Bob $360,000 and keep $640,000 for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's end this"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less in this round (48.8% less than the first round), I'll take what I can get. Bob's offer of $300,000 is better than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse deal. I'll take the sure thing and end the game here."
