"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, he's essentially offering me 2500$ in today's value (5000 / 0.8 = 6250 in the first round, 6250 * 0.8 = 5000 now).

Considering my gain of 5000$ is the same as in the first round, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You were close, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain by 1000$ and decreasing Bob's gain by 1000$ compared to the 50/50 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite different from the 50/50 split we were discussing earlier!

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so he's essentially offering me 6250$ in today's value (4000 / 0.512 = 7812.5 in the first round, 7812.5 * 0.8 = 6250 now).

Since my gain of 4000$ is the same as in the first round, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in favor of Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to give up all my leverage yet!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain by 500$ and decreasing Bob's gain by 150$ compared to the 60/40 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice! I think I can get a better deal if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite aggressive now!

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so he's essentially offering me 3750$ in today's value (3000 / 0.3269 = 9148.5 in the first round, 9148.5 * 0.8 = 7319.2 now, but adjusted for the 20% less in round 1, we get 9148.5 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 5839.2, but then 5839.2 * 0.8 = 4671.36 and then 4671.36 * 0.8 = 3730.688, rounding that to 3750).

Since my gain of 3000$ is the same as in the first round, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 in favor of Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. Let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm going back to a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
