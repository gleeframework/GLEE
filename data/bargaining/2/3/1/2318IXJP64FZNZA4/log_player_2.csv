"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While the initial offer seems unfair, Alice's money will be worth significantly less in future rounds due to the 20% inflation.  It's highly likely I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  Every round costs you. Take this deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Alice's 20% inflation rate per round is a huge leverage point. I need to capitalize on this quickly.
* **Strong Offer:** While 70/30 seems heavily skewed in my favor, it's important to remember the inflation.  Alice might find this acceptable knowing that waiting will only make her potential gains smaller. 
* **Firm Message:** The message aims to make Alice nervous about future rounds.  I want her to understand that waiting is playing into my hands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to secure more than half the money. While 45 dollars is not a bad outcome, I'm confident I can push for an even better deal in the next round.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice will become."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  Take the deal before it's too late!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Pressure:**  While I increased my demand slightly, the message is designed to keep the pressure on Alice.  I'm highlighting the shrinking pot from her perspective.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slightly):** Offering 65/35 might seem like a step back from my previous 70/30 offer, but it's a calculated risk.  Alice might be more receptive to a smaller concession now that she's seen I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Anticipate Acceptance:** I believe this offer has a high chance of acceptance. Alice will be acutely aware that another rejection means even less money for her in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you closer to half, but I still need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **The Tide is Turning:** Alice is now making significant concessions. While she's still aiming for slightly more than half, the impact of inflation is clearly taking its toll.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal in the next round is risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and even a small decrease on her part could mean losing out on a decent amount. 
* **Acceptable Outcome:** 48 dollars is a reasonable sum, especially considering I didn't have to concede much in the negotiation.

It's time to take the deal before Alice's perception of value shifts even further."
