"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, more for me""}\n\nSince the game just started, there's no history of offers or messages to consider. In this initial round, Alice makes an offer where she gets $6000 and Bob gets $4000, with a message suggesting a ""fair"" split but favoring herself slightly. The message is brief and attempts to set a tone for the negotiation, hinting that Alice believes she deserves a bit more but is willing to share a significant portion with Bob. The strategy here is to start with a position that is somewhat favorable to Alice but still within a realm that Bob might consider reasonable, aiming to either get an early acceptance or set the stage for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering inflation. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlice rejects Bob's offer because it gives Bob the larger share, and considering the inflation affects Bob's gains more significantly over time, Alice has an incentive to prolong the negotiations to see if she can get a better deal. The message from Bob tries to create a sense of urgency and fairness, but Alice recognizes the strategic implications of the inflation mechanic in the game and decides to hold out for a potentially better offer or to make a counteroffer that could sway the division in her favor. By rejecting, Alice maintains the option to propose a new division in the next round, hoping to exploit the increasing pressure of inflation on Bob's side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair for both""}\n\nAlice makes a new offer, slightly reducing her initial demand to show willingness to compromise but still favoring herself. The message acknowledges the inflation factor, suggesting that Alice is taking Bob's decreasing value into consideration, attempting to appear reasonable while still pushing for a larger share. This strategy aims to pressure Bob into accepting, as the inflation mechanic increasingly disadvantages him with each passing round. By adjusting her offer only slightly, Alice maintains a strong negotiating position while appearing to make concessions."
