Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 55% for me is a fair deal.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your side, I think 60% for me is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is acknowledging the inflation, his offer is getting worse for me. Accepting 400,000 now is the same as accepting even less than the previous round's offer. I need to push back firmly, as time is working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.  Every round costs us both money!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about ending this negotiation quickly and fairly.  It also highlights that his greed is costing us both potential gains.  He might accept, but if he continues to be unreasonable, I'll need to consider accepting a less favorable deal in the next round or two before the inflation eats away too much of my potential earnings."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the substantial impact of inflation on your side, I believe 70% for me is a fair reflection of the current situation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the relentless march of inflation makes it necessary.  While Bob is being incredibly unfair, rejecting this offer means risking even less in future rounds. Accepting 300,000 now, though much lower than I desired, is still better than potentially getting an even smaller amount later."
