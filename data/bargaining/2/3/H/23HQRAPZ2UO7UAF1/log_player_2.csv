**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split.  While her offers are slowly improving, the inflation rate means time is working against us more than it is her.  I'm hoping that rejecting this offer will make her realize the money is disappearing quickly and we need to settle soon."
