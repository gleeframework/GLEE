"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the amount of money on the table.

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000 / 0.9 = $5,555.56
* Bob gain: $5,000 / 0.9 = $5,555.56

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this split. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the amount of money.

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: $4,000 / 0.7279 = $5,498.55
* Bob gain: $6,000 / 0.7279 = $8,247.35

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure I want to reject it either. The inflation is making the numbers really tricky. I'll think about it for a moment...
