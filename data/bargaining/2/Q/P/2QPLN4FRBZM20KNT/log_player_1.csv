"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a bit more to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm taking a slightly larger share to get the negotiations started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no tricks! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I need to adjust my calculations accordingly.

Since my gain is worth 5% less, $60 is now equivalent to $57.30 in Round 2's value.
Bob's gain of $50 is worth 10% less, which is equivalent to $45 in Round 2's value.

Considering the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original proposal in Round 1.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
