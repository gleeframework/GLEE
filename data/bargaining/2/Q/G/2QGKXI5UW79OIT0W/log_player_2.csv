Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Think about the future value.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is indeed eating away at the value, but mostly for you. This is my most generous offer yet, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Regretfully, I'll accept your offer.

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a smaller amount now is better than risking even further losses due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
