"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's a mistake! You said the money I gain is worth 36% less, but I already knew that from the previous rounds. Now, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 36% less than in the first round is not correct.

However, I see that Alice's offer is the same as in Round 2. I already rejected that offer, so I'll reject it again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
