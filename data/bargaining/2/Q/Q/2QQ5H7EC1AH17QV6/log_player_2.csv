"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair deal, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, I'll be taking the bigger share as the proposer but you'll get a decent cut. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 100,000 is a decent amount, it's worth holding out for a better deal.  The inflation will hurt Alice more than me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Alice. We both get a good amount, and we avoid the risk of further inflation.""}
