"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000 and keep $8000. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000 and keeping $8000, which is a 20% share for him and 80% for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the loss of value in each round, let's aim for an equal division to avoid inflation's impact. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at a different rate for each of us, an equal division makes sense.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
