"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and consider the depreciation. This is a more balanced split.""}\n\nI've taken into account the depreciation of the money for both of us and tried to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. Waiting for Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation impact. Let's split the money evenly this time. It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our gains, an even split seems like a reasonable and fair solution at this point. It's better to accept this offer rather than risking further depreciation in subsequent rounds."
