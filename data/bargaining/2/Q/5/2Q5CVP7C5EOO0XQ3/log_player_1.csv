"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but still a fair share, to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since Bob's offer is still a decent chunk, but not as high as I initially proposed, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a larger share to Bob, but still keep a significant amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise and give him a larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting desperate yet, but I'll give you a slightly bigger share. Don't expect too much more from me. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a significant toll on Bob's offer, I'll have to be cautious. However, considering the offer is still a decent one, I'll decide to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will keep his word and not expect too much more from me in the future!"
