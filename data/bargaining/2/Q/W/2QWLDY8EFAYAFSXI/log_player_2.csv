Round 2

""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 60%, and you get 40%. This accounts for inflation, and gives us both a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor considering the inflation rate hurting me more than her.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering inflation. We both lose more the longer we wait. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is fair at this point. The inflation is eating into the total value, and we are past the halfway point. Accepting now guarantees I get something substantial."
