This is a very simple strategy. I'm offering Bob the smallest possible amount, hoping he'll take it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round. It's a high-risk, high-reward move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the money is worth less for me, accepting a 50/50 split is still better than risking getting nothing in the next round. The inflation penalty is significant, but I'd rather take the sure thing."
