"Round 1
Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, but 80/20 is my final offer. Remember, with each round, the money loses value faster for you than for me.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use intimidation tactics, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  Let's be practical and end this before inflation eats away at the pot."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm coming down to 70/30.  We both know the longer we wait, the less we both get.  This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is finally moving towards a more reasonable split, and the time pressure is becoming a significant factor. Accepting 30% now is better than risking getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing, in later rounds."
