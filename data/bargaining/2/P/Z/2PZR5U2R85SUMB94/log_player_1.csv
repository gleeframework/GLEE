"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a bigger share. I'll wait for a better offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a more balanced split."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to budge a bit more, but 575/425 is a final offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to keep going back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and this offer is a slight adjustment towards Bob's direction."
