Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our profits. I'm being realistic, this offer still gives you a considerable sum. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly with the decreasing value of her potential gains. While her offer is better than her first, it's still skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble another round to see if I can secure a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure. Let's close the deal and walk away with a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice's offer is now closer to my previous one, signaling she's feeling the pressure. However, she's still aiming for the larger share.  Given the accelerating inflation, I need to hold my ground a little longer in hopes of securing a more favorable split in the next round or two.  The risk is growing though, and I might have to accept a less appealing offer soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, slightly favoring me to reflect the inflation disparity. Let's be smart and take it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is really on now.  Alice is starting to understand that holding out too long will hurt her more. This offer is my best shot at getting a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for her to accept, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer - it's more than fair considering the time left and the impact of inflation on both of us! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful to accept less than what I aimed for, but Alice is right. This is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is eating away at the money quickly, and while her offer still favors her, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Continuing to hold out risks a worse outcome, potentially ending up with nothing."
