Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  Rejecting it risks getting nothing at all in the end, as the inflation will only worsen."
