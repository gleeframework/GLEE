"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving up too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, I don't want to give up too much to Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. I'll propose a higher share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need more to keep up with inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of me! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my share! Considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair offer considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise given the circumstances.
