"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, it's effectively $9,500. I'll make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me. 

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money for me, I need to be more cautious. However, this offer is still relatively close to the initial offer I made, and it's not a bad deal considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept this offer.
