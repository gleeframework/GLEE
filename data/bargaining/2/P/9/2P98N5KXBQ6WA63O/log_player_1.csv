"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
