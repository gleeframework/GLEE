"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you don't like this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can consider this a starting point for further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less than the original $5000, so I'll get $4000 in this round. Bob's gain is worth 5% less than his original $5000, so he'll get $5700.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 7000 is a fair amount considering the inflation. You can try to do better if you want. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 48.8% less than the original $5000, so I'll get $2600 in this round. Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than his original $5000, so he'll get $6430.

Considering this, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than a 75/25 split, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 48.8% less than the previous round, so I'll get $1360 in this round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1360,
  ""bob_gain"": 8640,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I think I'll have to accept a smaller share if we don't meet soon. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the situation and willing to accept a smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount."
