"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate from there. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to negotiate for a better split. 60/40 seems a bit too much in Alice's favor. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. A 55/45 split seems more reasonable to me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This inflation is getting serious! A 50/50 split seems like the fairest way to go now. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nA 50/50 split seems like a great compromise, especially considering the inflation. I'm happy to accept this offer and end the game here."
