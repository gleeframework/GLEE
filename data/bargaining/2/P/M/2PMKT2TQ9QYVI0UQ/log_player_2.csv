"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's a good starting point, but I can probably get more.  Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 200000, ""alice_gain"": 800000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to take a bit less, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'll lower my share a bit, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like more, this is a fair compromise given the inflation and the fact it's her final offer."
