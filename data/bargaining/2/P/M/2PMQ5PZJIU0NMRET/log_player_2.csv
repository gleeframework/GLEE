"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get 90% and you get 10%.  I believe this is a good start and we can negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With a 20% decrease in value for me and only a 5% decrease for Alice, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation rates, I believe 40% for me and 60% for you is a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation rates and decided to make an offer that is more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Alice. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and only 5% less for Alice, I believe I should get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer!"
