"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself the larger share.  This seems like a good starting point, as I have the advantage of the higher inflation rate.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair.  While I lose value in the deal, Bob gets a much higher percentage, and I'm still left with a small amount. I'll reject this offer and hope for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing that I'm still at a disadvantage due to inflation. This offers Bob a fair increase in his share compared to the last round, and hopefully, we can find a more agreeable outcome."
