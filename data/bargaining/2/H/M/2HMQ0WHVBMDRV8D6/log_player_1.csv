"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this case, I'm considering the effective gain for me in terms of the original $100. The offer is that I get $20, which is worth 70% of the original $70 I proposed in Round 1. Considering the inflation, this is a relatively good deal for me.

I'll accept this offer.
