Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth $500,000, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, which is $450,000.

I'm not convinced that 60/40 is a fairer split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
