"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you'll take $4,000. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I'm hoping for a slightly better deal.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time.  We can end this quickly and avoid any further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up 60% of the total amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to give up more than 45% of the total. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""
}
