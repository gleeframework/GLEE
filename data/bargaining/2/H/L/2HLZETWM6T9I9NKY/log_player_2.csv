"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly skewed offer. I'll take 999k, and you get 1k.  Hopefully, we can work our way to a better split for you later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! I'm sure we can do better. ðŸ˜„"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. How about a 70/30 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 60/40 split this time.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a better share than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

That's still not a great deal for me. Alice is feeling the inflation pressure, so let's see if she's willing to make a better offer next round."
