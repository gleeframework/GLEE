"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to push for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55 is still a bit too much.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 58-42 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's slightly better than the previous offers. I'll just have to hope that Bob will be more generous in the future.
