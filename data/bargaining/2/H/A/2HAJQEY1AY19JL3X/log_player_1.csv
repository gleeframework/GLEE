"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. It's not a significant enough adjustment to account for the inflation disparity.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round. Let's see if you accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself, trying to account for the inflation disparity."
