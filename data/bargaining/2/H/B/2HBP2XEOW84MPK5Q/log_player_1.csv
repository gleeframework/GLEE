"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate.

I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
