"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $90 and Bob getting $10. I believe this is a fair offer considering I'm the one making the proposal and the money is worth less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to accept Bob's offer.  Since the money is worth less to me in each round, I'm better off taking the 50/50 split now."
