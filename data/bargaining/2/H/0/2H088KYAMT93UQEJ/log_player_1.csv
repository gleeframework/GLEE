"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'd rather not accept a 40-60 split. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm offering a slightly skewed split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
