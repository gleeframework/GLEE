"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,

I'm willing to give Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly. 5500 for me, 4500 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,

I've reduced my share slightly, hoping Bob will see it as a compromise and accept the offer before the money loses more value due to inflation!"
