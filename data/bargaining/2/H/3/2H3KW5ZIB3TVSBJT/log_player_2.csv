Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, the actual amounts I'll receive are:

* 45 * 0.64 (80% of 100%) = 28.8
* 55 * 0.81 (81% of 100%) = 44.55

I'll accept Alice's offer.
