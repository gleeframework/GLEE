  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a good starting point for negotiations 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my strategy. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my part in this negotiation.""

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher share, but still be mindful of the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a very small share, but I think I deserve the majority considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very cautious. With Bob's offer, I'll be left with a relatively small share, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
