"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to get this money quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me, Alice. How about we try a 55/45 split instead?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your preference for a 55/45 split, Bob. However, considering the time value of money and the fact that it's depreciating for me, I propose we reverse the amounts from your last offer.  This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is now better for me than it will be if I wait another round.
