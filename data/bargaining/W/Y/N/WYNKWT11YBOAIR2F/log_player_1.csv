Let's start with a fair split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. I'll take my chances with inflation and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll try to increase my share a little bit. It's risky, but I think I can get a better deal than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than the original 50/50 split, it's still better than nothing. However, I'm going to stick to my guns and try to get a better deal in the next round. Inflation is a factor, but I'm hoping to secure a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm pushing my luck here, but Bob's last offer was significantly lower, and I believe I can secure a better deal for myself this time around. It's a gamble, but I'm feeling confident."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful to see the value of my share drop so dramatically, but at this point, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The risk of getting nothing at all is too high, and I need to secure at least some portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob understands the impact of inflation on his gains as well."
