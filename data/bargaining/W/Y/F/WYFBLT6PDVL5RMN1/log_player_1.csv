I'm going for a high initial offer, aiming for a quick resolution. 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a low offer, especially since the money is now worth less. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for inflation, but still aiming for a large portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to accept now than risk getting even less in the next round."
