"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob takes 40%, which is $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 4:1 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4:1 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is a proposal for a 4:1 split, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: $2000
* Bob gain: $8000

Considering the inflation effect, I'll take into account that my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll multiply my gain by 0.8:

$2000 * 0.8 = $1600

And Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll multiply his gain by 0.9:

$8000 * 0.9 = $7200

With this calculation, I can see that Bob's gain is still much higher than mine. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 45-55 split""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I take 45% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,500, and Bob takes 55%, which is $5,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more balanced than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, let's try a 3:1 split 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

* Alice gain: $2500
* Bob gain: $7500

Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll multiply my gain by 0.516 (1 - 0.488):

$2500 * 0.516 = $1288

And Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll multiply his gain by 0.729 (1 - 0.271):

$7500 * 0.729 = $5475

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'll accept it since it's a slightly better deal than the previous ones.
