Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split. I'm proposing 95 for myself and 5 for you.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
