"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more even split. Let's keep things fair, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.  This is a much better deal than the last one, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
