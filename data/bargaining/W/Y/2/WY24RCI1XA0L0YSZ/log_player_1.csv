"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer gives me almost all the money, leaving Bob with only $1. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my share, and this offer is the most favorable to me in the first round.  

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, this offer is a fair split and the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money."
