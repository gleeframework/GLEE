"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves a small amount for Bob. It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get at least half of the available funds."
