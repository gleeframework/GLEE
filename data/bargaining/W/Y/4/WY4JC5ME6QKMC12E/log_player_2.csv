Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll offer a slightly more generous split to try to get her to accept.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so I'll need to adjust my expectations. However, Alice's offer is still a 45/55 split, which is relatively close to the initial offer. I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll also consider the fact that the money is worth less.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less than the original, I'll aim for a slightly more skewed split to compensate for the reduced value. I'll offer a 48/52 split.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and Alice is offering a 50/50 split. This is a relatively fair offer considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
