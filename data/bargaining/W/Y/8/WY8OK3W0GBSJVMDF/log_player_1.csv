"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for round 3 will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, with a 40-60 split."
