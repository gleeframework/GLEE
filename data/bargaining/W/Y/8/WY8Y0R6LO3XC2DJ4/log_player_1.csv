"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the 100$ and Bob gets 30%. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but let's be efficient. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll consider the effective amounts. 

For me, the effective Alice gain is 45 * 0.8 = 36. 

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than 36$."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since the money is worth 80% of the previous round's value, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no need to fight for more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
