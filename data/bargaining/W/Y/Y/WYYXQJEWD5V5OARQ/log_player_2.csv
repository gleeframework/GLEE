"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 90/10 split, with me taking the larger share. This is a good start to our negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 90/10 split might seem generous, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split, which is fairer than the last offer.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but 60/40 is a reasonable split considering the inflation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something. With each round, the inflation will continue to eat away at our potential gains."
