Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous with Bob.  I want to secure a deal quickly, and hopefully, Bob will accept.  This way, we both get a good amount before the money loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split and the money is rapidly losing value. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a good portion of the money."
