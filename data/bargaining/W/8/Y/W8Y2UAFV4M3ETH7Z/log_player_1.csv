"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small amount to start with, to see if he'll accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me a fair split, but I'm hoping for more. I'll give you a chance to reconsider. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I want to give him 80 dollars.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the aggressive offer from Bob in Round 2, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to find a deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite, my gain is worth significantly less now. Bob's offer to meet in the middle seems reasonable, considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
