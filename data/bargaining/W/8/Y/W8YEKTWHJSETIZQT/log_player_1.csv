"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight lean towards me, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 60/40 split, but I understand Bob's offer is still a slight lean towards me.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slightly more favorable ratio for me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offers, I'm not thrilled with the 48/52 split, but I'm willing to accept it. The message from Bob suggests he's not willing to give up much more, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer and end the game."
