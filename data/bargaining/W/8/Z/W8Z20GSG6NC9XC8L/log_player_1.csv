"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 990,000$ and give Bob 10,000$. This way, I maximize my gain while still giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept the offer. Even though I'm getting half, it's still a significant amount and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future, especially considering Bob's money is worth less with each passing round."
