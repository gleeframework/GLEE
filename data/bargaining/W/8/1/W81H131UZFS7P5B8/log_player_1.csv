Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very unfair offer. This way, I can maximize my potential gain if Bob rejects it and we get to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. It's just as unfair as mine, and I know I can do better. We still have a lot of rounds left!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

This is a fair offer. I want to make sure we both get a good amount of money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further rounds."
