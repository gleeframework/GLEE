"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round for me, and I need to be more cautious.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to protect my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the reduced value of the money for me, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, Bob is offering me a smaller share, which might be a better option given the current circumstances.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
