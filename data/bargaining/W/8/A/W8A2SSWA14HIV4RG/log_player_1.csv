"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, ensuring a good return for both of us. We can work out a better deal in the next round if this isn't to your liking. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
