Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I'm not willing to give away too much. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
