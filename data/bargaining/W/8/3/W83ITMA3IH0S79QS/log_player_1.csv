"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nSince it's the first round, I'll start with a relatively even split, slightly favoring myself to account for the potential future rounds and the impact of inflation. The message ""Let's be fair"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer early on, minimizing the loss due to inflation for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. Let's not lose more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, Bob's offer of 45 for me and 55 for himself doesn't seem as appealing, especially considering the devaluation of the money. In the next round, I aim to propose a division that takes into account the growing devaluation, potentially leveraging the greater loss Bob faces due to inflation to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the next round's loss""}\n\nIn this round, I've slightly adjusted my initial offer to reflect the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us, but particularly on Bob. The message ""Consider the next round's loss"" is meant to remind Bob that waiting further will only decrease the value of the money more significantly for him than for me, encouraging him to accept this offer rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, a 50/50 split seems reasonable. The loss due to inflation is substantial, and accepting this offer ensures that I receive a known quantity now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Bob's message emphasizing a fair split and the urgency due to inflation aligns with my own concerns, making acceptance the most prudent decision."
