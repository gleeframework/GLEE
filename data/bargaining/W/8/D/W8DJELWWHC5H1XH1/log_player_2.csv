Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. My last offer was generous, this one is fair. Take it or I'll be forced to be more aggressive. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly impatient, and her offers are reflecting that. While her offer isn't terrible, it's clear the momentum is shifting in Bob's favor as the rounds progress.  Alice's gains are losing value quickly, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal soon."

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it before inflation eats away at this deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is now a reasonable outcome for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Alice is feeling the heat. Her potential gains have eroded significantly, making her more open to a deal previously unacceptable. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the pressure increases. While Bob is holding steady, Alice risks getting nothing if the rounds run out. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and her offers could get worse out of desperation in later rounds.

A 50/50 split guarantees Bob a significant sum and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
