"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the lion's share, but I'll give you a decent chunk too.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. We both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the value of the money in terms of the initial $10,000. In this case, my gain of $4000 is equivalent to 40% of the initial $10,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation, but I'll accept it for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
