Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to give up that much. This offer is still fair, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  While Alice's offer is better than her first, we are approaching the halfway point of the rounds. The longer the game goes, the more value we both lose.
* **Shift in Power:** Alice seems quite insistent on a larger share. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about negotiating and not just accepting a lowball offer. 
* **Future Offers:** Alice's offers have been steadily decreasing in her favor. By rejecting this, we might be able to push her closer to a 50/50 split (or at least something more beneficial) in the next round. 

It's a gamble, but the potential for a better outcome in the next few rounds is worth the risk."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer is a compromise to avoid both of us losing out. Let's close the deal and get our money!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** We've passed the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. We need to emphasize the urgency to Alice.
* **Compromise:** We've lowered our demand slightly from the previous round (650k to 550k) to show flexibility and encourage Alice to accept.
* **Direct Language:**  ""Let's close the deal"" is a call to action, aiming to push Alice toward a decision. 

This offer balances our desire for a larger share with the reality of the shrinking pot and the limited time remaining."
