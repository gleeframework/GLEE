"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While a million dollars is a lot to lose over time, I'm not going to accept a deal where I get practically nothing. I'm confident I can negotiate something much better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 850000,
""alice_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer starting point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go any lower. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing tough, but that's still a bad deal for me, especially with inflation eating into my potential winnings. I need to push for more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, 
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. I'm willing to be generous, but I need you to meet me halfway. Time is running out.""}"
