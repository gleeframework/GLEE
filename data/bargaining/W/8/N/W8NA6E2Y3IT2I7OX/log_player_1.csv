"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
