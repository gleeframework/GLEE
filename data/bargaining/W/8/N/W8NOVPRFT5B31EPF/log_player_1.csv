Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's essentially offering me 66.67 (50 / 0.75) and himself 50. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 40% less for Bob now (20% less than the previous round), I'll offer him a smaller share.
