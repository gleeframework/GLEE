"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very generous offer to Bob in the first round, leaving him with a small amount but still giving him something. This sets the stage for future negotiations and hopefully encourages Bob to accept the deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my offer in the previous round, and it's still a large amount for me. However, I'm going to reject it. I want to see if Bob is willing to be more flexible in his negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than his previous offer, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping this demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to be completely taken advantage of."
