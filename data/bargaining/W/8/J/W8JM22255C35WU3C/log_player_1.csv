"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly. I'm also mindful that with each round, the value of money decreases for him, so I'm trying to incentivize him to take the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and while the value of the money is decreasing for Bob, it's still a very lopsided deal.  I'm going to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a decent split. I think Bob will be more inclined to accept since he lost some money due to inflation in the previous round.  This way we can both get something and avoid the risk of losing everything later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. Even though the value of his money is decreasing, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to try and find a middle ground. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, so I need to find a way to convince Bob to accept.  I'm hoping that offering a more balanced split will be enough to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly ridiculous. I won't accept such a tiny share, even with the decreasing value of the money for him. I'm still holding out hope for a more reasonable deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm offering an even split.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that continuing to reject offers could lead to both of us getting nothing. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, and hopefully, he'll accept."
