Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be more realistic. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is as low as I can go.  The inflation is hurting us both, but it's hitting you harder.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely affecting my returns with each passing round.  Delaying further significantly erodes the value of my potential gain.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer is only slightly better than my previous one, waiting for a significantly better offer in later rounds is risky. The longer the game continues, the less attractive any potential offer becomes due to inflation. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a less than ideal but still reasonable payout. Rejecting  risks further losses and the possibility of an even lower offer from Bob in desperation as the value diminishes for both of us. 
 
It's important to cut losses at a certain point, and Round 4 seems to be that point."
