"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand time is a factor, Alice. How about we meet a bit closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""It seems like we both want a deal, Bob. This is a slight adjustment to my previous offer, considering the time constraint.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest I can offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation is heavily working in my favor. Bob's share is decreasing significantly each round, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal later on."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, a 50/50 split sounds fair in a vacuum, but the clock is ticking. I'm giving you a chance to secure a reasonable amount. Let's be realistic.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm sticking to my previous offer.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's clinging to the idea of a 50/50 split that's quickly becoming unrealistic. I need to hold firm for now, but I should be prepared to make a slightly more appealing offer soon to avoid risking everything."
