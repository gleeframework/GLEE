"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more but you still get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal that gives Alice a 60/40 split right off the bat. We have 12 rounds, and the money inflates against me, so I'll need to be more strategic. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's start with a 55/45 split. What do you think?"" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's try this split. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a split that's heavily in her favor. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation is working against me and I need to push for a better deal.  I'll keep rejecting until we get closer to a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""We're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. This is a fair offer for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know we're running out of time, but I still think I can get a bit more. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair, and the inflation is really hurting me now. I'm not going to accept anything less than a 50/50 split. I'll continue to push for a fair deal, even though we're running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""This is our last chance to get something. Let's split the money evenly. We both lose if we keep rejecting each other's offers.""
