"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000/6000 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too skewed in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the split, still a fair deal!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than the initial 50/50 split, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's end! I'm not thrilled about the 3500/6500 split, but I'll consider it. Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too skewed in his favor again, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Back to a 50/50 split, let's make it happen!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split again, hoping that Bob will see the value in a fair and equal division. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
