"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of the money decreasing by 10% each round, I'd like to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is still too skewed in your favor. I'll make a new offer: 500k for me, 500k for you. It's a 50/50 split, but I think it's the fairest considering the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 55.5/44.5 is a more reasonable split. I'll take 550k, and you'll get 450k. What do you think?""
}
