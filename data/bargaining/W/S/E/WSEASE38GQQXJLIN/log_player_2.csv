"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. This is a fair offer that benefits us both, and avoids further risk of inflation. Let's finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation in her favor. While 300,000 is a significant sum, accepting this offer still leaves me with significantly less than half the pot.  We're only in round 3, and I'm willing to bet Alice will become more amenable to a fairer split as the rounds progress and the impact of inflation grows."
