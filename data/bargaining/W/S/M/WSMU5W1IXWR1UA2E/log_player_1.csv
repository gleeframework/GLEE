"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the effect of inflation on Bob's offer.

Since Bob's offer is 700,000, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation, it's equivalent to 630,000 in the first round. However, my gain of 300,000 is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal. Here's my response:

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
