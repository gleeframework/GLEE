Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 75/25 split in my favor, reflecting the value I bring to the table.  This is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation in the coming rounds. Let's end this game amicably. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{
