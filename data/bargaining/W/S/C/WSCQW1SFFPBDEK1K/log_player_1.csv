"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. Since the money loses value over rounds, especially for Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both lose money with each round. Let's finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the decreasing value of money, I believe I can negotiate a better split. Since Bob's money loses value faster than mine, he has more incentive to settle quickly, which gives me leverage to push for a more favorable division. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, acknowledging the devaluation of money for both of us, but still aiming to benefit from Bob's greater urgency due to his higher rate of loss. This offer aims to appear reasonable while still favoring me."
