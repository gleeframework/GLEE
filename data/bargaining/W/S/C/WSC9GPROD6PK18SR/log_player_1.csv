"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a very slightly unequal split in my favor. I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer and whether he's willing to accept it, or if he's going to try to push for a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, I'm not willing to risk getting nothing. 500,000 is still a significant amount of money, and with the looming threat of inflation, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
