# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offers are getting worse for me despite the inflation he's facing. I need to hold firm and encourage him to make a more reasonable offer before the diminishing value significantly impacts a potential deal."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate and trying to take advantage of the situation.  While time pressure is mounting, accepting an offer worse than my initial proposal sets a bad precedent. I'll hold firm for now and see if he becomes more reasonable."
