"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $1000, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a relatively equal split and revisit later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my effective gain would be $6000 * 0.95 = $5700.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal later on.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3000 and keeping $7000 for myself, trying to find a balance between giving him a decent share and holding onto a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my effective gain would be $5000 * 0.857 (1 - 0.1426) = $4286.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer. It seems like we're finally meeting in the middle, and I don't want to risk going to another round.
