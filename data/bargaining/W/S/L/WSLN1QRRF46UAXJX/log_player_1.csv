"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and square split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my potential gain is now worth less, so I'll consider Bob's offer more carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
