"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

After calculating the adjusted amounts, I get:

My gain would be 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000 (since it's 20% less than the original 300,000)
Bob's gain would be 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000 (since it's 10% less than the original 700,000)

Considering the adjusted amounts, I'll accept Bob's offer.
