"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original amount, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair and equal split, no need to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 720000 (900000 * 0.8)
Bob gain: 80000 (100000 * 0.8)

Considering Bob's offer in round 2, I get 500000, which is more than what I would get in this round (720000). I'll accept the offer.
