"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less this round, my gain of 40 is actually 32 in real value.

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, my gain of 40 is actually 16 in real value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of the money, but I'm not going to get left with nothing!""
}
```

I'm trying to be generous, but still get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 20 is actually 10.4 in real value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal next round. I'll accept this offer to avoid going into the red.
