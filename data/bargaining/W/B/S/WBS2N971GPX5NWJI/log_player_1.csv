"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 in this round is worth $4000 (80% of $5000).

Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low for me, I'm hoping for a better offer next round.""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 64% of the previous round's gain, so it's worth $2560 (64% of $4000).

Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I think this is a fair compromise.  Let's end this game and split the money! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain has decreased significantly due to inflation. In this round, my gain of $4000 is worth $1600 (48.8% of $3280, which is 80% of $4000).

Considering Bob's offer, I think I should take it. I don't want to risk going into further rounds with a decreasing gain value.

Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, let's end it here. I'll take the $1600.""
}"
