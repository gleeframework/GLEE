"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better deal last round, I'm trying to make it more even this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more even, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make me accept. I'll have to think about it...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more!""
}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting hard!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a pretty tough pill to swallow. The money I'd get is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm not getting a good share of the remaining amount.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve the majority!""

Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and I'm getting desperate!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a decent attempt at finding a middle ground, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make me accept. The money I'd get is worth a lot less than in the first round, and I'm not sure if it's worth settling for.
