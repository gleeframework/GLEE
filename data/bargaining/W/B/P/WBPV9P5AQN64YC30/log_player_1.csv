"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, knowing that inflation might favor me in later rounds.  But I'm leaving a decent amount for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer.  I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round, but I'm willing to risk it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going back to my original offer.  Bob's offer was worse for me, and I'm hoping he'll realize that I'm not going to budge much from my original position. I'm willing to risk another round, but I'm not going to give up much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8500 
# Bob gain: 1500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Bob's offer is slightly worse than my last offer, but the inflation is starting to hurt him more than me, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
