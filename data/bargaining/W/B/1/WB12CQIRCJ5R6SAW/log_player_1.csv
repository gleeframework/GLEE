"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with only $1.  This is a very aggressive move, but it sets the stage for future negotiations. If Bob rejects, the pressure will be on him to propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a fair and reasonable offer from Bob. Accepting guarantees me half the money, which is a lot better than risking getting nothing if we continue to negotiate."
