I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not enough for me. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to give me a fair share.""

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! Bob's offer is now worth a fraction of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, considering the value of the money has decreased so significantly.

However, I'm getting a bit desperate too, and the prospect of ending up with nothing is becoming more likely. I'll think carefully about this one...

After considering the situation, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, we'll split it 50/50. I'm just glad we can finally end this game.""
