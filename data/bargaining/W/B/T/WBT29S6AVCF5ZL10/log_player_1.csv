"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It's still a good ratio, but it gives us both a bit more of the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
