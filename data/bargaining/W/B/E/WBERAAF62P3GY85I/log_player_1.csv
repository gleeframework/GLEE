"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince Bob is offering an even split, which seems fair, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable proposal, and there's no guarantee I could get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting ensures I get at least half of the total amount."
