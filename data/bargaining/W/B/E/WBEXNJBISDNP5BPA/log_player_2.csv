"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and the money is losing value for me rapidly.  This is my compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering to ""meet in the middle,"" the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Accepting $440,000 now is a bad deal compared to what it was worth in Round 1, and it will be even worse in future rounds. I need to push for a more favorable split quickly before the inflation eats away at my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this quickly.  My position is eroding fast. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, considering the inflation is hurting you, not me. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but with only 5 rounds left, the inflation is becoming critical.  Accepting $460,000 now is far from ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing if Alice continues to play hardball.  The difference between her offer and my last is relatively small at this stage, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
