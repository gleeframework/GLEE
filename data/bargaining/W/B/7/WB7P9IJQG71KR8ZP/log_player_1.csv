"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a fair share, and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 40% for Alice and 60% for Bob, and the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer a bit less to Bob to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation rate is now 27.1% for Bob, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the inflation rate is increasing, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of Bob's share. I'll offer a bit more to Bob to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
