Let's split the money evenly. Seems fair to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I'm going to offer Bob slightly more than he offered me in the previous round, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  While the money is worth less for me, it's still better than a further round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a lot of the value of my money, I don't think I can get a better deal at this point. Better to accept before the value drops even further!"
