I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave 100,000 dollars for Bob.  This ensures I get the majority of the money, but also gives Bob something to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob 200,000 dollars.  Since he rejected my first offer and made a counter offer that was unfavorable, I'm going to lower his share even further.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in taking something rather than risking getting nothing."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share this round, hoping to incentivize him to accept. Inflation is working against us both, so we need to reach an agreement soon."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

``` 
While Bob is offering a larger share than in previous rounds, the inflation rate is severely decreasing the value of the money I'm receiving.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob again, hoping to finally reach an agreement. Inflation is a serious threat, and we need to find a solution before it eats away at our potential gains.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this offer gives him a good share, and that rejecting it could lead to both of us losing even more money."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Although the inflation rate is significant, I believe I can still get a better deal.  He seems to be increasing his share each round, so I'm hoping I can convince him to accept a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this round.  Inflation is a significant factor now, and I'm starting to worry that we might both end up with nothing if we don't come to an agreement.  I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the urgency of the situation and accepts this offer."
