"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better for me, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the whole farm!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent offer and keeping some of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to reevaluate this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. It seems like Bob is making a bit of a concession, and I'm getting a slightly better deal than before."
