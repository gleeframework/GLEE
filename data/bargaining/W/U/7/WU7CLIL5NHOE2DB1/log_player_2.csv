"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, Bob should reject it. He has more time to wait and can benefit from Alice's higher inflation rate.  By rejecting, he can force Alice to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I believe this offer is more fair, considering the higher inflation rate you face.  Let's end this quickly."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting, Bob, but still not fair to me. Let's settle this now with a more balanced proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer.  While his gain is less than his previous proposal, it's still more than his initial offer, and Alice's inflation is hitting her harder. It's a good compromise to end the game."
