"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. This should hopefully incentivize him to accept, but also leaves me with a significant portion.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much worse for me than the first round. While the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, it's not a significant enough decrease to justify accepting such a low offer.  I'll reject this offer and hope to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, aiming for a more balanced split. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair offer and accept it, rather than risking further inflation impacting both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfavorable, even with the increased inflation impacting his gain more than mine. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate something better in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly again.  Given the continued inflation, it's likely Bob will be more willing to accept a more balanced split this round. Let's see if this works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better than the previous one, and the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me now. It's a good compromise. I'll take it!"
