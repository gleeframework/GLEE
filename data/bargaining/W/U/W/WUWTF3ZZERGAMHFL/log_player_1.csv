"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, and I'll take the remaining $750,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, $800,000 is now worth less than $750,000 in the first round, so I'm not as eager to accept this offer as I was before.

However, it's still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even lower values.

I'll accept this offer.
