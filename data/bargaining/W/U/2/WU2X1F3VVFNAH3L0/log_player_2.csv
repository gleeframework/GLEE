It's the first round, so there's a chance to get a better deal. While seemingly fair, Alice gains significantly more in this proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""My turn to propose a fairer deal, considering the inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now barely better than my previous one, and with inflation, waiting longer will only result in a smaller reward even if I could secure a slightly better split."
