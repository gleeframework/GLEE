"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident Bob will recognize the value in accepting this offer.  It's a good deal for both of us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 600,000 - 400,000 split.  Bob's last offer was unreasonable, and I believe this is a fair compromise.  It's important to remember that the money is losing value with each round.  Let's agree on this and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offers are getting worse with each round. It's time to stand my ground and fight for a better split.  The next offer is mine!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split.  We've both been stubborn so far, and the money is losing value rapidly.  Let's be reasonable and end this game."
