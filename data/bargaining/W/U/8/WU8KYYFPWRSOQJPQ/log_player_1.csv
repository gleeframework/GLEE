I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a much smaller share, it's better to accept this offer than risk another round of inflation. My share will be worth even less if I reject this."
