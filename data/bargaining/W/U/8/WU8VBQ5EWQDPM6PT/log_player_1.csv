"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the majority, but still giving Bob something. I'm hoping he'll accept, as we both get something right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have kept more for myself, the inflation is making this a risky game.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least $6,000, which is better than risking getting even less in a later round."
