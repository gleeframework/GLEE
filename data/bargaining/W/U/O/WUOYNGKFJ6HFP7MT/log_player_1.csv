"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 6,000 and leaving 4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. However, Bob is offering a more equal split, which might be a good opportunity to get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
