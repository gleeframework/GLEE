"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, leaving you with 40%. It's a better deal for me, but still a fair share considering the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a larger share of the money, and I don't think it's a fair deal. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still not giving up too much. Let's see if you'll take it.""}

I'm proposing that I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000. I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still holding onto a decent chunk of the money."
