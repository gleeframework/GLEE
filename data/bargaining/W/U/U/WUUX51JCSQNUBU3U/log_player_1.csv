"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to make a decision based on the relative values.

My initial offer was a 60-40 split, which is a good deal for me. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a better deal for him. However, considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
