"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual value of the money I'll get if I accept this offer. The actual value of the 5000 I'll get is 90% of the original 5000, which is 4500.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer this time. I'll take the 4500 and hope to do better in future rounds.
