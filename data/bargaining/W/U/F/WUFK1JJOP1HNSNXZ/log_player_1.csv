"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal than 10% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of 900,000, which is 810,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good deal for me. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
