"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value much faster for Alice than for Bob. 
* **Alice's position:**  Alice's potential gains are shrinking dramatically with each round.
* **Bob's offer:** While Bob is getting a larger share, it's still a significant amount for Alice, especially considering the declining value of the money. 

By accepting, Alice secures some value from the $100, even though it's less than she initially aimed for. Rejecting could lead to a scenario where Bob's offer becomes even less favorable in future rounds due to inflation."
