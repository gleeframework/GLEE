"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I'll reject this offer because it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my original offer and I rejected his counteroffer, I'll try to make a new offer that's even more favorable to me.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

I'm proposing a 70-30 split this time, hoping it will be more acceptable to Bob."
