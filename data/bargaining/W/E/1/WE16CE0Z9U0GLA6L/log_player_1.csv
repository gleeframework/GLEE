Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly with 55% for me and 45% for you.  We can still both get a good chunk of money before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
