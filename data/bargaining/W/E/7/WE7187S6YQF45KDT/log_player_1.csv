"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept this offer and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but I'm confident that it's still a good deal considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already biting, and my share is worth 5% less than it was just a round ago!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my share is worth 5% less than in Round 2, due to inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, Bob. But I'm not going to give away too much. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
