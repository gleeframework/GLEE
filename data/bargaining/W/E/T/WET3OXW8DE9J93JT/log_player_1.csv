"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30% less, but I'll take the lead 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less this round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate better terms in future rounds. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
