"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to start, hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly.  I'm confident I can get more in future rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm losing 20% of my potential earnings with each round, I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share than in Round 1, hoping to incentivize him to accept. The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe I can still get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential earnings, I'm no longer confident I can secure a better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer will at least ensure that I get some money."
