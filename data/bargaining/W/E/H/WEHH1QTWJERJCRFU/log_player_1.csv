Let's see if Bob agrees to my generous offer! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with inflation, I'm still getting $1,000, which is better than nothing. Let's see if Bob agrees to my acceptance!"
