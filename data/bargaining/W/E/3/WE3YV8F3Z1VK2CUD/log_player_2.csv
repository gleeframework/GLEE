Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I'm not backing down. My offer is still higher than yours, let's see if you're willing to take it 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While the deal is getting worse, it's still better to hold out hope for a better offer than to accept a 43/57 split. I need to firmly reiterate my position in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is fair and the clock is ticking.  Accept this deal now before the inflation eats away at any potential gains for us both!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not feeling the pressure, Bob. My offer is still better for me, and the inflation is only hurting you. Take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the rapidly increasing inflation is pushing me to make a difficult decision.  While I still believe a more even split is fair, accepting Alice's offer now guarantees me something rather than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
