"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the decreasing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases faster for me. I'll accept 55/45, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

Explanation: Since the money's value is decreasing faster for Alice, and she is willing to accept a 55/45 split in her favor, which is a relatively fair offer considering the inflation, it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
