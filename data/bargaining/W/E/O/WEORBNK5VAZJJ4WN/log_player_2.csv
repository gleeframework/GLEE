Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 650000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that time is running out, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Importantly, she's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. My previous offer of 75/25 is more than fair at this point, and I believe she'll be increasingly likely to accept a deal closer to my terms as the rounds progress and her potential gains diminish."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's be sensible and end this here.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Sticking to the previous offer for now maintains a firm position. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against Alice, and she's likely to get increasingly desperate for a deal as the rounds continue. There's no need to concede further yet."
