Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing by continuing to play."
