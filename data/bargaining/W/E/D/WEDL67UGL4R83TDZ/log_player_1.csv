"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4 to 6""
}
```

This offer is a relatively even split, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

```"

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking control, but willing to negotiate""
}
```"

  ""message"": ""No way, I'm not getting left with scraps""
}
```"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more extreme offer to see if Bob will accept. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm calling the shots""
}
```"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting very little, I'm taking most of the pie 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is extremely lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I would be left with a very small share of the money. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, that's not even a fair split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a final offer that's more extreme, but still somewhat reasonable. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 10000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, you win, I'll take nothing""
}
```

This offer is essentially a surrender, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that this is the worst possible outcome for him and will accept a more balanced split."
