"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a pretty generous deal to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation rate means that accepting this offer is better than risking a further reduction in my gains."
