"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to do slightly better. I'll offer 55% to myself and 45% to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly. With Alice's offer, I'd gain 400,000, which is equivalent to 50% of the original amount, considering inflation.

I'll accept Alice's offer, as it's a decent split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns.
