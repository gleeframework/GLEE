"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 90 dollars, leaving 10 for Bob. This seems fair considering the money is worth less for him in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm going to propose a slightly lower offer for Bob. Since he rejected my previous offer, and inflation is working against him, I think he'll be more likely to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is getting increasingly attractive for him due to inflation. Accepting this will ensure I get some money, while rejecting could lead to nothing for either of us."
