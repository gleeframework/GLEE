"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small amount to start, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split for the first round. Let's see if we can agree on a fair distribution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 500,000 in this round is actually worth 400,000 in real terms.

I'd like to reject this offer because I'm hoping to gain more than 400,000 in real terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You proposed an equal split last round, but I think I can do better than that. This is a slightly better offer for me, but still a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is still worth 20% less due to inflation, so I'm proposing a slightly larger share for myself."
