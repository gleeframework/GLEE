I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me taking 6000 and Bob taking 4000. This seems fair, as it's a significant share for both of us. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, it's a fair split considering the inflation and it's better than risking further reduction in the next round."
