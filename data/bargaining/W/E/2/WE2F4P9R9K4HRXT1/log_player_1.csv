This is a tough situation, but it's time to cut losses. Accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action at this point:

* **Time Pressure:** Only two rounds remain.  Continuing risks a complete loss for both players.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is severely eroding your potential gains with each passing round.
* **Unlikely Shift:** Bob has shown no indication of accepting a less favorable deal.

While not ideal, accepting secures you a significant sum, even with the inflation, rather than risking a total loss."
