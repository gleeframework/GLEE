"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a little more than half. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to potentially get more than $4000. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a chance to accept a better deal for me. Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly.  Inflation is affecting both of us, so a 50/50 split seems fairest. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a good deal for me at this point. The money is worth 19% less for me than in the first round, but I'm still getting $5000, which is more than the $4000 initially offered. I don't want to risk losing more value in subsequent rounds, so I'll accept this offer."
