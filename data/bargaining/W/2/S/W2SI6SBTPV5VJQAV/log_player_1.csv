"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a risky opening, but I want to see if I can secure a large share early on.  I'm taking advantage of the fact that Bob doesn't know about the inflation yet, so he might be more likely to accept a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is generous, it's not worth it for me to accept. I know that the money is worth less each round, and I'm hoping to get a larger share. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly from the first round, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. The inflation is becoming a factor, but I believe I can still get a good deal if I play my cards right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better for me than the previous rounds considering the inflation.  While I'd prefer more, I'm worried that if I reject this, I'll end up with even less in the next round."
