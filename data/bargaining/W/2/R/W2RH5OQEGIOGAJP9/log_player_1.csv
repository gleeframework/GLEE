"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer that slightly favors me, but still gives Bob a significant amount, considering the value of money decreases more for him with each round. Let's see if he accepts or decides to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less now due to inflation, his proposed division doesn't significantly improve my share considering the devaluation. It's still early in the game, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed and see how Bob reacts to the increasing pressure of inflation on his share.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm: In round 3, when I make my next proposal, the money will be worth 10% less for me than in round 2, and 20% less for Bob than in round 2, correct?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still believe I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's settle this before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to slightly increase Bob's share while still maintaining a larger portion for myself. Given the effects of inflation, the actual value we both receive is decreasing, but the proportional increase in Bob's share should make the offer more appealing to him. I'm trying to balance between maximizing my gain and making an offer that's acceptable to Bob, considering the pressure of inflation on both of us.\n\n###\n\nLet me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nAlso, keep in mind that for the next round, if Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth even less for both of us, but more significantly for Bob. This could be a crucial point in our negotiations.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\nAnd just to clarify again: If Bob rejects and we go to round 4, the money I gain will be worth 10% less than in round 3, and the money Bob gains will be worth 20% less than in round 3, correct?\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nThanks for facilitating our game!\n\n###\n\nBest, Alice.\n\n###\n\nP.S. If we could speed up the communication a bit, that would be great. Time is money, and in this game, money is losing value fast!\n\n###\n\nHa ha, looking forward to the next step.\n\n###\n\nThanks again!"
