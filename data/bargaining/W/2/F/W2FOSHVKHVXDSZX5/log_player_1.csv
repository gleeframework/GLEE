"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I've included a message ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I need more. We can both benefit in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a compromise with Bob. Since the money is worth 5% less to me now, I'm willing to give Bob a bit more to try to reach an agreement. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more to stay in this game. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's settle""
}
```

I've reduced my offer again, trying to find a middle ground with Bob. Since the money is worth even less to me now due to inflation, I'm willing to give Bob a bit more to try to reach an agreement before it's too late. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
