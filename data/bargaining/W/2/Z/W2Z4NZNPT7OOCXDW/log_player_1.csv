"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not being too generous yet.""
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet. I'm hoping to get a better offer from you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,800.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a better deal than the first one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
