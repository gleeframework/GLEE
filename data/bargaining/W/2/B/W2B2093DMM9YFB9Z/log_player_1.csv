"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and giving Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better for both of us. I'm willing to give you 40% this time, but I'm hoping we can reach a more balanced split in the future. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I'm still getting 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000, but Bob's 60% is worth 10% less, so he's getting $540,000 (0.9 x $600,000).

Considering the relative values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still looking for a fair split.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a balanced split."
