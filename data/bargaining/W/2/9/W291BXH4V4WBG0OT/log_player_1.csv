"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up as much as I was in the first round, but I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
