"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually gaining 50% of the original amount, which is $50. Bob's offer would give me $40, which is a smaller share than I was initially hoping for.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing more value due to further inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer and take the $40.
