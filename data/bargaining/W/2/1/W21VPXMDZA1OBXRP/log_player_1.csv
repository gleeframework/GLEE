"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me, but it's still too early to accept. I'm going to keep playing and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to increase my proposed share slightly, but still leave some room for negotiation.  Let's see if this is enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm not convinced he's going to offer me more, but I'll see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer.  The inflation is starting to take a toll on Bob, so I'm hoping he'll realize he's not going to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I think I can do better than 60.  I'll see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a slightly higher offer than my previous one. Bob's share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, so I hope this will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, but Bob's offer is getting significantly worse with each round. At this rate, we might end up with nothing.  I'm going to accept this offer and take what I can get."
