700000.0,300000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This is a fair offer considering the potential risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fairer considering the risk of inflation. This ensures we both get a decent share while acknowledging the potential for the money to lose value.,Bob,2,
