"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good chunk of change!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be equal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000.

I'm not interested in an equal split, I'd rather take a bit more. I'll reject this offer.
