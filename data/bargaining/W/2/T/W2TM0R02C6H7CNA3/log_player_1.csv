"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and kept $600,000 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's divide it fairly"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he accepts, the game is over and we get the agreed amounts. If he rejects, it's his turn to make a counteroffer, but remember, the money is worth 20% less to him in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's do this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to accept an offer that gives me less than what I offered Bob in the first round. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You should have taken the first offer""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to $700,000 and decrease Bob's share to $300,000. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I'm taking advantage of this fact to try to get a better deal. My message to Bob is a reminder that he should have taken my first offer when he had the chance!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of an even split, with each of us getting $500,000. Given that the money is worth the same to me in each round, and considering that Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round), I think this is a fair deal. Plus, Bob has indicated that this is his final offer, so I don't want to risk losing out on a reasonable agreement. It's time to shake hands and walk away with my half a million dollars!"
