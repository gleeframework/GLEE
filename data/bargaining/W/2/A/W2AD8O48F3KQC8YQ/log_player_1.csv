{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with a 40/60 split, especially since I'm not sure how much the money is worth to Bob due to the inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if we can find a better split."

While Bob is offering a slightly better deal than before, I'm still not satisfied with the 46/54 split. I think I can do better, especially since I'm not sure how much the money is worth to Bob due to the inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if we can find a better split."

After considering the offer, I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's the best one I've seen so far. I'm getting a slightly larger share than before, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds. Plus, I'm not sure how much the money is worth to Bob due to the inflation, so I'm taking what I can get."
