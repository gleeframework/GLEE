"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I want to ensure we both get something closer to a 50/50 split.  Let's get this done before the value drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
