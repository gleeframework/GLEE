"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI offered to take $55, giving Bob $45, with a message suggesting that it's a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The 5% decrease in value isn't too significant yet, and I'd like to try to negotiate a more favorable split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'll offer a split that's closer to the middle, taking $52 and giving Bob $48. My message suggests that this is a compromise between our previous offers, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
