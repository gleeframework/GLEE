"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

 I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This ensures a substantial gain for me, while still providing Bob with a small reward. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my potential gains. Let's see what I can offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share a little bit, but still keep a significant portion.  I'll offer Bob 300,000 dollars, hoping this is enticing enough for him to accept.  It's still a better deal for him than the last round, and it ensures we both get something before the inflation eats away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, it still significantly undervalues my share. Inflation is hitting Bob's share much harder than mine, so it's likely that in the next round, he'll need to offer me a more equitable split to avoid getting nothing at all. I'm going to stick with my strategy of focusing on getting a sizable share while also offering Bob enough to potentially tempt him into accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm confident that it's still a good deal for both of us. We're nearing the halfway point of the game, and the pressure is on. With inflation biting into Bob's share, I believe this offer might just be enough to entice him to accept and end this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to being equal than in the previous rounds, it's still far from ideal.  Inflation is clearly impacting Bob's share more than mine, and I believe this pressure will force him to make a more substantial offer in the next round.  I'm going to stick to my strategy of aiming for a larger share and see if Bob is willing to compromise more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This round, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Inflation has been impacting both of us, and I think it's time we both recognize the need for compromise.  This is a fair and equitable solution, and hopefully, Bob will finally see the value in it."
