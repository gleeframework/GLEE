"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to give you a chance to make a better offer.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a generous approach, now it's my turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm willing to end the game here."
