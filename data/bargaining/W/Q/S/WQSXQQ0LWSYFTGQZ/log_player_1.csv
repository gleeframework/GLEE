"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I want to maximize my gain early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 80/20, hoping that Bob sees the value in getting something now rather than risking getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. My losses from inflation are getting significant, but I'm willing to risk it for a slightly higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 70/30.  Inflation is hitting hard, but I think Bob will recognize that he's getting a better deal than he would if we keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky. My losses from inflation are significant. I'll accept Bob's offer, as getting 30% is better than nothing."
