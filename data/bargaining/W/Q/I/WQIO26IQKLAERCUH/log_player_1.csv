"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can still think of the offer as 40/60.

I'll reject this offer since I'd like to get a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more now 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can still think of the offer as 45/55.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is the same as in Round 2, which I had rejected. Given the inflation, the value of Bob's share has decreased, making it even less appealing to me. I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for an even larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more now that the value of money has decreased""
}
```"
