Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'll take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a tiny amount. My reasoning is that I want to see if Bob is willing to accept even a small amount in the first round. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a classic example of the ultimatum game. I will reject this offer. It's true that I get something, but it's only $1000, and if I keep rejecting, I can likely get a much better deal. In the next round, Bob will be losing a significant amount of money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob. While I'm still keeping the majority, I'm acknowledging that Bob's offer was a little too extreme, and I want to show that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer again. Bob's offer is still very one-sided, and the inflation is starting to hurt him significantly.  By rejecting, I'm hoping to push him to make a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making a significant concession this round, offering Bob 40% of the money.  The inflation is taking its toll on Bob, and I believe this offer is more balanced.  I'm still aiming to get the majority, but I need to find a middle ground to avoid running out of rounds."
