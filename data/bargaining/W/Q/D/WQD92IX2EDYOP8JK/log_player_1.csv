"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This takes into account the decreasing value of money for me in future rounds.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
