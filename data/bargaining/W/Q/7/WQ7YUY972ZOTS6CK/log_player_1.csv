"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, let's end it here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it almost evenly, I think this is fair. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 49 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 51 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best offer I'll get, so I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much."
