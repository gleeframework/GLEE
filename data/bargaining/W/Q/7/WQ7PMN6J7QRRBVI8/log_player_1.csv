"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept, as he's likely to get less in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, I am still in a better position if I reject. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a majority for myself. I need to be careful with inflation, but I'm also trying to ensure Bob doesn't become completely unmotivated to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to hurt, and even though this is significantly less than what I initially wanted, accepting is the best option. I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round, and I'm likely to lose more money due to inflation."
