Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I could try for a slightly better outcome in the next round, there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything better than an even split. Accepting now ensures a fair outcome without risking further losses due to inflation."
