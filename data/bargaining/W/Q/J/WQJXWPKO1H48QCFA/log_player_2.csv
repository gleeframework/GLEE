"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the funds with an 80/20 ratio, favoring you in the first round. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I could potentially negotiate for a better deal in later rounds, accepting this offer guarantees me $2,000 right away. There's no guarantee that Alice will offer me a better deal in the future, and with inflation, the money will be worth less each round."
