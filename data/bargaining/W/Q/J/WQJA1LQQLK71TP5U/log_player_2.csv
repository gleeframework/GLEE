Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob, even though it's a highly unfavorable split. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is losing almost 60% of the value due to inflation with each round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers from Alice, as she knows Bob is desperate to settle due to the rapidly devaluing money.

By accepting the current offer, Bob at least secures $300,000 (even though it's worth much less than it would have been in earlier rounds). Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the next round is incredibly risky at this point."
