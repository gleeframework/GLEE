"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With the inflation rate, the money is devaluing rapidly, and I don't want to end up with a smaller share in real terms.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping to balance the value of the money between us, considering the inflation rates."
