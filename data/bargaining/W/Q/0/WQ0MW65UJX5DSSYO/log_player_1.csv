"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in Round 2, my gain of $300,000 is actually $240,000 in real value.

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a bigger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob after my previous rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking more this time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less in Round 4, my gain of $200,000 is actually $104,800 in real value.

I'm not getting any younger, and I need to think about getting some money now. I'll accept this offer.
