"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I don't like the fact that Bob is taking the majority, but I suppose it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer to get something out of it.
