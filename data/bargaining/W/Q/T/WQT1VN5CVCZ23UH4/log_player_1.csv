"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, we can negotiate more if you want to!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, I'm the one making the offer now! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $3800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $5400.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing gains. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
