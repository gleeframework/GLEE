Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to try and get the game over quickly. Since I don't know how inflation impacts him, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my gains are worth 20% less, Bob's offer gives me $60.  Even with the inflation, this is a significant amount. It's likely that Bob will get even more money if we continue, so I'll accept this offer."
