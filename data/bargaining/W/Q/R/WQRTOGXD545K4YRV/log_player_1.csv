"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not going to let you take the whole pie! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a big chunk of the pie!

I'll have to be careful with this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think about whether it's worth accepting a smaller share.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal, especially since I'm already facing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big bite last round, but I'm still hungry! Will you share some more?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'll give you a bit more this time. Don't get too comfortable! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take the upper hand!

Considering the offer, I'll take into account the 27.1% inflation, which means the money I gain is now worth even less than in the previous rounds. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting this offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal, especially since the money is worth even less for me now."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. Your turn, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice! I'm taking a firmer stance now. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive as the rounds go by!

Considering the offer, I'll take into account the 40.95% inflation, which means the money I gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting this offer, given the time constraint.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm also aware that time is running out. I'll have to be more strategic in my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 240000,
  ""bob_gain"": 760000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to find a compromise. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced deal, considering the significant inflation that's affecting my share. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
