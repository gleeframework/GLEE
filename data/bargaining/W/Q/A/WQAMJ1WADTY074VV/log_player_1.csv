"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I figure Bob might be tempted to accept even a small amount, since he has a chance to propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. Bob is playing the same high-risk strategy.  He's trying to force my hand. Let's see if he'll give in in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999998, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep the vast majority of the money.  Bob's rejection of my previous offer suggests he's playing a long game, but I think this might be enough to convince him to take a small piece."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 999998 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

We're in a stalemate. Both of us are playing a risky game. I'll reject his offer again, hoping to get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999997, ""bob_gain"": 3}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer by a small amount.  I'm hoping that the pattern will become clear to Bob, and he'll realize that he's unlikely to get more than a small share if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 999997

I'm sticking to my strategy. I'm not going to give in to his tactics just yet.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal if we keep playing."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999996, ""bob_gain"": 4}
```

I'm continuing to raise my offer by one dollar each round. The pattern is clear: Bob is trying to get a larger share, but I'm holding firm. It's getting late in the game; I think he'll realize he's better off taking a small piece than getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 999996

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999995, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm getting closer to the end of the game. I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that he's not going to get more than a small share. It's a risky move, but I'm going to try to push for a little bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 999995 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to give in to his pressure. We're running out of time, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm not going to settle for a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999994, ""bob_gain"": 6}
```

This is it!  I'm taking a gamble and offering a bit more. I have a feeling that Bob will get scared of getting nothing and finally accept. It's all or nothing now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6 
# Bob gain: 999994 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a disappointing outcome, but I'll accept the offer.  I'm not happy with the result, but it's better than getting nothing at all.  I learned a valuable lesson about risk and negotiation.  I should have been more flexible in my offers and perhaps tried to reach a compromise sooner."
