Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'll take 999,000 and leave you with 1,000.  It's a fair deal, considering the inflation. ðŸ˜Ž 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating away at my share!  I'm offering you 450,000, take it or leave it. This is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous.  I'll take 990,000 and give you 10,000.  You're getting a better deal than you think with all this inflation. ðŸ˜‰ 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's clear Alice is trying to maximize her gain and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better. Accepting the 10,000 is better than risking getting a much smaller amount or even nothing in the next round."
