Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, knowing that the money will be worth less to me in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a small share for a quick payout."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'd prefer more, it's better to take 500,000 now than risk getting nothing at all.  The inflation is making the money worth less each round, so accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible option."
