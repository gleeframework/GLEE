This is a tough spot. While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Shrinking Value:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting longer means getting even less. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems set on getting a larger share and is unlikely to budge much. 
* **Minimal Gains by Waiting:**  The difference between this offer and potentially squeezing out a tiny bit more in a later round is likely not worth the loss Bob will face from inflation. 

It's frustrating, but sometimes the best negotiation tactic is to cut your losses."
