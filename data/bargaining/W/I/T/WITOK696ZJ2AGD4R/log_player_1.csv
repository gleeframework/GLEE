Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money. I'm willing to give you a 20% share, which is more than the initial offer. It's now or never! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
