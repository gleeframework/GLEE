Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous to Bob, hoping that he'll be more likely to accept the offer.  We'll see how things go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I get less than I initially proposed, I'm still getting a decent share of the money. It's risky to keep rejecting offers as the inflation rate could affect me in the next round."
