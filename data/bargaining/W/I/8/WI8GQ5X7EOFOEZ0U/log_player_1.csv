"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game here!""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting with the same amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair compromise, let's split it this way. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a bigger share of the pie. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll propose a new offer that takes this into account.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, where I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, given the reduced value of the money."
