Let's start fair and even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share than he offered me, but I'm confident he'll accept.  I think he'll realize that if he rejects this, he risks getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get. Inflation is making the money worth less with every round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future."
