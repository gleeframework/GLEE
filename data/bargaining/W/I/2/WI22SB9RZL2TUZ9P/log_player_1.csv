"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering to give you $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to trick me into accepting a worse deal!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful. Let me calculate the actual values:

My gain: 450,000 x 0.95 = 427,500
Bob's gain: 550,000 x 0.8 = 440,000

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. It seems like Bob is getting a better deal than me, despite the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob. Let me make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm offering you $520,000 and keeping $480,000 for myself."
