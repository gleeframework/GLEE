"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering the inflation rates. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I've taken into account the inflation rates and adjusted my offer to try to find a middle ground. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this proposal!"
