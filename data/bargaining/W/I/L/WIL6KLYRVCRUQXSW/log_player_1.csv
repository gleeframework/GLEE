"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, my friend! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, as it's a 50-50 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to meet in the middle, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still the one doing the work""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think I deserve it 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1%). I'm getting desperate, but I don't want to give up too much.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 60-40 split, as it's a significant concession from my previous offers. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to give up that much, I'll try to get a better deal""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64.19% of what it was in the first round (72.9% of 88.9%). I'll try to make a final offer that's slightly more aggressive.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm making one last push, meet me in the middle or I'll walk away""
}
```"
