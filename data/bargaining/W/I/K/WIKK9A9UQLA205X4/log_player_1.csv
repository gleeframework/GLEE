"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping to get as much as possible in the first round.  This leaves room for potential negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not happy with the outcome, I'm going to accept. Given the inflation, and the fact that Bob could continue to offer me $1000 and take the rest until the 12th round, this is the best outcome for me."
