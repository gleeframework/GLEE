"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, where I get 80 dollars and Bob gets 20 dollars. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."
