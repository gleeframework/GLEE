"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not too generous 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the new values are:

* Alice's gain: $6,000 x 0.8 = $4,800
* Bob's gain: $4,000 x 0.9 = $3,600

Bob's offer in Round 2 is:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the reduced value of the money.
