"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Since the money doesn't lose value for Bob, he might be inclined to wait, but I'm hoping the prospect of getting $40 right away will be enticing enough for him to accept. The message is a gentle nudge towards accepting the offer, framing it as a fair division.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth more to me than to you right now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less to me, Bob's offer of $45 is actually equivalent to $36 in the first round. Considering this, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn! Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is now worth even less to me, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still getting a decent share for myself. I'll offer $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, which is a slightly more even split.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, considering the circumstances""}\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
