Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, aiming for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards to account for the inflation, but still offering a significant portion to Bob to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, the inflation makes the offer increasingly unfavorable for both of us. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option for me at this point."
