I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to get this over quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair and, even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll make my own counteroffer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to acknowledge the inflation, but I still believe this is a fair split.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being stubborn! I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair. I'm hoping Bob will realize we're both losing money with each passing round and agree to a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable!  I'm not giving in to his demands.  I'll make a counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm getting tired of this back and forth. I'm reducing my offer again, but this is getting close to my limit. I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and accept."
