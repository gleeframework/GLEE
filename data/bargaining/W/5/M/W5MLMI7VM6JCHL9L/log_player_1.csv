"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a larger share to make up for the loss. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly! With it being worth 48.8% less than the initial amount, I need to be cautious. Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, it's a reasonable offer considering the current value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
