"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60, a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I think 40 is a more reasonable share for me, considering the initial amount was $100. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think 55 is a fair share""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
