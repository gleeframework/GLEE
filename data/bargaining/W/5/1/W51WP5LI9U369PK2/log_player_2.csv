"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is not fair, and since there are many rounds, it's worth risking it to see if Alice will offer something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3875 
# Alice gain: 6125 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is now more appealing due to inflation. While it's not an ideal split, it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds."
