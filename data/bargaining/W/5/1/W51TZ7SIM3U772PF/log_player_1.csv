"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't refuse! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's the boss, huh?

I'll play along. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced by Bob's leadership style, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, my proposal will be slightly more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're not the boss, but I'll give you a better deal""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to keep the upper hand. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a taste of your own medicine! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

I'm not getting desperate, but I do need to think carefully about this offer. Considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, I'll have to consider the offer more carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good deal, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing for me. I'll try to do better next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, so I'll have to be strategic.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, but I'm getting smart""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money, but still trying to maintain a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of options, I'm calling the shots now! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

I'm running out of options, but I'm not ready to give up yet. However, considering the massive decrease in the value of the money for me, I'll have to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 2000, even though it's a relatively small amount. At least I'll have some money left, even if it's not worth as much as it used to be."
