Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  We're already at round 5 of 12, and the money is worth substantially less. Waiting any longer dramatically increases the risk of getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice's offers have been slowly moving closer to a more even split. It's unlikely she'll drastically improve her offer, especially with the time pressure.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal is a huge gamble. The potential loss from continued inflation outweighs the potential gain of a few extra thousand dollars, especially considering those dollars are worth less every round."
