"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too unfair to accept. While I understand the pressure of inflation, a 5/95 split is not a viable outcome for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is a huge step backwards from my initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. This should be a fairer split than the previous round and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enough to secure an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still significantly unfair to me, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  While I'm getting increasingly desperate, I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is just too much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm taking another step back, but still offering Bob a reasonable share. I need to secure an agreement before the inflation completely eats away at my potential gains. I'm hoping this offer shows my willingness to compromise and will encourage Bob to accept."
