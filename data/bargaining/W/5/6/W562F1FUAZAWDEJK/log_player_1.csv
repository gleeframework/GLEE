"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob. This way we both get a decent chunk of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. We can both get a good amount, and we avoid risking losing too much money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000
* Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.9 = 495,000

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
