6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to be fair, Alice.  This offer accounts for some of the inflation, but we both get a decent share.",Bob,2,
,,"This offer still doesn't reflect the faster rate of inflation I'm experiencing, Bob. Let's try for a more equitable split.",Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking, and my share is losing value fast. This offer gives us both something, but I need you to be realistic about the inflation difference.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution to ensure we both get something valuable.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, it doesn't make sense with the current inflation rates.  I'm losing value significantly faster than you. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer isn't sustainable.",Alice,4,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, time is running out. This is a compromise - slightly lower than my previous offer but still accounts for the rapid inflation affecting my share.  Let's close this deal and both get something.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, with each round, the value of our money keeps decreasing.  I'm willing to take a slight loss to ensure we both get something meaningful.  Let's split it 45/55, acknowledging the inflation but securing a decent share for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, Bob, I accept.  It's not ideal, but the value is diminishing rapidly with each passing round.  Better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all.",Alice,6,accept
