"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  I'll take 60, you get 40.  What do you say?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60, I'll take a bit more this time. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, I'll compromise.  Let's split it 48 for me, 52 for you.  This is my final offer.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You compromised to 48, I'll take an even bigger share this time. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, at this point, accepting is the best option.  The alternative is to risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my next offer, making this a very risky gamble."
