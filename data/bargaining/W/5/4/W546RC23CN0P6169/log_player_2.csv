"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth a lot. This offer gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting a fair deal, but I need a bit more. This offer considers the inflation and still gives us both a decent amount.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to factor in the rapid inflation. Delaying benefits Bob more than Alice.
* **Strategic Counter:** Alice's opening offer heavily favored her.  This counter-offer is still tilted in Bob's favor but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message Tone:** Keeping the message polite but firm reinforces Bob's position without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  Let's be reasonable.  This offer gives you more than you'd get in the next round, even with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff:** Alice's message implies urgency, but she's still heavily favoring herself. This could be a bluff to pressure Bob.
* **Favorable Inflation:** While both are losing money, the inflation disproportionately hurts Alice in the next round.  Bob has a stronger position.
* **Holding Out for More:**  Bob's previous offer was reasonable. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on Alice to offer a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this settled.  Let's stop wasting time with the games. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:**  By round 4, the inflation has significantly eroded the value. Continuing to haggle over small differences is pointless.
* **Strong, Fair Stance:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair and gives Alice a clear reason to accept. Rejecting this offer would make Alice seem unreasonable. 
* **Direct Communication:**  The message removes the ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation. Bob is serious about ending the game now."
