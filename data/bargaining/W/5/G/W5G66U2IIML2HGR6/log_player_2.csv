Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your share's value is plummeting. I'm being generous with 56-44. Don't wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob, even though it's not a great deal. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Returns:** Bob's share is losing value exponentially with each round. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse offer from Alice.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has shown she's comfortable dragging out the negotiations. This suggests she might not budge much from her current offer.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While 44% is far from ideal, it's better than risking another round and potentially getting an even smaller share, or even nothing at all if Alice plays hardball.

While Bob could gamble on one more counter-offer, the risk significantly outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
