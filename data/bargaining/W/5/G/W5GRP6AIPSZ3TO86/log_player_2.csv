"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable. This offer is still heavily in your favor compared to a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's find a compromise. This is closer to the middle ground.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a fair offer, and it's closer to what I want. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While time is ticking, accepting an offer this early when it's significantly less than what I've been proposing sets a bad precedent.  Alice might be stubborn, but I'm hoping she'll move closer to a 50/50 split if I continue to hold out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to meet you halfway. This offer is a reasonable compromise.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time!  This is my final offer -  it's a fair split and gives us both a good amount of money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one. Ideally, I'd hold out for a bit more, but Alice is sounding more insistent and we're down to the wire. Accepting this guarantees I get something, and it's still a good amount of money. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting nothing if Alice is serious about this being her final offer."
