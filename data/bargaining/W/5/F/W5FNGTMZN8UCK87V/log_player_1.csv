Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a better share, considering the original amount was $1,000,000. The 400,000 I'd get in this offer is still a significant decrease from my original proposal of 500,000. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because at this point, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth less and less with each passing round, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a tiny share. I'll take the 200,000 and call it a day."
