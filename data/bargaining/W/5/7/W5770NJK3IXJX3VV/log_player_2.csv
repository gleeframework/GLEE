"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation affects us both, but I'm still willing to be fair. Let's split it 55/45, and end this already! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less for me now, and considering Alice's offer is not that much better than the original 50/50 split, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. The fact that Alice is willing to be ""fair"" and split it 55/45 doesn't take into account the fact that I'm the one being affected by inflation, not her. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, I need a better deal to make up for it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is rough, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, and end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the money is now worth 59.04% less for me, and Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous one, I think it's time to accept. The fact that Alice is still willing to compromise is a good sign, and I don't think I can get a much better deal at this point. The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains, so I'll take the 40% and end the game here."
