Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable, considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
