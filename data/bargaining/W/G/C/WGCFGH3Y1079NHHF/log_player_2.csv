"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I deserve a little more considering the inflation.  How about this split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet halfway, Bob.  I'll take a little less, but I think we can still make this work. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  This offer is more than fair considering the inflation working against me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't take much less than this. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are significant. Accepting Alice's offer gives me $5800, which is worth significantly less than it was in Round 1, but it's better than risking getting nothing if I push my luck further.
