"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness too, Alice. How about we switch roles? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to be serious.  Let's switch those numbers and settle this. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to mirror my tactics and gain a slight advantage.  I need to incentivize him to accept a deal that benefits me more, and quickly, before inflation eats away at the potential gains. I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 505000,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right about the cost of time, Alice. How about we split the difference and call it a deal? 
# Alice gain: 495000 
# Bob gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still stubbornly mirroring my offers with a slight advantage for himself. I need to switch tactics to break this deadlock. By continuing to reject his mirrored offers, I'm hoping he'll realize that simply waiting me out won't work. I'll make a more drastic offer in the next round to see if I can shake things up and get ahead of the inflation game."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alright Bob, enough games.  I'm taking a bigger share this time. It's better than watching the money shrink to nothing. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The games stop now, Alice.  I'm taking a slight majority to end this, or we both lose big. Decide. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally shifted his strategy away from simply mirroring my offers. While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point.  The inflation rate is steadily eating away at the total, and I need to secure a reasonable sum before it diminishes further. Waiting any longer significantly risks walking away with nothing."
