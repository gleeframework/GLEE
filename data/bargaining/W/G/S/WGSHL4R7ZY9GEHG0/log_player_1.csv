"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly. No need to fight over this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more even split this time. With the inflation factor, my gain of 500,000 is actually worth 450,000 in real value. Still a good offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet. I'll reject it for now.

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 700,000 is now worth 511,000 in real value. Considering Bob's offer, my gain of 600,000 is worth 463,400 in real value. This is a decent offer, but I'm still not sure if I should accept it yet. I'll reject it for now.

This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm starting to think that I should accept it. The inflation is eating into my potential gains, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
