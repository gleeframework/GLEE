I'll start by offering Bob a small amount to see if he's willing to accept a quick and easy deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  I'm not willing to take such a small share, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll offer Bob a larger share this time, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for a good share, but I recognize the need to compromise to avoid reaching the end without a deal."
