# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to find a middle ground that is fair for both of us. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in splitting the money more evenly, especially considering the decreasing value for me. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need more than 4000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Although the money is worth 36% less for me now, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Alice is willing to compromise, I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  We both lose if we don't come to an agreement. Let's split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept this offer. Although the money is worth 59.04% less for me now, a 50/50 split seems like a fair deal, especially considering the risk of losing everything if we don't come to an agreement. I'll take the 5000, even though its value has decreased significantly. It's better than getting nothing!"
