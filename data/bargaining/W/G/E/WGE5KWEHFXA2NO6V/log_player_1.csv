"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is still a significant amount, considering the money will be worth 20% less for him after one round. I'm keeping $60 for myself, which is a fair share, considering the inflation will only affect me by 5% after one round."
