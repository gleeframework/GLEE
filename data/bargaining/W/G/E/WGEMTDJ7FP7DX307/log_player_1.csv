"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

As for Bob's offer, a 50-50 split is a good compromise, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up the extra 1000$ I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob is making the offer this round.

Since the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly lower gain than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is a good compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
