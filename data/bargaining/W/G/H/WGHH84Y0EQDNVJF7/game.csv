4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You'll lose more value in the next round, so it's better to accept this.",Bob,2,

4200.0,5800.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I believe this offer is more than fair. It's wise for you to accept now before the value drops further.",Bob,4,

5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, we're approaching a critical point. This offer is my final attempt to find a compromise. If you reject it, the inflation will hurt us both even more, making a mutually beneficial agreement nearly impossible.",Alice,5,
