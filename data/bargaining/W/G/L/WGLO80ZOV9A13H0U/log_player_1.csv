"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I should be more cautious. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, this offer seems more favorable to me. Since I'm not getting a better offer than in Round 3, and Bob's gain is now worth significantly less, I'll accept this offer.
