"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm trying to be friendly and open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 60 and you can have 40. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too generous for him. I'd rather try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split. Can you meet me at 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again due to inflation!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Don't try to take advantage of me!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway now. 50/50 is a fair split. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more reasonable now!

Considering the offer, I think a 50/50 split is a good compromise, especially since the money is worth less and less with each round. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you've convinced me. 50/50 it is!""
}
```"
