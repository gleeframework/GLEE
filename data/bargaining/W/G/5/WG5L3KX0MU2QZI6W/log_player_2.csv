"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current offer is not in my favor, considering the inflation rate is 0% for me and 5% for Alice. I have 11 more rounds to try and get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'm excited to see what she comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45?""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my offer, taking into account the inflation rate difference between us. Let's see if Alice is willing to accept it or if we'll move on to the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, Bob, but I think a 48-52 split is a fair compromise. Let's reach an agreement before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. The 52-48 split is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think I can get a better deal considering the inflation rate difference. The fact that the money loses more value for Alice with each passing round gives me a bit of leverage. Let's see what the next round brings!\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'm curious to see how she'll adjust her offer next time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the increasing inflation impact on your end. How about 58-42?""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my new offer, taking into account the growing difference in the value of the money between us. Let's see if Alice is willing to accept this deal or if we'll continue negotiating!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 45-55 to avoid further losses due to inflation. It's getting risky for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation rate difference, I think a 55-45 split is a reasonable compromise. The fact that the money loses more value for Alice with each passing round means that further negotiations might not yield a significantly better deal for me. Additionally, with 7 rounds left, there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement and both end up with nothing. So, I'll take the 55-45 split to ensure I get a decent share of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've accepted her offer, and we can conclude the game!"
