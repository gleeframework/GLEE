Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth isn't helping anyone.  Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's analyze why accepting is the right decision:

* **Inflation is Hurting Bob:**  Bob's potential gains are decreasing significantly with each round. While our potential gains remain the same.
* **50/50 Split is Favorable in the Long Run:**  Although we could aim for a slightly higher amount, waiting any longer risks Bob offering even less. Accepting a 50/50 split now ensures we get a good deal considering the inflation working against him.
* **Ending the Game:** Prolonging the game introduces more risk with no guarantee of a better outcome."
