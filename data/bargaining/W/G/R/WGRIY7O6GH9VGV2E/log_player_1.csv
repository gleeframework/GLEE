**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the end, and Bob is clearly trying to edge me out. I'm holding out hope for a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's getting riskier, but I think there's still a chance to secure a better outcome."

""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my absolute final offer. Take it before we both lose!""

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a concession by dropping to Bob's previous offer. It's a strategic move, designed to create a sense of urgency and make him reconsider walking away empty-handed. It's a risk, but a calculated one at this stage."
