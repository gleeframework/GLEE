"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000 and you get $4000. This is a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal where I get 40% of the money.  I want a better split.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, Alice. I'll get a little more than you, but it's still a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. The inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I propose a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option and ensures we both leave with something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is fair, and with the inflation continuing to erode our gains, it's better to secure this split rather than risk getting nothing."
