# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly trying to inch closer to a larger share. It's risky, but I'll hold out for a better deal, knowing the stakes rise as we get closer to the final rounds."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** With fewer rounds left, the risk of getting $0 increases. I'm mirroring Alice's strategy but offering a slightly better deal than she has.  This puts the pressure on her while still giving me a decent share."

**Reasoning:** Alice is still stubbornly clinging to the higher end, even though we're running out of time.  She clearly doesn't want to go empty-handed. I'll risk it one more round and see if she cracks."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We both lose everything if we don't agree now.  Take this offer and we both walk away with something.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a high-stakes gamble, but it's time to apply maximum pressure. Alice has shown no indication of accepting anything less than 50%, but I need to try and get slightly ahead. This offer is the most appealing I've presented that still gives me an edge.  The strong message emphasizes the urgency of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** It's down to the wire. Alice is sticking to her guns, and she might be willing to let it all go to get a slightly larger share.  Accepting this offer is the only way to guarantee I get anything at this point. It's not ideal, but better than walking away with nothing."
