Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the most reasonable. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  As time passes, the value of the money decreases faster for Alice than for Bob.  It's in Alice's best interest to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strategic Concession:** While this offer is less than Alice's initial proposal, it's still a better deal for her than Bob's counter-offer. The slight concession may entice Bob to accept.
* **Direct Communication:** The message emphasizes that further delays will only hurt both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice, my turn! Inflation is hitting you harder than me. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offers are getting progressively better for him and worse for Alice. Accepting now would mean settling for a much lower amount than her initial target.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While the inflation is a concern, there's still a chance Bob might panic as the game continues. He knows Alice is losing value faster, but he's also losing value. This pressure could lead him to make a more favorable offer in the next round.
* **Calculated Risk:** Alice needs to signal she's willing to play the game and won't accept a bad deal just because of the time pressure. This rejection shows her resolve."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it - we both lose more with every passing round."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Alice needs to acknowledge that she's in a weaker position due to the faster inflation rate. This offer is a middle ground between her previous offers and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise but not capitulate.
* **Firmness and Urgency:**  The message is direct and conveys a sense of urgency. It emphasizes the shared risk of continued inflation, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** By stating this as her final offer, Alice creates a sense of finality and limits Bob's options. He can either accept this offer or risk a potentially worse outcome if the game continues."
