Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large portion of the money. I know the inflation will affect me more heavily in later rounds, so I want to secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more than $50, the inflation will make my future gains less valuable. Accepting this offer ensures I get half of the money, which is better than risking getting less in the following rounds."
