"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob receives 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more balanced split. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a more even split, and 60-40 was a good starting point. I'd like to propose my own offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about 58-42? It's still a decent split, and I'm willing to give in a bit.""}

I'm adjusting my offer to 58% for myself and 42% for Bob, trying to find a middle ground."
