"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us. This way, we both get $5,000, and we can end the game right away."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the offer in terms of its nominal value. In this case, I'd be getting $4,000, while Bob would be getting $6,000.

I'll reject this offer because I think I'm giving up too much. I'd like to get a better deal.
