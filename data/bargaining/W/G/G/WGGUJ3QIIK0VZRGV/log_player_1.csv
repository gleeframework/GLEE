"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share of the pie.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a larger share.

However, considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to keep negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. But I need a fair share too!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up more 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me halfway now.

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, especially since the money is worth much less now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer with the money continuing to lose value."
