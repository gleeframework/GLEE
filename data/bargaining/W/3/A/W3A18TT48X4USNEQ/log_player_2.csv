"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. This offer won't be as good in later rounds due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nSince Alice's money is worth 10% less in this round, I'm hoping she'll be more inclined to accept this offer, which still gives her a significant amount but tips the balance slightly in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation, but I also need a reasonable share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's money is now worth 19% less than in the first round, this offer seems reasonable. I've managed to get a slightly better deal than the initial offer, and since Alice mentions it's her final offer, I don't want to risk going into another round where I might end up with less or risk the game ending without an agreement.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
