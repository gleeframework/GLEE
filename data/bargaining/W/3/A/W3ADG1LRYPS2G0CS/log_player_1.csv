"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 400k, but it's better than nothing. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share to account for inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 480k, but I'm getting closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 480k, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of the money. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting even less in future rounds."
