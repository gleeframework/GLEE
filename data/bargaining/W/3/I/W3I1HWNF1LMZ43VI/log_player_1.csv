"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer.
