"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a simple 60/40 split. It's a good deal for both of us.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about 58/42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and the longer the game goes on, the more we both lose.  While 4200 isn't great, I want to see if I can push Alice to a more even split before accepting anything in this range."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with every round! This split is closer to even, and it benefits us both to settle sooner rather than later.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this now. I'm agreeing to your previous offer to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has finally agreed to my previous offer of a 55/45 split in her favor. While I would have preferred a more even split, accepting now prevents further losses due to inflation."
