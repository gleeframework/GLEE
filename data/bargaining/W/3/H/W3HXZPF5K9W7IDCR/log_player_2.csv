"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I think this is a good deal for both of us to avoid losing value with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rate will affect you more than me. Let's avoid losing too much money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, we're losing valuable time here. I'll give you a larger share than my last offer. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the offer.  While I'd still prefer a 60/40 split, the inflation is getting worse for Alice, and this is a good compromise."
