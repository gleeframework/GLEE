"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than the initial amount, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's 50-50 offer, I think it's a bit too even for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
