"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering 60% to myself and 40% to Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money for Bob, I'll have to think carefully.
