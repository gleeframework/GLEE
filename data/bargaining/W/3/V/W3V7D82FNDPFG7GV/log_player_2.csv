"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
