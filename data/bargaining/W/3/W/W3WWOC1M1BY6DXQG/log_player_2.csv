"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims to divide the funds in a way that ensures a fair share while considering the risk of inflation in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message emphasizes fairness and inflation, the proposed split is heavily skewed in her favor.  Since I am Bob,  I can take advantage of the inflation to potentially get a better deal in the following rounds.  By rejecting this offer, I force Alice to propose a split that is more equitable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
