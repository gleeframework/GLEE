"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share of the money, and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than 400k.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not willing to give up more than this.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but I'm not giving up too much, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. 300k is a bit too low for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 300k.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm still trying to get a better share of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 200k, but I think I deserve the majority of the money 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings! With the money being worth so much less, I'll have to be careful with my next decision.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. 200k is a relatively low amount, but it's still a significant portion of the remaining money.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a slightly better share than 200k.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait, though!"
