"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, but I think we can both do better. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too greedy, I'd like a better deal""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take a smaller share than before, but I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but still wants a slightly larger share.

Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, I still think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about meeting in the middle, I'd like a bit more""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split, it's only fair""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money!"
