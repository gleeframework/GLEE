Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob). If I reject this offer and go to another round, there's a high chance I'll end up with even less. Accepting Alice's offer, even though it favors her, guarantees me something rather than risking getting a worse deal or nothing at all."
