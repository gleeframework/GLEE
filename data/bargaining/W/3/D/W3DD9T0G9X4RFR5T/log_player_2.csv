"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I understand you want a decent amount, but it's my turn to propose. This offer still leaves you with a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're not valuing the impact of inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. Accepting Alice's offer nets Bob $40 which is worth only $16 in terms of round 1 value. 

If Bob rejects this offer, he risks:

* Further rounds with even less value due to inflation.
* Alice potentially offering even less in a future round.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer minimizes Bob's losses from the inflated currency.
