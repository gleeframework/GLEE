"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer, as he can potentially get a better deal later. While a 4000$ gain is appealing, the value of that money will decrease as the game progresses. He can likely negotiate a more favorable split by holding out for a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, but I need a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll give you a bit more, but I still want the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice has increased the offer slightly, it's still not in Bob's best interest to accept. He can likely negotiate a more favorable split by continuing to reject and forcing Alice to make a more competitive offer. Bob should be willing to hold out for a few more rounds, considering the diminishing value of the money for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a bigger share to offset the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, I need a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is offering slightly more than the previous round, but it's still not a good deal for Bob. The inflation is affecting Alice much more drastically, so she needs to offer a significantly larger share to make it worthwhile for Bob.  He should continue to reject and wait for a better offer."
