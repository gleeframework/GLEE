I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  This should hopefully encourage him to accept, but if not, I'll have a chance to adjust my strategy in the next round.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy and trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still offering Bob a decent share.  It's risky, but I think Bob is starting to see that we both need to compromise to get anything.  Hopefully, he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable.  He's now offering me a much smaller share, even though inflation is making the money worth significantly less. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to be more reasonable in the next round. I'm starting to think we may be heading for a stalemate, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still trying to find a middle ground, but Bob is pushing me to the brink.  This offer is lower than I'd like, but it's the best I can do given the inflation and Bob's stubbornness.  Hopefully, he'll see that continuing to reject offers will lead to us both getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of me, even though the money is rapidly losing value. This offer is even worse than the previous one, and I'm not going to let him walk all over me. I'm starting to think this game is doomed, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making one last attempt to find a compromise.  We're getting very close to the deadline and the value of the money is dropping drastically.  This is a big concession on my part, but I'm hoping Bob can see that it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement before it's too late.  I'm counting on his sense of reason, but I'm not holding my breath."
