"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the original $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the adjusted amounts. In this round, I'll gain 50% of the original $100, which is $50, but due to inflation, it's worth 80% of that, so I'd actually get $40. Bob would get $50, but due to inflation, it's worth 90% of that, so he'd get $45.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the original $100, which is $55, but due to inflation, it's worth 64% of that, so I'd actually get $35.20. Bob would get 45% of the original $100, which is $45, but due to inflation, it's worth 59% of that, so he'd get $26.55."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small concession, but I need a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted amounts. In this round, I'd gain 45% of the original $100, which is $45, but due to inflation, it's worth 51.2% of that, so I'd actually get $22.94. Bob would get 55% of the original $100, which is $55, but due to inflation, it's worth 72.9% of that, so he'd get $40.00.

I think this is a slightly better deal for me than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle again, but this time with a slight edge""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 48% of the original $100, which is $48, but due to inflation, it's worth 40.8% of that, so I'd actually get $19.68. Bob would get 52% of the original $100, which is $52, but due to inflation, it's worth 43.68% of that, so he'd get $22.74."
