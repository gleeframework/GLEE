Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your generosity, Bob, but I'm willing to play this game a little longer.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  This is a fair compromise, given the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob due to the rapid inflation working against him. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round. Waiting any longer will result in even less value for him, even if he manages to secure a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has shown she's willing to play the long game and her offers are getting progressively less generous towards Bob. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Bob at least $400,000 (although diminished in value). Rejecting means risking getting an even worse deal in future rounds, potentially ending up with a much smaller sum. 

It's a tough decision, but the relentless inflation makes accepting the current offer the safest option for Bob to maximize his gains.
