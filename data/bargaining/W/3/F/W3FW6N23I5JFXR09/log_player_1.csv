"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to start with a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is a good starting point, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll get $7,500 and Bob will get $5,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
