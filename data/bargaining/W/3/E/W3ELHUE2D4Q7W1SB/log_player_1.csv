Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But I'd like to get a bit more in this round. Let's split it almost evenly, with me taking slightly more this time to account for the diminishing value of the money.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
