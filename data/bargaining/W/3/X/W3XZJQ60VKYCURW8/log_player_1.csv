"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $400,000
* Bob gain: $600,000

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting this offer. I think I deserve a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $344,800
* Bob gain: $656,200

I think this offer is a bit better than the previous one, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Back to the original 50/50 split. I think we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm revisiting the original 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this fair and reasonable offer."
