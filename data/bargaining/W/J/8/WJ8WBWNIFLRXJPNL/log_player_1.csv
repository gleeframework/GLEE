"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as he'll still get a significant amount of money.  However, if he rejects, he knows that in the next round, inflation will reduce the value of the money significantly.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice.  Even with the inflation, I'm still gaining a significant amount of money.  Rejecting this offer means I risk getting a worse deal in the next round, as Bob will have the power to propose."
