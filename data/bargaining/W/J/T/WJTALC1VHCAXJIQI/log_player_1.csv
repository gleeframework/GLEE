"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a standard strategy in ultimatum games - offering the minimum possible amount to the other player, while still ensuring they are likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is a real concern, and accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
