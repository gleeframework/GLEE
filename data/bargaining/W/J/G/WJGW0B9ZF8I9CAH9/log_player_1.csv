"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the risk""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a small consolation prize to try to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I had initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I'll make a new offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the effects of inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
