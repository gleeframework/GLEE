"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and inviting Bob to make his next move."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to keep the majority. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather not give him a 60/40 split, especially with inflation eating away at my share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on my potential earnings, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly better deal to account for inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 35/65 split, especially considering the significant hit inflation has taken on my potential earnings. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down, I think I deserve more considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now. With the money I gain being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I need to be extremely cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 30/70 split, especially considering the significant hit inflation has taken on my potential earnings. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm running out of time and options."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode my potential earnings, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm not going to give up. Meet me at 38/62 or I'll walk away""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm trying to make a strong case for why I deserve a larger share, but I'm also leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
