"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I hope he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less, Bob's offer is still better than my previous offer, and it's a reasonable split. I'd rather take the 70 now than risk getting less in the next round."
