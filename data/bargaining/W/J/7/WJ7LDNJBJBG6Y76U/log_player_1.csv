Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 99 dollars for myself and giving 1 dollar to Bob. This is a very unequal split, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take 50 dollars than risk getting nothing.  A 50/50 split is fair, so I'll accept."
