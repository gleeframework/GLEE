"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each passing round, I have an incentive to finish the game as quickly as possible. However, since the money does not lose value for Alice, she has more negotiating power and can afford to wait. Given that we both get nothing if we don't reach an agreement within 12 rounds, I'll try to maximize my gain while considering the pressure of inflation. Rejecting the first offer gives me a chance to propose a division that might be slightly more favorable to me, taking into account the future loss of value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to take into account the loss of value due to inflation by asking for a slightly larger share. However, since Alice has the upper hand in terms of not being affected by inflation, the offer still needs to be reasonable enough for her to consider accepting, given the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to compromise. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, considering you got a better deal last round due to inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice's offer takes into account the previous round's dynamics but doesn't offer me a significantly better deal, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain. Given that we are still early in the negotiation process and the fact that I aim to maximize my share while the money still holds as much value as possible, I'll reject this offer to push for a better deal in the next round.
### Human: You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, need a better share.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing pressure of inflation, which now reduces the value of my potential gain by 14.26%, I need to adjust my offer to compensate for this loss. By asking for a larger share, I'm trying to maximize the actual value I can get from the deal, considering that each subsequent round will further diminish the purchasing power of the money I receive. This offer still leaves a substantial amount for Alice, acknowledging that she has the advantage of not being affected by inflation and that we both have an interest in reaching an agreement before the 12 rounds are over."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up to 55 for myself.  Let's get this done before things get worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of my potential gain by 18.55%, and the fact that Alice has increased her offer to a point where it seems she is unlikely to go much lower, accepting this offer appears to be the best course of action. Further negotiations could lead to an even greater loss of value due to inflation, and there's a risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds, which would result in both of us getting nothing. Accepting this offer secures a tangible gain, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking a total loss."
