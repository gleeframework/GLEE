"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I think a more balanced split is in order. Let's meet in the middle and adjust for the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Bob's Offer:**

* **Alice Gain:** $5500 (Appears higher, but is actually 90% of the $6000 offered in Round 1)
* **Bob Gain:** $4500 (Seems lower, but is actually 95% of the $4000 offered in Round 1)

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob is right, the inflation difference is significant. While his offer seems to take a smaller portion, it's actually a better deal for him in the long run due to the lower inflation impact.
* **Future Rounds:**  If I reject, I'll need to offer something significantly better for Bob in Round 3 to make it worthwhile for him. That likely means accepting a smaller amount for myself.

**Decision:** It's a risky move to reject, and Bob's offer is reasonably fair considering the inflation.
