"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round, I'm going to take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to take advantage of me. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a more cautious proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. No need to be greedy, let's make a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to balance out the previous offer and create a more even division."
