"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. We can negotiate further in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While it seems tempting to take $100,000 right now, the potential losses from inflation are too great. Alice is banking on Bob valuing immediate gains over long-term profit.  It's time to show Alice that Bob is here to play strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm offering you a deal that ensures you get a significant amount now. Consider the impact of inflation on both of us as we move forward.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Bob needs to establish himself as a serious contender. Offering Alice 35% of the initial sum is still a significant amount and positions Bob as willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of. 
* **Inflation Awareness:** The message emphasizes the ticking clock of inflation. Bob wants Alice to recognize that delaying a deal hurts both of them, though it hurts Bob more. This creates urgency without appearing desperate.
* **Future Leverage:** By aiming high in Round 2, Bob leaves room for concessions later. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still make smaller concessions in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a larger share than Alice's initial proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I still believe we can find a more equitable split. Let's try 450k for me and 550k for you.  We both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but this offer still isn't good enough for Bob. Let's analyze why:

* **Inflation Impact:** While Alice acknowledges the impact of inflation, she's still benefiting more from the delay. Even with a 45/55 split in her favor, her losses due to inflation are proportionally smaller than Bob's. 
* **Shift in Power:** Alice lowering her demand indicates that she recognizes Bob is serious about getting a fair share. Bob holds a stronger position now than he did in Round 1.
* **Long Game:**  Bob needs to show Alice that he's willing to play the long game and that he understands the value of each round. By rejecting this offer, he signals his commitment to securing a deal that reflects the actual impact of inflation on his potential earnings. 

**It's risky to decline, but the potential reward for a better deal in later rounds is worth it.**"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game, and we're both losing it. I'm holding firm at 60/40. It's a fair split that considers the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's close this deal and walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob shows flexibility by lowering his demand from 65% to 60%, indicating willingness to negotiate but also a firm stance on a favorable split. 
* **Emphasis on Shared Loss:** By reiterating the ""time is money"" concept, Bob reminds Alice that every round without a deal is a loss for both of them, reinforcing the urgency.
* **Simplified Split:** A clean 60/40 split is easy to understand and emphasizes the fairness Bob is aiming for. It presents a strong psychological anchor for Alice to consider.
* **Call to Action:** Bob directly proposes closing the deal, prompting Alice to seriously evaluate the offer in hand rather than gambling on potential future gains.

Bob is walking a tightrope here, but by balancing firmness with a degree of concession, he increases the chances of a favorable outcome."
