"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the clock is ticking on my share.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle, Bob? This deal saves us both time and keeps things amicable. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which works in my favor. Her offer is only slightly better than her first, and I'm willing to bet she'll crack under the pressure of her shrinking pot in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,

""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a fair offer, and it's only getting worse for you. Don't get greedy.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to move a bit. This is a compromise, let's close the deal and not risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is feeling the heat, but she's still overestimating her position. This offer is identical to the one she rejected in round 2! I need to hold strong, she'll likely fold soon if I stay firm."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,

""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest I can offer. Take it before inflation eats away any more of your share.""
