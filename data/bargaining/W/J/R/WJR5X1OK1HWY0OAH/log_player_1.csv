Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and your potential share is shrinking fast. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth 67.23% less than in the first round for me, and Bob's offer being relatively stable compared to previous rounds, I think it's the best decision to secure the remaining value. The offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Bob seems reasonable at this point, and I don't want to risk losing everything by pushing for further negotiations. Let's finalize the deal!"
