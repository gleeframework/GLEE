"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll give you the first move 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob gets to make the next move, I'll take this offer and see if I can do better next time.
