I'm going to try to get the majority of the money.  I'll start with a very uneven split and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  Bob is being greedy!  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll offer a more even split this time, but still keep a decent advantage.  Hopefully, Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
