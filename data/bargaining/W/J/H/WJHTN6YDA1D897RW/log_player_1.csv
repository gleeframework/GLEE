"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a decent share and can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my share of 50 would be $45 (50 * 0.9).

I'd like to reject this offer. I'd rather aim for a higher share. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my share of $45 from the previous round would be worth $40.50 in this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Accept and we can finalize!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is a bit more than the 50% Bob suggested earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going all the way to 60% 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the $100 is now worth $72.90.

Considering the offer, I'd be getting $45, which is worth $32.61 in this round. Bob would get $55, which is worth $39.99.

I'd like to accept this offer. It's a bit less than my previous ask, but it's a decent compromise.
