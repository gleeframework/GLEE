"Round 1

I'm not sure Alice understands how inflation will work in this game. I want to see if she'll adjust her offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we should both get a bigger share. This round, I'm taking a larger cut, but the value of money will decrease for you next round.  Let's see if we can find a more sustainable split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher share,  I think Alice has adjusted her offer to account for inflation and this is a fair compromise."
