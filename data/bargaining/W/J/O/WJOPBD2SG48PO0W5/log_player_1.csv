I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I want to secure a good chunk of the money while leaving Bob with something.  This seems like a good starting point to see if he'll be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being a bit greedy, but I'm not going to cave in just yet. I'll reject his offer and see what happens in the next round. There's still a lot of money at stake, and I want to make sure I get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to try to find a middle ground. Bob is obviously trying to get the better end of the deal, but I'm not willing to give in completely.  We're both losing money with each round, so hopefully this offer will be more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with a 50/50 split, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. The inflation is really taking its toll on Bob's share, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal later.  It's time to secure something before we both lose out completely."
