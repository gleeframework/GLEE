"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. You can try to do better if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted fair, I'll give you less, but I'll try to be more generous later 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 240,000, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is now worth 560,000.

I don't think I'm getting a good deal here. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You gave me less last round, so I'll try to give you a bit more this time. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting ripped off 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 233,400, and Bob's gain of 550,000 is now worth 286,400.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's slightly better than my previous gain. I'll accept this offer for now.
