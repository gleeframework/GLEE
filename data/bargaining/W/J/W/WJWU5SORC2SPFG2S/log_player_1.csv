"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the $100, and I'm giving you a slight advantage to make you more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts would be:

```
# Alice gain: 40
# Bob gain: 40
```

I accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
