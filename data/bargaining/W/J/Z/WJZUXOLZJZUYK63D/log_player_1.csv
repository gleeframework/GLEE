"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, but since the money is now worth 10% less, it's actually worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original amount. 

Bob's gain of $50 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth 0.95 of the original amount.

My decision is to reject this offer, as I prefer a higher share of the original amount.
