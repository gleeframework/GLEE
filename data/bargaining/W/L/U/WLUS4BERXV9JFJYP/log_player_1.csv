"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the money is worth more to me than it will be in future rounds due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'll take a little more this time, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's taking a bigger share, and considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal if we continue playing. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal.""}\n\nI'm making a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as the money is worth even less to him now. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not being too greedy, which might prompt Bob to reject the offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's settle this before the money shrinks even more. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable deal. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by continuing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to settle for $4800."
