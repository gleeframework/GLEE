"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, but I still have to make a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 54-46 split?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, hoping it's more acceptable to Bob."
