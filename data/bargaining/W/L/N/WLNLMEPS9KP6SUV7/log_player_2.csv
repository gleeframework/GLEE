"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can work out a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to settle for a 40/60 split.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be more even. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but we need to start moving towards a more balanced outcome.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. We're both losing money with each round, so it's best to find a solution quickly.  50/50 seems like the fairest way to do that. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable solution, especially considering the increasing inflation. It's better to secure something now than risk losing more in the coming rounds."
