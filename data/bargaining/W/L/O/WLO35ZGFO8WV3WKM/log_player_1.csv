"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor, since the money loses value faster for me.  But I'm open to negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this round, my gain of $4,000 is worth 90% of its original value, since it's 10% less due to inflation. So, I'd actually be getting $3,600.

Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of its original value, since it's 20% less due to inflation. So, he'd actually be getting $4,800.

Given this, I'd rather not accept the offer, since it's not as favorable to me as it was initially presented. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim for a more aggressive split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share now, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if you can do better next round!""
}
```

In this round, my gain of $7,000 is worth 70% of its original value, so I'd actually be getting $4,900."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. We're both losing money quickly, so a 50-50 split is the fairest option now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain of $5,000 is worth 50% of its original value, so I'd actually be getting $2,500.

Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 52% of its original value, so he'd actually be getting $5,200.

Given the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
