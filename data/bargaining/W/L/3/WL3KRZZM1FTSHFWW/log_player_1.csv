"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $480,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since it's not even a 50-50 split. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can end this game!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too greedy, considering the inflation is still eating away at the value of the money."

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $361,550, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth $443,750.

I'm not impressed with this offer, as it's still a relatively small share for me. I'm not going to accept it.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, but it's the best I've seen so far. I'm not sure if I should take it or try to negotiate further.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer.
