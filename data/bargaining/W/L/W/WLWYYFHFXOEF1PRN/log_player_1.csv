"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll give you a fair share""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4750 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation, so I'll assume it's still $5000.

I don't think splitting it evenly is a good idea for me, considering I'll be losing value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4750 is now worth 95% of what it was in the second round, so it's equivalent to $4502.50 in the second round's value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm willing to compromise""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a little more than last round. We both need to compromise to get something. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $7000 in the third round is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $5955 in the first round's value.

Bob's gain of $3000 in the third round is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2190 in the first round's value.

Bob's new offer is:

* Alice gain: $6000
* Bob gain: $4000

Considering the inflation, my gain of $6000 is worth 60% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $6000 in the first round's value.

I think this offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.
