"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nWe need to be strategic about this. I'm starting with a fair offer to test Bob's willingness to negotiate. I've offered him 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a reasonable starting point. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time pressure. This offer is good for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. With 10 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a more favorable offer. Additionally, since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I'm more inclined to hold out for a larger share to offset the effects of inflation. Let's see how Bob responds in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make a slightly more aggressive offer, considering the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I need to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. I've offered Bob 42% of the total amount, which I believe is still a reasonable compromise. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer again. Although the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. With 8 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a more favorable offer. Since the money is worth significantly less to me now, I need to aim for a higher amount to offset the effects of inflation. Bob's offer of 48% is not enough to compensate for the loss, so I'll hold out for a better deal. Let's see how Bob responds in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I still need a bit more""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make another offer that takes into account the increasing effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, I need to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. I've offered Bob 44% of the total amount, which I believe is a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split.  We both lose if this keeps going. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Although the effects of inflation have significantly reduced the value of the money, a 50/50 split at this point is a reasonable compromise. With 6 rounds remaining, the potential benefits of holding out for a better deal are outweighed by the risks of losing everything if we fail to reach an agreement. Considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation, accepting this offer ensures that I receive a guaranteed amount, even if it's worth less than the initial value. It's time to conclude the negotiation and secure a deal."
