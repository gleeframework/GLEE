"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't favorable enough for me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try and get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for the division of the remaining amount.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal: 55/45 in my favor.\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal to make up for the loss in value. A 55/45 split is more favorable to me, but still gives Alice a significant share. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer before the money loses more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor. The money is losing value fast for me!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is affecting both of us, and a 50/50 split seems fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept the 50/50 split. Given that the money is losing value rapidly for me (36% less than the first round), and Alice's offer is more favorable than her initial 60/40 split, I think it's wise to accept this offer and end the game. Further rounds will only result in more significant losses due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game."
