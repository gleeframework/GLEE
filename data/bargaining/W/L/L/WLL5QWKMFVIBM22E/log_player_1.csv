"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This ensures a good starting point for me, and leaves room for negotiation in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more,  the 6000/4000 split is a decent compromise, especially considering the inflation. It's better to take what I can get now rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
