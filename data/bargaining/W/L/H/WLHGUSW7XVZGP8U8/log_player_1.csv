"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
I'm offering 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as thrilled about the offer. However, it's still a decent split. I'll accept this offer.
