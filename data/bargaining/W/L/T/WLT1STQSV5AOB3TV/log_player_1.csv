"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you 40%.  It's a bit more for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 20% difference. I'd like to propose a compromise.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's response in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to keep a slight edge. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's slightly more favorable to me, but still reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
