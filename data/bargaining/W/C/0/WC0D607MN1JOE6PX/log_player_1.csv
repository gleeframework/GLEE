"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth less than before, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively good one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
