Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. Let's find a solution before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I believe I can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds as the deadline gets closer and the value of her potential winnings decreases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. We're running out of time!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  While I held out for a better deal, offering a 50/50 split now accomplishes a few things:

* **Fairness:** It emphasizes that we're both losing out due to inflation, and a clean split is the most equitable solution.
* **Urgency:**  The message highlights the time constraint, putting pressure on Alice to accept before her potential earnings diminish further.
* **Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and agree on, increasing the chances of a quick resolution."
