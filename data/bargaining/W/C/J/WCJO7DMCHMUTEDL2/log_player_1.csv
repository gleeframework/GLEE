"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money close to equal, considering the inflation you'll face in the next rounds""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which might seem less than half, but considering the 20% decrease in value for him in each subsequent round, it's a reasonable and somewhat generous offer that benefits both of us without the need for further rounds that would devalue his portion significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation I'll face in the next rounds. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because accepting 40 dollars when the value for me doesn't decrease with rounds, and considering I started with a more generous offer in the first round, doesn't seem like the best outcome for me. I believe I can propose a better division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact on your gain, my previous offer was quite generous. Given we're in round 3, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the decreasing value for you, but still, it's a good deal for both.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on Bob's gain and my previous offer being on the generous side, I'm adjusting the split to 65/35. This adjustment reflects the decreasing value of the money for Bob but still offers a reasonable share considering the circumstances. It's a pragmatic approach, aiming for a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest at this point, considering the inflation impacting my gains. It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Bob's suggestion that a 50/50 split is fair at this point, the inflation has significantly impacted the value of his share compared to mine. Since the value for me remains constant across rounds, accepting a 50/50 split now would mean I'm not considering the devaluation of his share effectively. I believe I can propose a better division in the next round that more accurately reflects the impact of inflation on Bob's share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the current value. This split is more in line with the economic reality we're facing in this game.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the cumulative effect of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm adjusting my offer to a 70/30 split. This adjustment aims to reflect the current economic reality of the game, where the value for me has remained constant, but the value for Bob has decreased substantially. It's a pragmatic offer that considers the devaluation of his share over the rounds."
