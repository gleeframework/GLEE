"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, knowing that Bob's money will depreciate much faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is much lower than my original offer, and I know he's losing value more quickly than I am. I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a high share, but I've lowered my offer slightly to account for the inflation factor. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept this, as he's losing value rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still significantly more than what I would earn if we continue to the next round.  I'm losing value much faster than Bob, and this offer is my best chance at getting a reasonable amount of money."
