I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. I'll keep 90% of the money, but I'm aware of the inflation, so I'm giving Bob a decent share to avoid potential conflict in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy, and I'm not going to be taken advantage of. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm confident I can get a more fair deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me.  I think a fair split is the best way to ensure a quick and amicable resolution."
