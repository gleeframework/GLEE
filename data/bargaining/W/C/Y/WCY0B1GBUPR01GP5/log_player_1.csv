"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is equal, it's a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
