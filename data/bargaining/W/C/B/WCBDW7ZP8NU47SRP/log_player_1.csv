Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $30 is now worth less than I initially thought.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
