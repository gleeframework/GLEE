"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more fairly, I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair share, but remember time is working against me. I'll take $55, you take $45.  This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Time is on my side. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, I still have some leverage.  Bob clearly believes I'm more desperate than I am.  I need to demonstrate I'm willing to risk it all to get a reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob. Let's stop wasting time.  We'll split it 50/50. Take it or leave it. This is truly my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to play hardball. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating I'm willing to walk away. The decreasing value of the money for me makes each round riskier, but Bob doesn't seem to realize the pressure is actually on him too.  He risks getting nothing if I refuse to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You should have taken my previous offers. Now it's my turn to be firm. 60/40 is the new deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but I need to cut my losses. Bob is clearly willing to play hardball, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Accepting $40 now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
