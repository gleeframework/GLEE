"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, I'm leaving a decent amount for Bob, but still getting the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not sure if this is the best option. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2 for me, and 5% less than in round 2 for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight majority for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer to get some cash now.
