"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm fair!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to start the game on a positive note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it fairly, I'll take a bit more this time since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a good chunk, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm getting a fair deal, I'd like to make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

I'll offer to take $3,600 (which is 36% of the original $10,000) and leave $6,400 for Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
