Do you accept this offer?","Considering the impact of inflation, I'd rather not take the hit. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'd rather not take a 50-50 split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.
