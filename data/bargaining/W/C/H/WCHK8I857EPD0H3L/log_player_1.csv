"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, as I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of losing more money due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the previous round, and I have more leverage now that I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still offering a majority share to myself, but I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation and encourage Bob to accept before the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still not ideal, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for both of us. Accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation and ending up with an even smaller share in the next round."
