"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair split, with each of us getting $50. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount of money, and we don't have to worry about going to the next round. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining money. With inflation, the money is worth less and less each round, so I'd rather wait and try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining money, which is a bit more generous than his previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. I'll take 58, you can have 42. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up that much more to Bob. I think I can do better than 42% of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the further inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a higher share, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 60% of the remaining money, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
