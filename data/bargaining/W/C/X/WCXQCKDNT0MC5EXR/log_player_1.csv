Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While the pressure from inflation is mounting, Bob is still pushing for a significantly larger share. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to the potential gains if we reach a more equitable split in later rounds.  It's a risk, but I believe holding out for a better offer is still the right move."
