"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent amount, I'm hoping for more, and there are plenty of rounds left to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I know Alice may not be happy with this, I believe it's a fair starting point considering the diminishing value of the money with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is better than her first, I still believe I can get a better deal. The money is losing value quickly, and I need to maximize my gains before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 70/30. I'm hoping this shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal done, while still being fair. We are losing a lot of value with each round, and I need to secure a sizable amount before it's too late."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, but the inflation is starting to hit hard. I'm going to try and see if I can get her to come up just a little bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 75/25.  This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to offer. Alice has rejected my last two offers and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough decision. While I wanted a better deal, the value of the money is dropping rapidly. Accepting this 50/50 split ensures I get at least something substantial before the inflation completely erodes the value of the money."
