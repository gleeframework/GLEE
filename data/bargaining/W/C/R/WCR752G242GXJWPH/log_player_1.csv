"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the initiative to make the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split in my favor. This is a compromise, recognizing that my previous offer was rejected. I believe it's a fair offer considering the inflation that has occurred."

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split in my favor. This is a further compromise, as I recognize that both of our previous offers were rejected. We are now facing significant inflation, so I believe a more balanced offer is necessary to reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

We're approaching the halfway point, and the inflation is getting serious. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as I believe it's the most logical way to ensure we both receive something, given the significant loss in value.  This is a fair and balanced offer considering the rapidly declining value of our potential earnings."
