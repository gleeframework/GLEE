"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'll think carefully... If I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round. Bob will get $5,000, which is worth 90% of what he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll take the offer.
