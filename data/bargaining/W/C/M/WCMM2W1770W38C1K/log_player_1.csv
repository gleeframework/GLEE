Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation makes this offer appealing.  It's a fair split, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
