"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a decent base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, no negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as it's not as generous as I had hoped. Additionally, I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob, so I'm not sure if the split is truly equal. I'd like to propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the 60-40 split, still a fair deal""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that still favors me slightly, but is still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40-60 split, as it's a significant departure from my original proposal. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate further and find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the 52-48 split, still a reasonable compromise""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, where I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, while still giving me a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with the 30-70 split, as it's a drastic departure from my original proposal. The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I'd like to try to negotiate further and find a more equitable solution."

{""alice_gain"": 3800, ""bob_gain"": 6200, ""message"": ""A last-ditch effort to find a compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 38-62 split, where I get $3,800 and Bob gets $6,200. I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, while still giving me a slightly better deal. This is my final offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
