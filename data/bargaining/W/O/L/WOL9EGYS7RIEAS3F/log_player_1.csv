"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is a 45/55 split, which is a bit too lopsided for my taste.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm proposing a 48/52 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant impact of inflation on the money's value, I'm looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is a 47/53 split, which is still a bit too lopsided for my taste.

I'll try to negotiate again, hoping to get a more balanced split. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money's value continuing to decrease due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split again, hoping that Bob will finally accept a more balanced deal."
