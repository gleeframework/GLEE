"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm proposing a 990,000/10,000 split.  While it may seem unfair, this gives Bob a small amount to start with and allows me to maximize my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant increase from his initial offer, my share is still only 200,000. I believe I can do better by continuing the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing an 800,000/200,000 split.  This offer is significantly more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, and while it's a smaller gain than my initial proposal, it's still a good chunk of money.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  My share is still significantly less than my initial goal, but with the increasing inflation, it's unlikely I can get a better deal in the next round.  This offer provides a reasonable gain, and it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
