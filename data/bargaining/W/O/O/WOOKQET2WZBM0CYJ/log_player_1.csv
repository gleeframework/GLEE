"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it also gives Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept.  It's a bit risky, but since the money loses value with each round, I want to secure a large portion as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is more equitable than the first one, it still gives Bob the majority of the money. I can hold out for a better deal. With each passing round, the value of the money I receive decreases, but it also decreases the value of the money Bob receives, making him more likely to accept a less favorable offer in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but I'm also giving Bob a more substantial amount.  This is a compromise that balances my desire to secure a large portion of the money while also acknowledging that Bob's share is worth more with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfavorable. Even though the value of the money I would receive is significantly reduced due to inflation, I can still hold out for a better deal. The longer we go, the more the value of Bob's share decreases, increasing the likelihood of a better offer from him in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. This offer is a compromise that recognizes the decreasing value of my share while still offering Bob a sizable portion. I believe this could be a good point to reach a compromise, as we are nearing the halfway point of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly, Bob's offer is still too unfavorable. I'm determined to get a larger share of the money, and I believe that with each passing round, the pressure on Bob will increase, leading to a more favorable offer for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With the inflation rapidly eroding the value of the money, I propose an equal split. This is a fair and reasonable solution given the circumstances. We are both nearing the halfway point of the game, and the risk of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real. An even split allows us both to secure a decent amount of money, even with the inflated value."
