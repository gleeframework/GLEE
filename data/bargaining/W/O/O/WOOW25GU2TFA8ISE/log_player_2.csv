"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem generous, but remember, with each round, the value of money decreases. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60:40 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk and aiming for a fair division, I propose a 50:50 split. This maintains equity while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
