I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's getting late in the game and the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer means I get at least something, and with only 10 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal."
