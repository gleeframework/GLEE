Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this time. 50/50 seems fair, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, accepting this offer seems like the best option."
