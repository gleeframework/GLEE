Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I took into account the inflation, let's settle this 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
## Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice.  Every round makes a significant difference.
* **Alice's Offer:** Although Alice is still getting a slightly better deal, it's important to remember that her potential gains are diminishing at a much faster rate than Bob's. Accepting 42 now might be better than risking an even lower offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Bob can secure a better deal in future rounds. Alice might propose an even less favorable split, putting Bob in a worse position. 

In essence, it's better for Bob to secure a decent amount now than to risk getting a much lower amount later due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
