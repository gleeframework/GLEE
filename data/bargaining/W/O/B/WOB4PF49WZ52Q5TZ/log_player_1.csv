I'm going for a slightly unfair but still generous split in the first round. I want to see if Bob is greedy or if he's willing to settle for a small amount to get something at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is playing a very aggressive game, but I'm not giving in so easily.  I will make a counter-offer in the next round.  I believe I can get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and I believe Bob will realize that after his last aggressive move.  We are now at round 3, and the money is shrinking quickly, so it's in both our best interests to come to an agreement."
