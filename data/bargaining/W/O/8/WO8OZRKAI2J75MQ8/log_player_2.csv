"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $40, it's only the first round.  Since the money will be worth less with each passing round, it's better to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than your offer. This is a fair split, and we can avoid the risk of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While the offer is better than the first round, it's still not the best possible outcome. I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's finalize this before it gets worse.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, it's time to accept a reasonable offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is slightly better than the previous round, it's still not a fair deal considering the rapid inflation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better split.  The longer we wait, the worse the deal becomes for me, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm still confident we can find a better solution than your last offer. This is a fair compromise given the inflation, and we can avoid losing more money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting your share, don't wait any longer 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with the offer. While inflation is indeed a significant factor, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can improve the split. This is a critical point in the game, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we're both losing money. This is the best deal we can make to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's be reasonable and finalize this split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing over half the value, stop waiting and accept this 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a difficult choice, but I have to accept. The inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains, and the risk of getting nothing is too high. While I'm not happy with the split, it's the best I can do at this point."
