"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 60 dollars and Bob will get 40 dollars. The message is just a friendly offer, trying to establish a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering the offer, I'll...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 70-30 split, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground between the initial 60-40 split and Bob's 70-30 offer. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering the offer, I'll...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer because the 75-25 split is a significant improvement from the previous offers. Although the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, the value of the money Bob gains is significantly lower due to inflation. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
