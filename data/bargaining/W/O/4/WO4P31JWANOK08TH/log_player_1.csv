Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 300,000 gain. It's a significant difference from the initial 50/50 split. I'm willing to negotiate further.
