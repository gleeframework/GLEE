"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on or if he'll try to bargain for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a lot closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to a more even distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm still aiming for a bigger share, but acknowledging Bob's potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally a 50/50 split, and while the value of the money has decreased, it's still better than risking further rounds and ending up with nothing."
