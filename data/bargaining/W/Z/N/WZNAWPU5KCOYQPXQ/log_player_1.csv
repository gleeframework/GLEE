"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. This way, I get $80, which is also 80% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $38. Since Bob's gain of $60 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $54, I think I can do better than this.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more now.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking 60% of the remaining $100, which is worth 95% of the original amount, or $95. Bob gets 40%, which is worth 90% of the original amount, or $54."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 5 points, let's see if you can meet me there. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $45 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $90. Bob's gain of $55 is worth 85.5% of the original amount, which is $85.5.

I think I can do better than this offer. I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the remaining inflation.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at 45, but I think I deserve a bit more to make up for the losses.""
