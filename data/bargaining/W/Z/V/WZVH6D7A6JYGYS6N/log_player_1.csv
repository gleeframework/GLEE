"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  It's likely Bob will reject this, but we'll see!  Let's see what he proposes in return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, even taking into account inflation.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 70%, but still leaving a significant gap for Bob. I believe he'll recognize the potential for a more even split in the future if he keeps rejecting my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has made my potential earnings significantly less than in the first round, Bob's offer is still more favorable than the 50/50 split I would get in the next round if I reject his offer.  There's a chance that I could get a better offer in the future, but the risk of inflation making my potential earnings even lower is too great.  It's better to take this deal and secure at least 40% of the remaining value."
