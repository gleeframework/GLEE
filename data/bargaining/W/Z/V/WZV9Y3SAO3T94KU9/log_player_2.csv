"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 90% and leave you 10%.  Fair enough, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it seems tempting to take $1000 right now, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. How about a 60/40 split?  It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share.  70/30 seems fair given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but 30% is still too low for me, especially with the inflation working against me. I need to counter with an offer that incentivizes her to take the deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal.  I'm taking a smaller cut to give you a good share. But let's close this before inflation eats away at our potential gains!""
