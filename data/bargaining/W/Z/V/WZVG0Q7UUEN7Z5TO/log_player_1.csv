"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal if you accept now.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, that seems fair, no? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 84% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting it evenly, considering I was initially willing to give Bob 300,000. Now, with the reduced value of the money, I'd rather get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a decent share.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation."
