"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, while still leaving Bob with something. Since the money depreciates more for Bob, I believe this is a fair offer that he might accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm getting significantly less than my initial offer, the money is rapidly depreciating. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and any further negotiation will only reduce my share further due to inflation."
