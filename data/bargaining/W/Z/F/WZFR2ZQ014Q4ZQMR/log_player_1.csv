"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 75:25. This might seem a bit lopsided, but considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds, it could be beneficial for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself. This way, we can still make a profit despite the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
