"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I figure a large initial offer might incentivize Bob to accept quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is a good deal considering the inflation.  I'm not sure how much Bob knows about the inflation rates, but he clearly has a different understanding of its effects. I'll take what I can get at this point."
