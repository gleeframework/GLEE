# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's end this. It's only getting worse for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I'm making it simple - a 50/50 split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer. Now I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's getting dangerous to keep rejecting. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Bob. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows Bob is facing inflation.  She's likely to keep pushing for a slightly better deal each round.

While not ideal, accepting 43 (which is worth significantly less than it was initially) is better than risking getting a worse offer or reaching a point where any potential gain is negligible due to inflation."
