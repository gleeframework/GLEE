Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not budging that much. I'll meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. 58% for me, 42% for you is still a good deal considering the circumstances.

# Alice gain: 580000
