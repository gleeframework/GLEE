"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation penalty you'll face if we delay.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I've included a message to remind Bob that the value of the money decreases by 5% for him with each passing round, so it's in his best interest to accept a reasonable offer early on. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn -  let's settle this quickly. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 610000,
  ""bob_gain"": 390000,
  ""message"": ""You didn't take my previous offer, and now the inflation is working against you. I've adjusted my offer accordingly.""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, considering that the inflation penalty is affecting Bob's potential gain. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking and the value is decreasing. Let's meet in the middle with this offer and end this. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000,
  ""message"": ""You're losing value with each passing round, and I'm not feeling the pressure. My offer reflects this reality.""
}
```

I've increased my share again, as the inflation penalty continues to erode the value of Bob's potential gain. I'm trying to drive home the point that it's in his best interest to accept a deal sooner rather than later. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I understand your frustration, but the math is clear: each round costs you more than it costs me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, as the inflation penalty continues to mount for Bob. I'm also trying to convey that I'm willing to take a hard line and walk away if I don't get an offer that I like. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm making one last attempt to reach a reasonable agreement. This offer is my bottom line - let's be sensible and avoid a total loss. 
# Alice gain: 570000 
# Bob gain: 430000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I've been consistent in my approach, and the inflation penalty is only getting worse for you. This is my most generous offer yet, considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but trying to frame it as a ""generous"" offer given the significant inflation penalty that Bob is facing. I'm trying to make it clear that I'm not going to back down, and that Bob should take this offer if he wants to avoid a total loss. Let me know what Bob decides!"
