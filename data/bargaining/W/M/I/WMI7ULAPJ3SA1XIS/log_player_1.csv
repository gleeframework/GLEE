"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a better deal next time, I promise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not buying Bob's promise of a better deal next time. I'd rather take the better offer now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
