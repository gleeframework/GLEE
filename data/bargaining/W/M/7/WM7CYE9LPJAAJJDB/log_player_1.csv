"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob 600,000 and keeping 400,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not a bad deal, and I'll take the 300,000.
