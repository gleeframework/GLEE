"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a slightly larger share to start.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share to start, but still keeping a majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob. I'm offering you a bigger share, but don't expect me to give away the whole pie.""
}
```"
