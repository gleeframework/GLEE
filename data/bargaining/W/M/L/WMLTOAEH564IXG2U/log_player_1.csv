"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get a good starting point and secure a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a dramatic decrease in my share. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my initial proposal slightly, but still aiming for a majority share.  I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation effect and the possibility of getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still less than what I initially proposed, the inflation is starting to take a significant toll. It's risky to continue rejecting offers, and 550,000 is still a substantial amount of money, even after the inflation.  It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing later."
