"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and reasonable, 60% for me and 40% for you is a good starting point.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but 60/40 feels a bit lopsided."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  It's a good starting point for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58% for me and 42% for you is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a more even split. I'm willing to negotiate further, but 58/42 doesn't seem like enough of a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's try 52/48.  It's a small adjustment, but it brings us closer to a more equal split.  What do you think?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, 56% for me and 44% for you is as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, and the value of the money is dropping fast.  While I'd prefer a more even split, 56/44 is the best I can likely get at this point."
