"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, knowing that inflation will decrease the value of the money over time.  I'm giving Bob a small portion to make it seem like a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is drastically worse than my initial offer, and I have a lot of time left to negotiate. I'm hoping he will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm adjusting my proposal to be more appealing, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a substantial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I have a lot of rounds left. I will continue to hold out for a larger share of the money.  I will propose a higher offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm making another slight reduction to my offer, but I'm still confident I can secure a large share.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and he'll be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, even with the inflation impacting the money. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with the remaining rounds. I will propose a slightly lower offer than before, hoping to nudge Bob closer to a fair agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm further reducing my offer, but I believe this is still a reasonable split, especially considering the rapid inflation rate. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and he will accept this offer to avoid losing out on more potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit better than his previous offers, it's still not a fair split.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share of the money, especially since we have several rounds left and the value of the money is quickly depreciating.  I believe I can still secure a better deal by proposing a slightly lower offer than before."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am reducing my offer again, but I believe this is still a reasonable split, especially considering the rapid inflation rate and the dwindling number of rounds remaining. I hope Bob will finally recognize the value of the money is decreasing rapidly and accept this offer to avoid losing out on more potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is close to what I would have proposed in the next round. The inflation is significant, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent share of the money."
