"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to maintain a decent share for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now. I'll calculate the actual amount Bob is offering in terms of the original $10,000.

Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, that means his offer of $5200 is equivalent to $5200 / (1 - 0.488) = $5200 / 0.512 = $10,117.1875 in the first round.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer.
