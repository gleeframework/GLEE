I'm going to be greedy and take a big chunk of the money.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept this since it's still a decent amount for him, and I don't want to risk him taking a larger share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than nothing, Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try and grab a huge chunk of the money.  I'm hoping that I can get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to give in to his demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  Bob is being greedy, so I'm going to try to hold firm and take a larger share.  This might be a good compromise, as he'll get a decent amount, and it'll be a better offer than what he proposed."
