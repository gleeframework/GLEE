**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her but are still not in my favor.  I need to hold strong and signal I'm willing to risk it all to get a better deal.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation disparity benefits me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is the same offer you just gave me, but flipped. It's clear we're both feeling the pressure. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning Point:** Round 6 is crucial. We're past the halfway point, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of her faster depreciation. 
* **Mirroring:** By mirroring her previous offer, I'm highlighting the absurdity of the situation and putting the ball firmly in her court. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need for a quick resolution before inflation eats away at the value of any potential deal.
* **Slight Edge:**  While this offer slightly favors me, it's close enough to her previous offer that it might be tempting for her to accept, especially with the looming deadline."
