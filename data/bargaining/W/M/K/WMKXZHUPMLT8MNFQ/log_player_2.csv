Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","It seems there was a mistake in the previous message. I had actually accepted Alice's offer in Round 9, not rejected it in Round 7. Since I accepted the offer, the game should be over. However, I'll respond as if the game is still ongoing.

If I were to send a new offer, I would try to take advantage of Alice's desperation due to the inflation. Here it is:
{""bob_gain"": 80,
""alice_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""Considering the massive inflation hit you're taking, I think 80-20 is a reasonable deal. You're still getting something, and I'm taking on the risk of further negotiations.""}

Please let me know if the game is indeed still ongoing or if it's over due to my previous acceptance."
