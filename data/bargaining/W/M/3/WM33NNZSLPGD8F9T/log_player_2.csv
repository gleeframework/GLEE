"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and avoid the inflation trap! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for my turn to make a proposal. With inflation affecting Alice more than me, I think I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share since you're more affected by inflation""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice is more affected by inflation, I'll take advantage of this and propose a division that favors me more. I'm willing to take 60% of the money, leaving Alice with 40%. My message to Alice is a simple explanation of my reasoning, highlighting the impact of inflation on her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting smaller with each round. It's in our best interest to settle this now. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice's share is still too high, and the impact of inflation on her gain is significant. Since my gain isn't affected by inflation, I can afford to wait for a better offer or make another proposal that benefits me more. Alice's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced this is her final offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on your share, it's time to settle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share, I'll make an offer that takes advantage of this situation. I'll propose a 70-30 split in my favor, explaining to Alice that the decreasing value of her share due to inflation should motivate her to accept this offer and settle the game. The message is direct and emphasizes the effect of inflation to persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's be realistic.  I'm offering you 400,000 - a fair deal considering the circumstances. If you refuse, we both risk leaving with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's message framing it as a fair deal, the numbers still favor her too much. The impact of inflation on her gain is substantial, and I believe she's more motivated to settle than I am. Since my gain isn't affected by inflation, I can afford to wait for a better offer or make another proposal that benefits me more. Alice's threat of both of us leaving with nothing seems empty, given her share's decreasing value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Inflation is crippling your share, it's time to accept the inevitable""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share, which is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I'll make an offer that reflects this reality. I'll propose an 80-20 split in my favor, emphasizing to Alice that the rapidly decreasing value of her share due to inflation leaves her little choice but to accept this offer. The message is blunt, highlighting the inevitability of her situation to persuade her to settle."
