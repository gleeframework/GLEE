"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but it's important to start with a fair offer to see Bob's reaction.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a smaller share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair! He wants to keep 9000 while giving me only 1000. Even with the inflation, I'm not accepting this. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation effect on my gains. I think it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and wants to keep a larger share.  I'm still losing money due to inflation, but I'll keep fighting for a better deal.  This offer is still unfair, considering the inflation effect on my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. Even with inflation, a fair split is the best chance we have of reaching an agreement. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
