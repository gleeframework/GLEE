"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good share. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than mine was, but I'm not sure he's taking inflation into account. I'm going to reject and see if he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

Okay, I'm going to take inflation into account this time. I'm offering 75 for myself, knowing that it's equivalent to 90 in the first round due to inflation. I hope Bob is more willing to negotiate now!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, Bob's offer is starting to look pretty good. I'm not sure if he's factoring in inflation correctly, but I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round. I'll take it!"
