```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the new total is $900,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer since I'm not getting a good deal. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.
