"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value I'll get from this offer.

For the 30 dollars I'll get, its actual value after inflation is 30 * 0.95 = 28.5 dollars.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
