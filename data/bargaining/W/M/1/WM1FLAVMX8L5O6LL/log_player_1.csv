"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better one. I'll accept Bob's offer.
