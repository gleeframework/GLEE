"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn. How about this slightly adjusted split? It accounts for the time value of money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share remains the same, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than before 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal.  We should split it evenly to avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Inflation isn't affecting me, after all 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that inflation doesn't affect her, it severely impacts me. Accepting 43 dollars now is worth significantly less than it was in round 1. I need to push for a more agreeable split considering the time pressure and the shrinking value of my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is really eating into your share, isn't it? 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The game has reached a critical point. While 41 dollars is significantly less than what I aimed for initially, rejecting this offer carries a massive risk. The value of my potential gain diminishes rapidly with each round. If I reject this and don't secure a better deal in the next round or two, I risk ending up with nothing. It's a tough choice, but accepting this offer guarantees a gain, even if smaller than desired."
