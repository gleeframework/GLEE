"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather have more, but I'll think about it...""
}
```

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best deal for me. I'll think about it and come up with a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm keeping 550,000$ for myself."
