"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 32$ (80% of 40). I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me less than what I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in!

My gain of 25$ is actually worth 16.8$ (48.8% of 35, which is 80% of 25). Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm willing to accept this offer to get some money rather than risking further inflation.
