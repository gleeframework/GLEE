"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

I'll think about it...

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
