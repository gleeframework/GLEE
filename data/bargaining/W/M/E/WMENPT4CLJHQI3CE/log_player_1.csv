"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see why this is a good move. Bob's offer is getting closer to fair, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation working against him.  We can likely secure a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a very generous offer considering the inflation!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are reflecting that.  While he claims this is his bottom line, the inflation is steadily eroding his potential gains. We're in a strong position to push for an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""This is your last chance, Bob. The deal is getting worse with every passing round!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're pushing the advantage here. Bob is running out of time, and his potential gains are shrinking rapidly. By offering a slightly better deal than last time, we're applying pressure while still aiming for a significant majority of the money."
