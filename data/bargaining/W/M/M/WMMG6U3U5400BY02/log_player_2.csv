Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Declining value:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting longer means Bob will receive even less in future rounds, even if he manages to secure a slightly better split.
* **Alice's offer:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split. She likely realizes the money's declining value and is becoming more willing to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of a better deal in Round 4 is incredibly risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a more favorable split, and the value will decrease further.

Bob needs to cut his losses and accept a reasonable offer while it's still on the table."
