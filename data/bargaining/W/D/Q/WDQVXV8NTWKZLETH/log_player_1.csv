I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,900, which is more than he got in the previous round, even after the inflation discount.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, and I'm still keeping a good chunk of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even with the inflation discount, I can do better than $2000. I'm going to hold out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}

I'm trying to keep the offer competitive with the previous round, but still get a good share. The inflation is starting to affect me, but I'm hoping Bob realizes that he can get a better deal than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  The inflation is really starting to hit, but I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}

The inflation is getting out of control, but I'm hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure too. I'm offering him a slightly larger share than in the previous round."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for more. The inflation is hurting me, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096} 
```

With inflation hitting hard, I need to start accepting more reasonable offers.  This offer gives Bob a significant share, but I'm still getting a decent amount.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise at this point."
