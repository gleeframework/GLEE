Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy with the 55-45 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'll have to adjust my thinking.
