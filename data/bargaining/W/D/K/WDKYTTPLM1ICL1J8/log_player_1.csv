"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. Since the money loses value faster for you, it makes sense to get as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to take 5000 now than risk getting nothing at the end! The money is depreciating fast, and it's unclear if I can get a better offer later."
