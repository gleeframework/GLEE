"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time.  Let's get this done.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that last offer was a bit too low for me. Let's try this - it's closer to my original suggestion. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the value keeps decreasing. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's get serious.  The clock is ticking. This is my counter offer - it's the same ratio as yours, just flipped. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round. Waiting longer means he'll get even less.
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice has consistently offered deals where she gets more than Bob. Her latest offer is a ""counter-offer"" mirroring Bob's previous proposal but with the amounts flipped.  This suggests she's unlikely to offer anything significantly better for Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While getting $40 isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing if they fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 

By accepting now, Bob cuts his losses from inflation and secures a reasonable amount, even if it's less than half."
