"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 2000$ is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 1900$.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I think I'll accept it this time. At least I'll get something.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
