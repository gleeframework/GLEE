"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair chance to counter""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself. My message is a hint that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also setting a relatively low bar for Bob to counter."
