"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  I think this is a fair deal considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 40

Do you accept this offer?","{
