Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I take a large share, but I still give Bob a decent amount. Hopefully, he'll accept, and we can both get some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers is too high.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than getting nothing."
