I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob responds. I'll keep in mind the inflation factor, but also want to try to get this game over quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable to me.  Even though the inflation rate is higher for me, I'd rather take the chance to make my own offer in the next round. I can still gain significantly more than $1000, especially with Bob's smaller inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8000 for me and 2000 for Bob.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to Bob, especially since he's experienced less inflation than me.  I'm still aiming for a quick resolution, but I need to account for the fact that he might be more inclined to reject a highly lopsided offer this time around."
