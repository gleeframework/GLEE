Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to keep things simple, Bob. How about a 52/48 split? It's closer to your offer while still acknowledging the time value of money.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split. Take it before inflation eats away at any potential gains for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is making concessions, even if they're small.  I'm aiming to get at least a 51/49 split in my favor. With each round, her position weakens, and mine doesn't."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 515000,
""alice_gain"": 485000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm offering a 51.5/48.5 split. This is your chance to secure a decent share before inflation takes another bite."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice.  She's aware the longer this goes on, the less favorable the outcome for her. By offering a slightly better deal than before, I'm hoping she sees it as a reasonable compromise before the difference in our positions becomes even more extreme."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, you win.  Let's split it 50/50 before we both lose too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally willing to accept a 50/50 split. While I was holding out for a slightly better deal, the longer this goes on, the higher the risk of getting nothing. Accepting now guarantees a fair share and avoids the potential loss of the entire amount due to continued inflation for Alice."
