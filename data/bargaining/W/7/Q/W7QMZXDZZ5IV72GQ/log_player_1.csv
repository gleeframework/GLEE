"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can build on this!""}

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself, which is a 90% share. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see if we can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split. I think we can both do better than Alice's offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent amount, especially since the value of money is decreasing over time. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
