"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'll get the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll get $50, which is worth 5% less than the $80 I was initially offered, but it's a fair split. I'll accept this offer.
