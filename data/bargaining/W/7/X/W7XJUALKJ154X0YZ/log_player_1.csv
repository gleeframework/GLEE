"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the inflation factor. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully.

After considering the proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! 

Let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money in the current round.

After calculating the effective values, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
