"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get 10%, I'll take 90%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 10% is something, it's not a good starting point considering the inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split this more evenly.  I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  That's a fairer deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  How about I take 70% and you get 30%?  We're already losing money, let's avoid more losses. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd still prefer a more even split, we're already losing money. Accepting this offer ensures I get something and prevents further losses from inflation."
