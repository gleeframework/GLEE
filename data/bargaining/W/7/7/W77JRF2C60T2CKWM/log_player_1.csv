This is a classic game theory problem. My offer reflects a strategy that prioritizes getting a deal in the first round. I'm offering Bob a decent share (40%), hoping he'll accept it.  If he rejects, there's a risk the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have gotten more in the first round, the inflation is a serious factor.  Bob's offer, while not ideal, is at least a 50/50 split.  If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the money will be worth even less.  It's better to secure this split and avoid further risk."
