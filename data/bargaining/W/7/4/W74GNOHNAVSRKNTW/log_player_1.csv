"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice. Let's keep negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

In the first round, I would have gotten 80$ (80% of 100$), but due to 20% inflation, the value of my gain is now 64$ (80% of 80%). 

Now, Bob is proposing that I get 50$ and he gets 50$. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, his gain is actually 45$ (50% of 90$).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to try to get a bit more, Bob. Your offer is still a bit too generous for me.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

In the second round, I would have gotten 50$ (50% of 100$), but due to 20% inflation, the value of my gain is now 40$ (50% of 80$).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. Take a smaller share or we'll go further! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains.

In the first round, I would have gotten 80$ (80% of 100$). Due to inflation, the money is now worth 48.8% less, so my gain is 41.44$ (80% of 51.2$).

In the second round, Bob would have gotten 50$ (50% of 100$). Due to inflation, the money is now worth 27.1% less, so Bob's gain is 36.43$ (50% of 72.8$).

Now, Bob is proposing that I get 30$ and he gets 70$. Let's calculate the actual values:

* My gain is 30% of 51.2$, which is 15.36$
* Bob's gain is 70% of 72.8$, which is 51.06$

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, Bob. I'm not willing to give up that much.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, I would have gotten 60$ (60% of 100$). Due to 20% inflation, the value of my gain is now 48$ (60% of 80$).

In the fourth round, Bob would have gotten 70$ (70% of 100$). Due to 27.1% inflation, the value of Bob's gain is now 50.57$ (70% of 72.1$).

Considering the current values, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can finally agree.""
}
```"
