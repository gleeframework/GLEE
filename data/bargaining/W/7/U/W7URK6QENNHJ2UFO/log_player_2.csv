"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn to propose something more reasonable. This offer is better for me than what you'll get next round if you decline.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, now it's less favorable for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. The value is decreasing rapidly, and this ensures we both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your even split was nice, but I can do slightly better for myself 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The money is losing value for Bob at an alarming rate (almost 60% less than its original value). 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better offer in the future isn't worth the risk. If Alice continues the trend of slightly increasing her share, the potential gain for Bob will be minimal compared to the loss in value he'll experience waiting. 

While not ideal, accepting a 43/57 split now cuts losses and avoids the risk of walking away with even less in future rounds."
