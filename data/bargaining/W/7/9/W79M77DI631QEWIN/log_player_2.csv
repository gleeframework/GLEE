Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money I gain is worth significantly less now, and Alice's gains are even more severely impacted. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject, there's no guarantee Alice will make a better offer in the next round. The inflation will continue to devalue my potential gains.
* **Fairness:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonably fair given the circumstances.

At this point, accepting seems like the best strategy to secure a substantial amount, even with the inflation impact."
