Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 54/46. This way, we both get a slightly better deal than last round. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the deal. While it's not ideal, I'm getting more than last round and inflation is starting to bite."
