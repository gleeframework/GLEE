"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the difference!""
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to fight! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 60 is still worth 60, but Bob's share of 40 is now worth 38.

I like the idea of meeting in the middle, and 50-50 seems like a fair split. I'll accept Bob's offer.
