"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split - 90% for me and 10% for you. Let's get this over with!

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was absurd! I'm proposing a more realistic split. I understand the time pressure, so let's be reasonable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 4000 is too low. Let's meet in the middle at 6000 for me and 4000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant. It's worthwhile to hold out a bit longer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. The clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a 55/45 split - a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a split that is advantageous to me before the effects of inflation become too severe."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 5500 for me, 4500 for you. Let's settle this before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has agreed to the split I proposed in the previous round. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount before inflation erodes the value further. It's better to take a slightly smaller but guaranteed win than risk getting nothing at all."
