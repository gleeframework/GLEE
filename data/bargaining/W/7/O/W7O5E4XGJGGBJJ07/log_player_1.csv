"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly.  I figure a little bit of money now is better than a lot of money later if it keeps getting devalued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even with the 20% devaluation.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is a fair offer considering the devaluation, and it's in my best interest to avoid another round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still less than the 500,000 I was aiming for, even with the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than in my previous offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise, and we can reach an agreement."
