**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer will significantly erode the overall value, even if we could secure a slightly better split.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for Alice.  He started at a 55/45 split in his favor and is now at a 60/40 split. This suggests he's unlikely to offer anything better.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a specific amount. Rejecting means risking an even lower offer in the future, with a significantly reduced overall value due to inflation."
