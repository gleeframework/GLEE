# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk losing everything. With the money I gain being worth so much less due to inflation, I think 40% is a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer."
