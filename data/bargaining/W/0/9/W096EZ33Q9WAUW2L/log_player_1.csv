"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. It's a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and I'm already getting a relatively smaller share, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 75-25 split, which is a bit too lopsided for me.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting a smaller share, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. It's a 55.5-44.5 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split. I'll have to think carefully about this one. Given the decreasing value of my share, I'll have to take a more aggressive approach to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make a more aggressive move. I'll try to get a better deal by offering a smaller share to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. It's a 70-30 split. This is a riskier move, but I need to try to get a better deal before the value of my share drops too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is dropping rapidly, and Bob's offer is a 20-80 split. I'm getting a very small share, but it's still more than the previous offer. I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of my share, I'll accept this offer.
