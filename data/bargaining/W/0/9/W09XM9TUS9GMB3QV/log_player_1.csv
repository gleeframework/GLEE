"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and taking $55 for myself, with a message encouraging him to accept the offer and end the game. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less now, Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually equivalent to $42.75 in the first round. Considering this, I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Hopefully, we can come to a mutually acceptable agreement soon!
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less now due to two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to try and find a middle ground. I'll propose $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, which is slightly more generous than my initial offer, considering the decreased value of the money. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this proposal!
