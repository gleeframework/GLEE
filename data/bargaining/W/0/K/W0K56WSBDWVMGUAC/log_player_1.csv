Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your starting offer, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation rate is higher for you. Let's try that instead. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough decision! Let's analyze:

**Pros of Accepting:**

* **Something is better than nothing:** If we keep rejecting offers, we risk getting to round 12 and getting $0. 
* **Bob's offer isn't terrible:** While not ideal, getting $4000 is still a significant sum.

**Pros of Rejecting:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob knows the inflation hurts me more. By rejecting, I signal I'm willing to play hardball, potentially pushing him towards a more favorable split in later rounds.
* **Inflation favors me in later rounds:** As the rounds progress, the relative difference in our inflation rates becomes more significant, giving me a stronger bargaining position.

**Decision:**

This is a gamble, but I think it's worth the risk. Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor. I believe I can get a better deal.
