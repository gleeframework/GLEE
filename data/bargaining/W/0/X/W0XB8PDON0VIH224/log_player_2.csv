Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm getting a little nervous now. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my share, but I still need a majority. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with the increasing inflation, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses a significant amount of potential money. It's better to hold out and propose a more equitable split, even with the shrinking pot. There's still time to negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous. We're both losing out because of your greed.  I'm offering a 50/50 split, take it or leave it. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to lay down the law.  By now, it should be clear to Alice that Bob is willing to walk away from a bad deal. Offering a 50/50 split emphasizes fairness and presents a strong stance. The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure, hoping Alice will accept rather than risk losing everything."
