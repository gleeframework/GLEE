"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away the whole thing!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe a more balanced split is in order. I'm willing to offer you 400000, but I'll need the remaining 600000 for myself. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I think I can do better. I'll need a bit more to make it worth my while, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share, and I can still make a good profit despite the inflation.""
}
```"
