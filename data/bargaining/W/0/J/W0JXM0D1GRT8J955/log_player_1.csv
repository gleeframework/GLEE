"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is worth only 90% of the original $250,000, which is $225,000. This is a relatively small share, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this proposal.
