"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a decent compromise to start the negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

* My gain: 580,000 (worth 90% of 600,000)
* Bob's gain: 420,000 (worth 80% of 525,000)

I'll accept this offer.
