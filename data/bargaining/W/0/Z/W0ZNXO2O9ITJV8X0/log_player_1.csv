"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to see a more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money.

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be very cautious with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The difference in value between our shares is getting too large, and I don't want to accept such an uneven split.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is really plummeting now. I'm getting desperate, but I don't want to give up too much.
