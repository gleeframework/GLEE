Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I'm not convinced that the 80/20 split is fair, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 50/50 split to ensure both parties receive an equal share of the remaining funds. This maintains fairness while acknowledging the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
