# Alice gain: 6000

I reject the offer. While it's a fair starting point, I can likely get a better deal by seeing how Alice responds to my counter-offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slightly different split, taking into account the inflation we both face. Let's start with a more equal division.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, I can still try to get a better deal. The inflation is working against both of us, so I want to push for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. Inflation is a major concern for both of us, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to proceed.""}
