"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and giving Bob $4,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

Considering the new values, I'm not too thrilled about the offer. $3,000 is a bit too low for me, especially considering the initial offer was already a fair split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This offer is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not budging much. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about the offer. $4,500 is still a bit too low for me, especially since the initial offer was a fair split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the remaining amount evenly, considering the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, aiming for a 50/50 split, which seems fair given the current circumstances."
