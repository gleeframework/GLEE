"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. This way, I'll get a significant chunk of the money, but it's still a fair offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, his offer is actually equivalent to:

Alice gain: 450000
Bob gain: 517500

I'll accept this offer.
