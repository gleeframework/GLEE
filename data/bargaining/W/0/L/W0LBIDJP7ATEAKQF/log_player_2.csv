{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have to deal with inflation. Let's find a solution we can both agree on.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is hitting us both, so a more even division seems fair.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
