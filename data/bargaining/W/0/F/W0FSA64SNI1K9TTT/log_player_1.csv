"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very straightforward division, keeping most of the money for myself.  I figure that Bob is likely to be greedy as well, so I'll see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and the fact that it's my turn next. Accepting this ensures I get something, and I can try to negotiate better in the next round."
