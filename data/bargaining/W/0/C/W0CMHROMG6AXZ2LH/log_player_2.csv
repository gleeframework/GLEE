Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a slight advantage, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable: 55/45. This way we both get something substantial before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
