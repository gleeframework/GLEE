"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is worth $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth $500,000 * 0.95 = $475,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
