"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer for now. I'll get 49 dollars, which is worth 95% of the original amount, and Bob will get 51 dollars, which is worth 102% of the original amount (but that's okay, I'll take the 95%).
