"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80/20""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $4,500 is now worth $4,050.

I'm not convinced that this offer is any better than the first one, and I'm still hoping for a more favorable split. So, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my offer in Round 3 is worth even less. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 60/40""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob, hoping that this more aggressive offer will be more appealing to him."
