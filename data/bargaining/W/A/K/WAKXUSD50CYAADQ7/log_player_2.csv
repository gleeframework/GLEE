"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a decent amount upfront. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since the money loses value each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better with a more even split.  Let's be fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is money! This offer is still generous, but I need you to be realistic about the declining value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, and I still think I can get a better deal. The declining value is a factor, but I'm willing to risk it for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's get closer to a 50/50 split.  We both stand to lose more the longer we wait.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking and we both lose if this deal falls through. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the declining value is a serious concern. Alice's offer is better than what I could get in the next round, so I'll accept."
