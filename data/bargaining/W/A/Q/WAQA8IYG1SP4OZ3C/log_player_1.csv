"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small amount, but it's a good starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it seems like a fair deal on the surface, due to inflation, the money I gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose an 85/15 split in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to secure a substantial portion of the money to offset the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is much worse than my initial proposal, the inflation rate is rapidly reducing the value of the money.  I need to accept this offer to avoid losing even more."
