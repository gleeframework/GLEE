"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, considering that with each passing round, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Bob. I believe this is a fair initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation affects me more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting him more, his proposed split of 60/40 in his favor seems too skewed. Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I believe there's room for a more balanced division. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the increased inflation impact, let's meet in the middle""
}

In this offer, I've reduced my share and increased Bob's share slightly, taking into account the greater impact of inflation on his portion. I believe this is a reasonable compromise."
