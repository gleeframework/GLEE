"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  I'm starting with a large offer for myself, but I want to see if Bob will accept.  I want to get as much as possible while still leaving some incentive for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $6,000, I know that the inflation will affect me more heavily in the future. I'm willing to gamble and hope that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, hoping that he'll see this as a better deal than the previous round.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good amount for myself while also leaving enough for Bob to feel like it's worth accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  With the inflation rate, I'm likely to get less than $5,000 if we continue.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances."
