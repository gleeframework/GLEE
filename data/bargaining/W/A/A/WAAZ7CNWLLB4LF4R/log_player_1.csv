Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value for me, I'm willing to compromise. This is my most generous offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Bob claims to be making a generous offer, time is on my side. His share continues to decrease in value with each round. Holding out for a better offer in the next round is the more strategic move, even with a slight risk that he might offer even less."
