"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $475,000 in the original terms.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a bit more, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $475,000 in the previous round is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $450,500 in the original terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300,000. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous than in the first round, but still getting a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40, with me taking 60% and you taking 40%.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation, and we can finally end this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $700,000 in the previous round is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $637,100 in the original terms.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal with this 40/60 split. Considering the inflation, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $637,100 in the previous round is worth 63.71% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $637,100 in the original terms.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $450,000. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```
