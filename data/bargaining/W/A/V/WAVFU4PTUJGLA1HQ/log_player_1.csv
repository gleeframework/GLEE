"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm starting with the first move and have the opportunity to propose the terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $7,600.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. If I accept, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 40% of the original $10,000. If I reject, I'll get to make the next offer, but the money will be worth 5% less again.

For now, I'll reject the offer and make the next one.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation adjustment, the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value (95% * 95%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $6,000 from the previous round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $5,144.40.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $3,000 * 85.74% = $2,562.20
* Bob's gain: $7,000 * 72.9% = $5,043.00

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get $2,562.20, which is worth 25.62% of the original $10,000. If I reject, I'll get to make the next offer, but the money will be worth 5% less again.

For now, I'll reject the offer and make the next one.
