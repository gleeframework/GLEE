"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the money is worth less with every round. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  We both lose out if this keeps going. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer more, the risk of getting nothing is too high."
