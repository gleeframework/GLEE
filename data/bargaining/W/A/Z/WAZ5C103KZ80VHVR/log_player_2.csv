"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your turn Alice.  I was feeling generous last round, but inflation is a cruel mistress.  Let's be realistic.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, don't be too greedy! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, it's getting too risky to push further. 

Here's why:

* **My diminishing returns:** Another rejection means I face another 5% inflation hit, making even good offers less appealing in future rounds.
* **Alice's steeper decline:** Her 20% inflation rate means she's losing value far quicker. While she's acting tough now, her position will worsen significantly in another round.
* **Certainty vs. Gamble:** Accepting a slightly less-than-ideal offer now is better than gambling on a future round where Alice might be desperate enough to accept anything."
