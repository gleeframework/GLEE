"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, which is a 20% share for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said fair split, I'll take it 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to make a decision based on the new values.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
