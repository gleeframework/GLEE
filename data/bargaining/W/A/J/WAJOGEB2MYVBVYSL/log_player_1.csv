I'm going to be greedy and keep most of the money for myself! ðŸ¤‘  I'll give Bob a small amount, hoping he'll be happy with it and accept the offer. But let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a lot of money, I'm going to accept this offer. My share is worth much less than the last round because of inflation, and I'm not sure how much longer this game will go on.  It's better to take what I can get now rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
