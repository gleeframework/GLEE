"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both walk away with a nice sum!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer to try to get him to accept quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being fair here. Let's split this 90/10, and we can both get something out of this. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

$100,000 * 0.8 (80% of the original value) = $80,000

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd be getting only $80,000, which is less than half of the original $100,000. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
