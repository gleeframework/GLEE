"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You'll get 1 dollar, I'll get the rest. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
One dollar is not worth it.  I'll take my chances with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer to getting a dollar, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Bob gain: 0.5 
# Alice gain: 999999.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is technically more than the previous round, it's still ridiculously low. I need to hold out for a fairer deal, especially with inflation hitting my side so hard."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a good portion to make this worth it for me.  We're losing money with every round!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting close to getting a quarter, but I'm still the one calling the shots! 
# Bob gain: 0.25 
# Alice gain: 999999.75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take something after all this time, I'm still not convinced.  This is nowhere near a fair split, and I'm not giving in to Alice's ""call the shots"" attitude.  I'm hoping I can push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with every round!  Let's be realistic and agree on a deal that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to give you more than a third, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Time is running out!""}
