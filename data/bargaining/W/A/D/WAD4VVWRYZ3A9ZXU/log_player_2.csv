"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can work out a better deal later if we want. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice responds to a firm rejection.  There is a significant potential gain for me if the money is split more evenly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Take it or let's see what happens to the value of our shares.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's avoid further devaluation and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting nervous, which is good, but still not budging enough. I need to keep the pressure on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out!  I'm holding firm at 65/35.  You're losing more each round by being stubborn.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still holding out for a more equitable split, but I'm willing to budge a bit more. 45/55 is my final offer. Let's not let this valuable money disappear. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to accept.  Alice is clearly unwilling to go higher and the 55/45 split is now in my favor.  Continuing to hold out risks us both walking away with nothing, and something is better than nothing at this point."
