Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  Inflation hurts you more than me, so it's in your best interest to accept now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
