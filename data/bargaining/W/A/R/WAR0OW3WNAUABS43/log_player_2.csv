{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  Inflation hurts you more than me, so it's in your best interest to accept now.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag out hurts us both. I'll take a small hit from my original offer - 55/45.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
