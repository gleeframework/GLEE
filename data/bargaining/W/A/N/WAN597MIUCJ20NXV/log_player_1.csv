Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to end the game quickly.  Since the money is worth less to Bob, I'm not as concerned about making him happy in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I get a much smaller share than my initial proposal, the inflation rate makes it much more valuable to me than what Bob offered in the first round. I'd rather take the money now than risk getting even less in a future round."
