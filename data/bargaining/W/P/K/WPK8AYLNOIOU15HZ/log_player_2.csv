Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the inflation is hitting Alice harder, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a significant amount of the potential gain compared to a fair split. I need to hold out for a better offer, as accepting this sets a bad precedent for future rounds."
