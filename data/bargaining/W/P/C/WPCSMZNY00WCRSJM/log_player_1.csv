"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive offer in the first round.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I want to grab as much as possible right away. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty generous, but I'm still holding out for more. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference between my first offer and Bob's offer.  I think this is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty good, and with inflation eating away at the value of the money for him, I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer and finish the game."
