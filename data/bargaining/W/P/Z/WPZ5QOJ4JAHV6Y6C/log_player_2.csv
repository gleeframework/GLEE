"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, but I get a little more since the money loses value for me over time. A 52.5/47.5 split seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more since the money loses value for me over time""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm Bob, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for me over time. I'll offer a 55/45 split in my favor, which is still relatively fair but takes into account the 5% decrease in value for me. Let's see if Alice accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I realize the money loses value for you. Let's settle closer to the middle - 51/49? 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I'll receive is lower than the nominal value. Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'll receive: 4900 * 0.9025 (1 - 0.0975) = 4427.25. I think I can get a better deal than that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bigger share to make up for the loss in value""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me over time, I'll try to increase my share to compensate for the loss. I'll offer a 58/42 split in my favor. Let's see if Alice accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. We're approaching the halfway point, and we both lose if this fails. Let's split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nLet's calculate the actual value of the money I'll receive, considering the inflation: 5000 * 0.8145 (1 - 0.1855) = 4072.5. Since we're approaching the halfway point and the actual value of the money I'll receive is decreasing, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further losses.###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###"
