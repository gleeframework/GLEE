Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation that will affect my side if we go to another round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're losing money with every round, and my offer is the best you're going to get. Take the 55/45 split before it gets even worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
