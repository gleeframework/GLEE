"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the initial amount""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the initial amount of 1,000,000."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's too aggressive. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is quite skewed in Bob's favor. I'll wait for his next proposal to see if we can find a better compromise."
