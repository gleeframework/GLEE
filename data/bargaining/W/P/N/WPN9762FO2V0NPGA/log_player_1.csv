"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. I'm taking a bit more than half, but not so much that it's unreasonable. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a good offer and that he should accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly this time.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's offer is not as generous as it seems. With the money being worth 5% less for me, I'd actually be getting less than $380,000 in value, while Bob would be getting significantly less than $480,000 in value due to his 20% inflation rate. Given the significant drop in value for Bob, I think I can negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for both of us""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob. Given the inflation rates, I believe this offer is more generous than it initially seems. Bob's share, although reduced in nominal value, is actually closer to what he would have received in real value in the previous round, considering the significant inflation he faces. My message aims to highlight this aspect, suggesting that accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us, especially considering the devaluing effect of inflation on future offers."
