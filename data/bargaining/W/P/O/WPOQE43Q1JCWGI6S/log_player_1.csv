"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your 50/50 split sounds fair in principle, but the value of the money decreases over time, and the decrease is worse for you than for me.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for this difference.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
