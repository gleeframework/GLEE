Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation we'll both face. Let's end this early and both get a good chunk of the money.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to compromise with a 55/45 split, which is still more than your last offer. Let's make a deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to use the threat of inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal.  While I am losing value each round, accepting a 45/55 split after already rejecting 40/60 would make me seem weak in the negotiation.  I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this before we both lose out to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. The pressure is increasing.
* **Signaling Fairness:** By offering 50/50, I am demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a solution that benefits both of us. 
* **Minimizing Losses:** While I believe I could get a better deal, waiting any longer significantly risks losing a substantial amount of money due to inflation.  

It's time to make Bob a deal he can't refuse."
