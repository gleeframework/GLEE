"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, giving Bob a small token amount. I'm hoping this will make him accept, as he gets something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair split and I'm not sure how much longer we can play before the money becomes worthless."
