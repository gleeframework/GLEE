"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering we both have equal power in the negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is not as good as my initial proposal, it's still a reasonable outcome considering the inflation factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least some money, while rejecting it could lead to a worse outcome in the next round."
