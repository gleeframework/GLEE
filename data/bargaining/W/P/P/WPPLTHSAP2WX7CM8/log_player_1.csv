Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This leaves room for negotiation in the future if he rejects my offer, as I understand that his money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
