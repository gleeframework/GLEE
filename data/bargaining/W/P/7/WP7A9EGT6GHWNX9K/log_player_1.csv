"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This way, I'll get 80% of the money, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my initial offer of 80$ for me and 20$ for Bob would be equivalent to 76$ and 20$ respectively, which is even worse for me.

Considering Bob's new offer of 70$ for me and 30$ for Bob, I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
