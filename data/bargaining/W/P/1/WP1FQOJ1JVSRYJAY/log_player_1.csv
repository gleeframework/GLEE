**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims fairness, the deal is getting significantly worse for me with each round. The inflation is hitting him harder, but he's overestimating its impact to justify an unfair split. It's better to hold out and counter with a stronger offer, making it clear that I understand the inflation dynamic but won't be taken advantage of."
