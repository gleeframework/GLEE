"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a generous offer, but I expect a fair negotiation. Let's work together to split the money fairly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the easy money, this offer is highly lopsided.  There's a lot of room for negotiation and I'm sure we can reach a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering a 60/40 split, which I believe is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can still find a better split that's more equitable for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still very unequal, and I believe we can find a better solution that benefits us both.  Let's continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest solution, and it allows us both to get a significant share of the money.""}
