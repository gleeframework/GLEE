I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. There's no way I'm going to get less than 50% of the money, especially since I know there's inflation at play. Let's see what Alice offers next."

I'm offering a fair split right off the bat.  50/50 is the most logical way to start, especially considering the inflation factor. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
