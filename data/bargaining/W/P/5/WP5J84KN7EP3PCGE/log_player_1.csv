"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message trying to convince him that it's a fair deal. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was too low. Let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for me now, and 40% less than the original value, so I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and being reasonable. Let me know what Bob decides!"
