"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. I hope this will be enough to encourage him to accept, as the risk of inflation is high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal, the inflation makes it much less appealing. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob, given the previous round's rejection.  While I'm still aiming for a large share, I recognize the importance of finding a compromise to avoid further inflation risks."
