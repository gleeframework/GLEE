Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive split in the first round. I'm hoping that Bob will be unsure of the inflation rate and take this deal. It's a significant advantage for me, but it could be risky if Bob is aware of the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. Even though I'm getting significantly less than I wanted in the first round, the 20% loss in value means that taking this offer is still better than risking another round and potentially getting even less."
