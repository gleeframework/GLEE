"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point considering the inflation factor. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and it's only going to get worse for me with each passing round. I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm reducing my proposed share slightly to 8500, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  This is still a much better deal for me than Bob's offer, and I hope he'll see reason.  I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point of being completely taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  I'm still holding out hope for a better deal, even though the risk of getting nothing increases with each round.  I'm going to reject this offer and try again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still offering Bob a significant amount.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to start making compromises to avoid getting nothing.  I hope Bob realizes that we both need to find a solution quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  I need to try and negotiate a better outcome, even though the time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still offering Bob a decent amount.  The inflation is becoming a real concern now, and I need to reach a compromise to avoid getting nothing.  I hope Bob recognizes that we need to agree on a deal soon."
