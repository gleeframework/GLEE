"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
