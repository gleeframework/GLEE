"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the 5% inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, which means he's actually getting a better deal than in the first round.

Considering Bob's message, he thinks a 60-40 split in his favor is fair, but I think it's a bit too much. I was initially willing to accept a 60-40 split in my favor, and now Bob is asking for the opposite.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly better deal. Let's try 55-45 in my favor""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which means I'll get $5,500 and Bob will get $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to the initial 60-40 split I was willing to accept."
