"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob. This is a good starting point that ensures I get a significant share while giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $850,000 for me and $150,000 for Bob.  This shows flexibility while still ensuring a large share for myself. Bob's rejection of my previous offer indicates he wants more, but I believe this offer is still fair given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $800,000 for me and $200,000 for Bob.  This is a compromise, and while I'm willing to give up more, I need to ensure a good return for myself as well.  With each round, Bob's gains are decreasing due to inflation, so I believe this offer is still favorable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $750,000 for me and $250,000 for Bob. This is a significant concession, but given Bob's consistent rejections and the increasing impact of inflation on his potential gains, I believe this offer is the most fair and likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly attractive with each round due to inflation. At this point, accepting is the best strategy to secure some of the money before it's worth even less to him."
