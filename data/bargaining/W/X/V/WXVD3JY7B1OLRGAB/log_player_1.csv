"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $9,000 I had initially is now worth $8,550. And the $1,000 I offered to Bob is still worth $1,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Splitting it evenly means I'll get $5,000, which is less than I initially had. But it's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk getting less if we go to another round.

I'll accept this offer.
