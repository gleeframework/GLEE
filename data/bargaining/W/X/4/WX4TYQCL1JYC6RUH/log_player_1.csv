Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time, I think we can both be happy with this 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, but still think I deserve the bigger share""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI already sent my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, but still think I deserve the bigger share""}\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects it.\n\n###\n\nIf you'd like, I can explain my reasoning behind this offer. I took into account the inflation rates for both of us and tried to find a balance between being fair and taking advantage of Bob's higher inflation rate. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate!"
