"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something, hoping he will accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less, a 50/50 split is a fair deal.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the risk of inflation means the offer might get worse."
