Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think it's fair to propose a split of 45 for me and 55 for you. This way, we both get a portion that adjusts for the decrease in value. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
