"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I get 60%""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to propose a division that is slightly in my favor to account for the potential loss. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this proposal and accept it, ending the game early and minimizing the impact of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering we both have equal bargaining power here. Let's start with a 55/45 split and see how it goes. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 4500 in the second round is actually equivalent to accepting less than 4500 in the first round. Since I initially proposed a 60/40 split in my favor, accepting 45% now would be a significant concession, especially given that the value of the money is decreasing for me but not for Bob. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a slight concession from my initial offer. This is as low as I'm comfortable going for now.""}\n\nMy reasoning is that I need to balance the urgency of reaching an agreement before the inflation significantly impacts my share with the need to negotiate a favorable deal. By reducing my proposed share slightly, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a division that reflects the decreasing value of the money for me."
