"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to test the waters""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get the most before the money starts depreciating for you. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob!

I'll accept his proposal. The even split is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value as the rounds go on.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
