"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 3:2. This seems fair given the risk and uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 3:2 split might seem fair initially, the risk of inflation is significant.  Rejecting and proposing in the next round gives me a chance to secure a larger share before the money loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose we split the money 6:4.  This is a more favorable split for me considering the risk of inflation in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a 50/50 split is fair given the uncertainty and risk of future rounds. It ensures both of us receive an equal share of the remaining funds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now, a 50/50 split is the best I can realistically expect given Alice's rejection of my proposal.  Further rounds increase the risk of getting less than this."
