"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10 to start. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping this will set a strong foundation for a good negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to counteroffer next round. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* I would get $250,000, which is worth 25% of the original $1,000,000 (due to 20% inflation).
* Bob would get $750,000, which is worth 75% of the original $1,000,000 (due to 5% inflation).

Since this is a relatively close split, and Bob's offer is still quite generous, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to do better next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous in round 2, I'm trying to balance it out now.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to find a more balanced agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a better balance. Your turn again next round! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* I would get $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original $1,000,000 (due to 48.8% inflation).
* Bob would get $550,000, which is worth 55% of the original $1,000,000 (due to 14.26% inflation).

This split seems more balanced, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it."
