I propose to keep 900,000$ and give 100,000$ to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I propose to keep 600,000$ and give 400,000$ to Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose to split the money evenly, each taking 500,000$.  With the value of the money decreasing with each round, it's better to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting risky, and the money keeps losing value.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to take this offer and secure some gain than risk ending up with nothing."
