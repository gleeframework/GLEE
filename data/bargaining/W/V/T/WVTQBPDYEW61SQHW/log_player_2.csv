Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Explanation:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Bob.  Waiting longer means a worse deal even if he gets a slightly higher percentage.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems firm on getting at least 45.  Rejecting this offer risks her becoming more entrenched, potentially leading to no deal at all.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of reaching no agreement and getting $0 is very high.

It's a tough decision, but taking the sure deal now outweighs the risk of losing everything.
