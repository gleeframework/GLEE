"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take 100k and let's get this over with.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll go down to 70/30. But this is my final offer. If you reject it, we both lose more money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and trying to pressure me. While the money is losing value, I'm confident I can get a better deal than 30% in the next few rounds.  It's still early in the game."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal. Let's settle this before the money shrinks any further.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is my last stand. The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is working against me more than it's working against Alice.  While I think I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in the next round or two, the risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly. Accepting a 40/60 split now guarantees a decent payout, even with inflation."
