"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, considering that the money loses value faster for Bob than it does for me. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it accounts for the differing inflation rates we're experiencing. Hopefully, Bob finds this proposal reasonable.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse the roles this round. I think we can both do better. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Given the inflation rates, accepting this offer would mean I'd be getting significantly less value than I initially proposed, while Bob tries to take advantage of his initial rejection to flip the split in his favor. It's time for me to make a new proposal that considers the current value of the money.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nMy new proposal will be:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the current value after inflation, this is a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the current value after inflation, this is a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, I've adjusted my proposal to still reflect a balance that considers the faster depreciation of the money's value for Bob, while also ensuring I don't lose out too much from the initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will find this revised split acceptable.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better share than Alice's last offer. Let's find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nBob's new offer doesn't seem to adequately consider the significant decrease in value for both of us, especially with his money now being worth almost half as much as it was initially. His proposed split doesn't compensate enough for the loss I'd be taking, especially considering my last offer was more generous in terms of the current value of the money.\n\n###\n\nIt's time to make another proposal that better reflects the current situation.\n\n###\n\nMy new proposal will be:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation, this split is more reflective of our current situation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation, this split is more reflective of our current situation.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the substantial loss in value for both of us, especially Bob, I've decided to slightly adjust my offer to still ensure I'm getting a larger share due to the lesser impact of inflation on my end. However, I'm also trying to be fair and acknowledge the severe depreciation of the money's value for Bob, hence the slight adjustment from my previous offer.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer or if we'll need to continue negotiating."
