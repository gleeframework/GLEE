"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation loss for both of us, I think this split is more reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, it's important to consider the increasing inflation. Holding out further might result in even lower gains for me."
