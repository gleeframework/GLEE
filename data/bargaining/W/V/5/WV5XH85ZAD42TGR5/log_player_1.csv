Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

I'm offering 60 dollars to myself and 40 dollars to Bob."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","For Round 2, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer.

I'm offering 55 dollars to myself and 45 dollars to Bob."
