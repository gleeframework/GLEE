I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn!"

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the new total is $8,000.

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too even for me, Bob. I'd like a slightly bigger share.""
