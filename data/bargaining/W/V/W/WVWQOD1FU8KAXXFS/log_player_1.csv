"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, let's start with that. We can adjust if you want to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll think for a moment... Since Bob's offer is the same as mine from Round 1, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was the same as mine from Round 1, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a 55-45 split is more fair considering the inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his benefit!

I'll think for a moment... Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth less, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation.
