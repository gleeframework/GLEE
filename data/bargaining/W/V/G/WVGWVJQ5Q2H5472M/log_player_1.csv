Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more than 30, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than that""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, while still being reasonable. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much more! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting closer to the deadline, I think I'll accept this offer. 80 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and getting an even worse deal."
