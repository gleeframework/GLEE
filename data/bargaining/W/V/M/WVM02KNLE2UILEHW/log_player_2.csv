"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this strategically.  While a 40% share is good, there's room for negotiation.  I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a larger share. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go, especially with inflation eating away at the value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to keep more, 50% is a good deal considering the inflation, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
