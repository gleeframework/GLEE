**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted to a critical point.  Here's why accepting is now the best, albeit not ideal, option:

* **Severe Inflation:** The 59.04% inflation for Bob is crippling. Every round makes a significant dent in the value of any potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language (""final offer,"" ""reasonable amount"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is highly risky. The inflation will quickly erode any potential gains, potentially leading to a worse outcome than the current offer. 

**While not ideal, taking the 4400 (heavily impacted by inflation) is better than risking getting nothing if Alice holds firm and the rounds run out.**"
