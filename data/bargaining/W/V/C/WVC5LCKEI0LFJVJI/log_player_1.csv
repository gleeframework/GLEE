"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not losing any value due to inflation. However, I'm gaining 20% less than I would have in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such an unfair split. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still want to keep some buffer""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent buffer for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, I'm still trying to hold on to as much value as possible.

I'll think carefully about this offer... Hmm... I'm not thrilled about giving up so much more, but I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't settle soon.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more reasonable in future rounds. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'll take this deal, but I hope you'll be more generous in the future""}"
