Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to compromise, but this offer feels like a fairer split for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I need to hold firm for a little longer.  While the inflation is hurting, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half is a losing strategy.  There's still time to negotiate a better outcome."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and we need to find a way to split this fairly. Let's go with a 50/50 split.  It's the most equitable option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While ideally, I'd want a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of my potential gain diminishes significantly with each passing round. Waiting any longer could lead to a much smaller net gain, even if I manage to secure a slightly better split.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair. Alice is unlikely to agree to a deal where she receives significantly less, especially as time runs out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees a substantial sum."
