Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the offer, the money remains at $10,000. Now it's my turn to make a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 19% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice's offer: Bob gets $6000, which is worth $6000 / 0.81 = $7411.11 in the first round's value
* Alice gets $4000, which is worth $4000 / 0.81 = $4944.44 in the first round's value

I'll accept this offer.
