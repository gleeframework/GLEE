"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept quickly so we can both get our money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 20% less, so I need to think carefully. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time, considering the inflation. Since my potential gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! My potential gain is worth almost half of what it was initially. Bob's offer is still a bit too close to the previous one, but I'm running out of time and options.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
