"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm starting off strong, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 80%, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in negotiating and accepting this offer before the inflation continues to affect the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is being very greedy. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and see if he gets desperate. I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm dropping my share again, but I'm hoping Bob will start to see the value in getting at least some of the money. We are both losing money due to inflation, so it's in both our best interests to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is still being stubborn. I'm not going to accept this offer. I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm dropping my share to 60%, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round and will finally agree to something reasonable."
