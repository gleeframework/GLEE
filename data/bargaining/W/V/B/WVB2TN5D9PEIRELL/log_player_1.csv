"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. My message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Splitting it 50/50 seems like a fair deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer now against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to make a slightly more advantageous offer for myself. I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. His offer is closer to my original offer in round 1, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to push the ratio even more in my favor. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob!""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try to find a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer. Bob's offer is still relatively close to the 60/40 ratio I proposed in round 5, but he's trying to push the ratio in his favor. I'll consider the fact that the money is worth less for him due to inflation, but I still want to get a better deal for myself.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the fact that Bob's offers are getting closer to my original proposal in round 1. I'll offer him a smaller share, but I'll make it clear that I'm not willing to compromise further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, let's try to find a better solution! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. It's still a 70/30 ratio, which is close to my previous offers, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer in future rounds.

However, considering the inflation, the value of the money Bob gains is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer to get a fixed amount of money.
