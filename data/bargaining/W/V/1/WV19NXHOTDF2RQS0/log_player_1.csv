"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try for a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
