Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  I'm serious about taking this deal now, before inflation hurts me more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
