Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While time is running out, accepting a 30/70 split when we started with a potential 45/55 split is a significant loss.  I'm betting Alice's patience will wear thinner than my potential earnings in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns. This is a fair deal.  Let's not let greed make us both losers.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point.  Alice needs to feel the pressure too. 
* **Consistency:**  Offering the same split as before shows resolve and might make Alice question her strategy. 
* **Framing:**  The message emphasizes fairness and highlights the risk to both of us if we fail to agree."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. We're both losing money with each round. Let's end this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but several factors are pushing me to accept:

* **Alice's Tone:** Her message suggests this is truly her last offer.  She's right about both of us losing money, but the pressure is on me more due to inflation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting longer for a potentially slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of getting nothing at all if Alice is serious.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While not ideal, 35% isn't a terrible outcome. It's a far cry from the 10% offered initially.

It's a gamble, but waiting any longer feels riskier than accepting what's on the table now."
