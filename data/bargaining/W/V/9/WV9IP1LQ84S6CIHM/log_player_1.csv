"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'd like to adjust my proposal to account for the decreased value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, hoping he'll accept."
