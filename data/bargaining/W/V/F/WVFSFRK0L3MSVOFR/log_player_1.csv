"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small share, but it's enough to potentially incentivize him to accept rather than risk getting nothing in a later round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, the inflation rate means my potential gains are shrinking rapidly with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable portion of the money, while rejecting it risks getting nothing at all in later rounds."
