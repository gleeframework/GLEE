Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation. This is my final offer. Let's close the deal before the value decreases even further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
The value remaining for Bob is diminishing quickly. Accepting a 40/60 split is better than risking getting a worse offer, or even reaching round 6 where his share will be worth even less.
