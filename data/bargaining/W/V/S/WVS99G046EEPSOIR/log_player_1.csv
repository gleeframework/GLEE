"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will reject it and we can negotiate for a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm getting a better deal than I initially offered, but Bob is getting an even better deal than he initially offered. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with an even more extreme offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is looking even more attractive to me now, especially since I'm not getting a better deal than I was in the previous round. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or wait for another round...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
