"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a more fair starting point. We can always negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous to him, considering he gets to keep 55% of the initial $100. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 50-50 split. We can reassess after this round.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise after Bob's initial offer and my rejection of it."
