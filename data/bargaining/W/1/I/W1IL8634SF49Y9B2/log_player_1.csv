"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'll get 60% of the money, which is a fair and reasonable split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me, since the difference between the two options is less significant in terms of real value.

I accept Bob's offer.
