Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in your favor.  I'm sure you realize the money will be worth less for both of us if we delay further. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this 58/42 split in your favor and let's end this. Every round costs us both. Don't get greedy. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I accept the 58/42 split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense for Alice at this stage:

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round diminishes the value, especially for Bob. However, waiting for a much better offer in later rounds is risky as Bob might become even more resistant.
* **Decent Offer:**  A 58/42 split is still in Alice's favor. She's securing a larger portion of the money.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's always a risk Bob might make an even less favorable offer in Round 5. Accepting now guarantees Alice a reasonable share."
