"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000. This way, we both get a significant amount and can still negotiate further if we want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70% this time, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're pushing too hard, Bob! I'll counter with 55% for me and 45% for you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the current $1,000,000, which is $450,000, but I'm taking a bigger share to compensate for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is starting to bite!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I need to take more to keep up with the inflation. 42% for me, 58% for you.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 5% inflation, but I'm still trying to keep a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise on 55% for me, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more? I'll give you 50% and take the rest. I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm pushing back against Bob's offer, trying to maintain a fair share despite the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 385000,
  ""bob_gain"": 615000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need to keep up with the inflation. 38.5% for me, 61.5% for you. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 14.26% inflation, but I'm not sure if it's enough to convince Bob to accept."
