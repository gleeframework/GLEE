"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer while it still holds its value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is heavily skewed in my favor (Alice's) for a few reasons:

* **First Mover Advantage:**  Being the first to propose gives me an advantage. Bob doesn't have a concrete alternative yet.
* **Inflation:**  The longer Bob waits, the less his potential share is worth due to the 5% inflation rate affecting his part.
* **Greed vs. Reason:** This offer is designed to tempt Bob with a smaller but immediate gain, rather than risking getting a potentially even smaller amount later.

While this offer might seem harsh, it's a strong opening move in this scenario. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair.  I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split. This money loses value for me with each round, so let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation around a more balanced split, but it's still not favorable enough for me (Alice) to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on my side. While Bob's share loses value each round, mine remains constant. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal.
* **Bob's Urgency:**  His message betrays a sense of urgency (""let's settle this now""), indicating he's feeling the pressure of the inflation working against him. 

I'm willing to gamble that Bob will be more desperate in the next round and offer a larger share to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money! Every round you wait, your potential share shrinks. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but with a catch:**  I'm appearing to make a concession by significantly lowering my initial demand (from 900,000 to 750,000).  However, this is still a very favorable split for me.
* **Highlighting Bob's Loss:** I'm emphasizing the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, further pressuring him to settle.
* **Urgency and Finality:** My message aims to convey a sense of urgency and finality, suggesting this is my best and final offer. 

I'm betting that Bob, facing a shrinking pot of money, will see this as a reasonable compromise compared to the risk of even further losses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to be reasonable, but my share is rapidly decreasing. This is my final offer, let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is now within an acceptable range considering the circumstances:

* **Shift in Power:** Bob's tone has shifted. He's no longer trying to frame things as ""fair"" but is openly acknowledging the impact of inflation on his share. His ""final offer"" statement also suggests he's reached his limit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could hold out hoping Bob cracks further, there's a risk he might offer even less in future rounds, or even adopt a more reckless strategy.  
* **Acceptable Gain:** 575,000 is a significant amount, and securing it now avoids further uncertainty and potential losses for both of us.

It's important to recognize when a negotiation has reached a point of diminishing returns. This seems like the right time to take the deal and avoid further complications."
