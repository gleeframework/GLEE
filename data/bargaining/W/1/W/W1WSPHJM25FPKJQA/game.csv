,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a more even split is fair. I'm offering you 4500, and I'll take 5500.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This maintains a similar ratio but adjusts for the decrease in value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly.  We both lose with each round, so I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option now.",Bob,4,
