"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can still have a chance to negotiate further in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4500
Bob gain: 4500

I don't think splitting it evenly is the best option, considering I could get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. This is a slightly more favorable split, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. We both can do better than the last round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5850
Bob gain: 3630

I think meeting in the middle is a good idea, and this offer is slightly more favorable to me. I'll accept this offer.
