Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take a slightly larger share this time.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose we divide it equally, considering the decreasing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's proposal is a good one. I'll accept the offer.
