"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, so we both get $50. My message is a straightforward one, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. How about 60/40 in my favor? We can still both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob trying to take a larger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my potential gain is now worth less. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was initially. I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 45. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

My offer is to take 55% and leave 45% for Bob. I'm hoping this is more acceptable to him."
