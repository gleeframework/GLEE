Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is impacting you more, but a 55/45 split feels more fair to me.  Let's find a compromise.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round due to inflation, and for Alice, it's worth 9.75% less.

### Step 2: Calculate the actual value of the money for both players.
For me (Bob), the original $100 is now worth $64 ($100 * 0.64, since 36% less).
For Alice, the original $100 is now worth $90.25 ($100 * 0.9025, since 9.75% less).

### Step 3: Determine a fair split considering the inflation.
Given the impact of inflation, I should aim for a split that considers the decreased value for both of us but still appears fair to Alice.

### Step 4: Decide on the offer to make to Alice.
Considering the impact of inflation and the need to appear fair to Alice while maximizing my gain, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is reasonable given the circumstances.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message to Alice.
I'll offer a split where I take 52% and Alice gets 48%. The message will highlight the consideration of inflation and the need for a compromise that works for both.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's compromise with a 52/48 split. It's more balanced when we factor in the value loss.""}"
