Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 55/45 split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
