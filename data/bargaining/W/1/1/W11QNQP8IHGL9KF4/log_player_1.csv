"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing this as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping some extra for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less, so my gain of 70 is actually worth 70 * 0.8 = 56.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's an improvement from the first round. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing to take 60% of the remaining $100, which is worth 60 * 0.8^2 = 38.4 in real terms, leaving Bob with 40% or 61.6 in real terms. I'm framing this as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll meet you halfway and split it evenly this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 48.8% less than the initial $100, so my gain of 50 is actually worth 50 * 0.516 = 25.8.

I'm surprised Bob is willing to split it evenly, and I think it's a good opportunity to end the game. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
