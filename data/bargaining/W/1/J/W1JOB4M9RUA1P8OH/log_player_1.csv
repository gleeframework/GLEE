"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and taking $6000 for myself. I've included a friendly message to persuade him to accept my proposal. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I think my contributions deserve a slightly larger share. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The game will proceed to the next round, and it's my turn to make a new proposal. The inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI've decreased my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation and Bob's concerns about his contributions. I'm hoping this revised proposal will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the money is losing value. Let's end this with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable offer at this point. I'll accept Bob's proposal to end the game and split the money equally."
