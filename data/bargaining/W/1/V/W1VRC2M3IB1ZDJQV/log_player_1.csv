"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a fair split, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a slightly better deal than my initial offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
