"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

This offer is designed to be tempting for Bob. While I want to maximize my own gain, I'm aware that leaving Bob with nothing might lead him to reject the offer and potentially result in both of us getting nothing. A small amount for him is better than zero, and it might encourage him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage, but I won't be swayed by his tactics. He's offering me a mere $1, while he takes $99 for himself.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate.  I have 11 rounds left, and there's still potential for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even split.  While I'd love to get more, I've realized that continuous rejections might lead to both of us ending up with nothing. An even split is fair, and I hope Bob sees reason and accepts it."
