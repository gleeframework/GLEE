"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as he's getting a good chunk of money.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.  Let's see if I can convince him to be more reasonable!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm still hoping for a fair split, but I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation. This time I'm offering Bob slightly more than his previous offer, which is a compromise. I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of this deal and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse.  I'm sticking with my strategy of trying to negotiate a fair deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all.  I'll keep trying to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering a little less than my previous offer to account for the ongoing inflation.  I'm still hoping for a compromise, but it's getting harder with each round. This is my final offer before Bob gets to make another proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not ideal, but it's getting closer to a fair split. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds and the increasing inflation. Accepting this offer is the best option for me, as it's significantly more than what I'd get if we go another round and he rejects my offer again. I'm hoping for a better outcome next time, but I'm willing to take this for now."
