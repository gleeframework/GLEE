Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my guns on this. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Let's not let greed get in the way of a deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. Bob is losing value much faster than I am. I need to leverage this to secure a better deal, even though it might appear ""greedy."""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a slight concession on my part, acknowledging the time pressure we're both under. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a serious factor now. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable payout. Rejecting it carries a significant risk that we won't reach an agreement in time, leaving both of us with nothing."
