"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. My message is a playful way to try to get him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly.  I think a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining $10,000. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still giving him a decent amount. My message is a bit cheeky, trying to psyche him out and make him think twice about rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try this again.  I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think a 60/40 split is fair given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 60/40 split is still a bit too generous for me, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'd like to try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, but I'm keeping a large majority of the remaining money for myself. My message is a bit confrontational, trying to put pressure on Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know you're playing hardball, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's split it 60/40, with you getting the larger share. We both get something, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 60/40 split is still a bit too generous for me, but I'm starting to consider the fact that the money is rapidly losing its value due to inflation. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a tiny share, but I'm keeping the majority of the remaining money for myself. My message is a bit more forceful, trying to convey that this is my last offer."

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. Let's be realistic.  I'm willing to accept a 70/30 split in your favor. It's a better deal for you than the last offer, and at least I get something. We both have a chance to walk away with some money. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 70/30 split is a significant concession from Bob, and considering the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, I think it's time to consider accepting a deal. I'll take the risk of getting a smaller share rather than risking getting nothing.
