"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm being generous to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, my $200,000 is now worth only 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $180,000. Meanwhile, Bob's $800,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $640,000.

I'm not thrilled about taking only $180,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower value money. I'll accept this offer.
