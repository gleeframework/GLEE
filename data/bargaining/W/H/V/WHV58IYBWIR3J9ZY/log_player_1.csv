"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round. I'm proposing 60/40, but in my favor. You get to keep 40, and I'll take the remaining 60. We can still both benefit, especially as the rounds progress and the money loses value faster for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
