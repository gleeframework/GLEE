60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's flip the script this round. I'm proposing 60/40, but in my favor. You get to keep 40, and I'll take the remaining 60. We can still both benefit, especially as the rounds progress and the money loses value faster for you.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer isn't fair considering the faster rate of inflation for me.  How about a 55/45 split? It's a compromise that still gives you a decent portion.",Alice,3,
