"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

For Alice's gain of 5000, that's equivalent to 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16 in the original value. For Bob's gain of 5000, that's equivalent to 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 in the original value.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting less than I would have in the first round, even though it's still a 50-50 split. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering to take a slightly larger share this time, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
