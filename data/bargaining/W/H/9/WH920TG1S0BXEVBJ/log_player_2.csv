Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Exactly equal, can't get fairer than this 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for a slightly better deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Alice is losing value in the deal faster than I am. The longer we wait, the less appealing the offer will become to her, making her more likely to accept a deal where I get a slight advantage.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both risk getting nothing. 

It's a gamble to hold out for a better offer, and this way I secure a guaranteed win."
