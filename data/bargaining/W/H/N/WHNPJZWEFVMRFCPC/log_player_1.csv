"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, it means he's offering a 50-50 split. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll get 50% of the new total, which is 50% of $10,000 x 0.8 (since the money is worth 80% of its original value) = $4,000.

Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less, he'll get 50% of the new total, which is 50% of $10,000 x 0.9 (since the money is worth 90% of its original value) = $4,500.

However, according to Bob's offer, he's proposing a 50-50 split, which means I'll get $5,000 and Bob will get $5,000. This is more favorable for me than the calculated values above.

So, I'll accept Bob's offer.
