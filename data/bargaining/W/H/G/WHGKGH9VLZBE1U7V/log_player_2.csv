"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, taking into account our different discount rates. Let's start with a 90/10 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a seemingly ""fair"" offer, but let's remember the inflation rates. The 90/10 split, while seemingly advantageous to Alice, is only slightly beneficial to me in the first round. As the rounds progress, my 10% share will be significantly devalued compared to Alice's 90%,  making it crucial to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced starting point.  We both need to factor in the inflation, and this offer accounts for that difference.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, but I believe a 65/35 split is a fairer starting point. It accounts for inflation, and allows us both to get a reasonable share. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired outcome, it's still not ideal.  The inflation rate is making it increasingly important to get a larger share. I'll continue to negotiate for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's try 70/30. We're both losing money each round, and this is a fair way to reflect the faster devaluation of my portion. It's a compromise that gives us both a decent share while acknowledging the impact of inflation.""}
