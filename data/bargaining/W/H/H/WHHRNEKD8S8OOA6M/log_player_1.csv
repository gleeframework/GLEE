"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can finish the game and I can get my 70 dollars!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll receive 30 * 0.95 = 28.5 dollars. This is still a relatively small share, but I'll have to consider the fact that the money is worth less than before.

I'll reject this offer for now and wait for the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll aim to make a more aggressive offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
