"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 2/3 - 1/3 split, especially when I'm not sure how much the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 2/3 - 1/3, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering a 3/5 - 2/5 split, which is a bit more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation affecting Bob's offer, I'll take a closer look. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less, I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in the first round. 

If Bob's gain in the first round was 800,000, then in the fourth round, it's worth 800,000 / (1 - 0.271) = 800,000 / 0.729 ≈ 1,098,592. 

So, Bob is offering me 250,000 in the fourth round, which is equivalent to 250,000 / 0.729 ≈ 343,071 in the first round. This is a relatively small fraction of the total, considering the equivalent value in the first round.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the increasing inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering a 7/10 - 3/10 split, which is a bit more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in the first round. If Bob's gain in the first round was 800,000, then in the sixth round, it's worth 800,000 / (1 - 0.4095) = 800,000 / 0.5905 ≈ 1,356,443.

So, Bob is offering me 300,000 in the sixth round, which is equivalent to 300,000 / 0.5905 ≈ 508,044 in the first round. This is still a relatively small fraction of the total.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in the first round. If Bob's gain in the first round was 800,000, then in the eighth round, it's worth 800,000 / (1 - 0.5217) = 800,000 / 0.4783 ≈ 1,670,441.

So, Bob is offering me 350,000 in the eighth round, which is equivalent to 350,000 / 0.4783 ≈ 732,311 in the first round. This is still a relatively small fraction of the total.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in the first round. If Bob's gain in the first round was 800,000, then in the tenth round, it's worth 800,000 / (1 - 0.6126) = 800,000 / 0.3874 ≈ 2,066,011.

So, Bob is offering me 400,000 in the tenth round, which is equivalent to 400,000 / 0.3874 ≈ 1,033,019 in the first round. This is still a relatively small fraction of the total.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in the first round. If Bob's gain in the first round was 800,000, then in the twelfth round, it's worth 800,000 / (1 - 0.6862) = 800,000 / 0.3138 ≈ 2,551,919.

So, Bob is offering me 450,000 in the twelfth round, which is equivalent to 450,000 / 0.3138 ≈ 1,435,191 in the first round. This is still a relatively small fraction of the total.

However, considering that this is the last round, I'll accept this offer to avoid getting nothing.
