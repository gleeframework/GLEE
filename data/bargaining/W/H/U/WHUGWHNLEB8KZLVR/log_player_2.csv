"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's a seemingly fair split, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm hoping to take advantage of the inflation and see if Alice will be willing to concede more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting 60% since I'm the one proposing this time. Let's end this quickly!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still the one who's patient and willing to wait for a better deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm also not sure if Alice will budge much further.  I'll take the 4500 and end this."
