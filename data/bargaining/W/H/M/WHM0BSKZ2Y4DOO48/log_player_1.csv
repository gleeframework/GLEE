"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to make it worth your while to accept.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but it's still a decent gesture to start the negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about splitting it 50/50, but I think it's a reasonable offer, considering the situation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
