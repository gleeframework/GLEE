"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold.  How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  This round is your last chance to get a decent amount before inflation significantly eats into your potential gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob. But your offer is still too one-sided. Let's compromise: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We both get a reasonable amount before inflation really starts to bite. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is becoming tedious.  You're right, we need to compromise, but your sense of compromise seems skewed.  60/40 in my favor is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the pot shrinks every round.""}
