"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I think this is a fair split, and it's a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $540,000 and Bob gets $460,000. This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm hoping it's more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, let's try to close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
