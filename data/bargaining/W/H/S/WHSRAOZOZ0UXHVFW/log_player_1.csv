"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair start, as it ensures we both get something, and I'm taking a significant portion considering I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I would prefer more, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is now the one making the offer, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
