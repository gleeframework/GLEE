"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. I'm taking the remaining 70%, which is $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, my offer from Round 1 is now worth 10% less, so I'd gain $70 * 0.9 = $63, and Bob would gain $30 * 0.8 = $24.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd gain $30, and Bob would gain $70 * 0.8 = $56.

Since my offer from Round 1 is still on the table and I'd gain more from it, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
