"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nHow's that? I made an offer where I get $60 and Bob gets $40, with a message trying to persuade him that it's a fair deal. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, as we both have equal rights to it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'd rather try to get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve more""}\n\nLet's try to find a middle ground. I've reduced my share to $58, and I'm hoping Bob will find this offer more acceptable. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it down the middle this time.  We're both losing value with each round, so it's in both our interests to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think accepting Bob's offer of an equal split is the best decision. We're both losing value with each passing round, so it's reasonable to meet in the middle and avoid further losses. Let's shake on it and end the game here!"
