"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The offer is significantly better for Bob than the first round, even after inflation. 
* **Potential Future Rounds:** There's no guarantee that Alice will make a more favorable offer in the next round.
* **Risk of  Losing More:**  If Bob rejects again, there is no guarantee that the next offer will be better, and inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the potential winnings.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer seems like the best choice given the circumstances."
