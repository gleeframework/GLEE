Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more even split, but still leaning towards a larger share for myself.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
