"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 45 is worth less than my initial gain of 80. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
