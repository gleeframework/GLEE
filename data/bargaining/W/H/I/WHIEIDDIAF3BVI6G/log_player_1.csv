"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share, recognizing that the money will be worth less to Bob in subsequent rounds.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my initial proposal. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially since the money is worth less to him with each round. I'll wait for my turn to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this round. Given the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my initial offer, I believe a 50/50 split is fair and a good compromise.  This ensures that we both get a reasonable share of the money before it depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal split. Although I'd prefer a 50/50 division, the inflation is starting to impact Bob's share significantly. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
