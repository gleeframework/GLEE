"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent cut. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to settle for such a small share, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round. I'll see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly this time. I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need a fair return for my time as well.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's not forget I'm the one making the offer now.  I'm offering a fair deal, and I think we should accept it before things get worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk losing more in future rounds."
