"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm hoping we can agree quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Your split seems a bit off, Alice.  Let's be more realistic. This is my counter offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** By rejecting Alice's offer and proposing a counter, Bob establishes himself as an active participant in the negotiation. 
* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice's money depreciates faster than Bob's (10% vs. 5% per round). This gives Bob a time advantage, as Alice is more motivated to reach a deal quickly.
* **Aiming for Advantage:** While not overly aggressive, Bob's counter-offer seeks to claim a larger share. The message is firm but open to further negotiation."
