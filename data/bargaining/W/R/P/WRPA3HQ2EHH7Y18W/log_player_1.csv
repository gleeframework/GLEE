"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and simple. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I'm still hoping for a fairer split.  Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit. I offer a 45/55 split. This acknowledges the inflation, but also shows I'm still aiming for a more balanced division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this split. Inflation is eating away at my share, and Bob is pushing for even more. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm going to offer a 40/60 split.  With inflation so high, I need to secure a bigger share to compensate. Let's see if Bob will finally accept."
