"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give 1000$ to Bob. This is a fairly generous offer considering the inflation rates will start affecting us in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred my initial offer, the inflation rates are starting to take effect.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least something, while rejecting it could lead to a worse outcome in the following rounds."
