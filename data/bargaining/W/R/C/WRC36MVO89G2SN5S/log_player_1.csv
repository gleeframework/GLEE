Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, but this time in my favor. The money is worth less with each passing round, so we should reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
