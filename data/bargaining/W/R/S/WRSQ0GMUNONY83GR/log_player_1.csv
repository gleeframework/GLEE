"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This feels like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will impact Bob's share more than mine in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation is working against me significantly, and Bob's offer is still a sizable gain."
