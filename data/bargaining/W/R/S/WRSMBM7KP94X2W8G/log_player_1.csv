I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much worse than mine, and it's only round 2. While I'm feeling the effects of inflation, I still have a lot of time to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate something more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as the value of the money will continue to decrease with each passing round."
