"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $1,000,000, which I hope will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, and Bob's offer is still 55% for me, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This offer gives me a 48% share of the remaining $1,000,000, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob this time around!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly!

Considering the new offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll receive:

* My share: 470,000 / (1 - 0.488) ≈ 870,000
* Bob's share: 530,000 / (1 - 0.1426) ≈ 620,000

This offer is actually quite close to the original 50/50 split, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
