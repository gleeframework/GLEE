"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. My message to Bob is: ""Accept and we can call it a day!"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm going to try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
