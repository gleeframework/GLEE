Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

This is a tough one, but it's time to cut my losses.  Alice seems determined to stick close to her original offer. If I reject this and she does the same with mine, the potential gains will shrink even further in the next round.  It's better to take a less-than-ideal split now than risk losing even more to inflation."
