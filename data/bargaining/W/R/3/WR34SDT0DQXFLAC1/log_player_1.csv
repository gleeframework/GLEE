"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer because it's not a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial proposal. Let's meet somewhere in between.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You're getting a better deal than you initially offered. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain has dropped significantly due to inflation!

Considering the offer, I think I'm getting a slightly better deal than my initial offer, but not as good as I'd like. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting a worse deal.

I'll accept this offer.
