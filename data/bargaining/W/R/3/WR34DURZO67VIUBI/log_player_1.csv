"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 dollars.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively fair split, considering the initial amount of 100 dollars. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 60 dollars, and you can have 40. We can both come out ahead if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to reject it. I'm not convinced that 40 dollars is the best I can get, especially considering the inflation rate. I'd like to see a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a better deal this time around. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take 45 dollars, and I'll get 55.""
}
```"
