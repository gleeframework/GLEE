"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the cash!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, $450,000 is still a decent amount. However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 5% less than his initial offer, which means he's actually getting $517,500 in real terms.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'm hoping to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that Bob's offer was a bit lower than I expected.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You said I couldn't do better, but I think I can! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'll give you a slightly better offer. Don't pass it up this time! 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting into Bob's offer this time! With the money I gain staying the same, $520,000 is a decent amount, but considering the 14.26% decrease in value, Bob's gain of $480,000 is actually worth only $413,120 in real terms.

I'm not getting desperate, but I'll consider this offer carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'm hoping to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best out of me yet! Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a more skewed split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice! But I'm not done yet. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's offer is getting less and less valuable. Considering the money I gain stays the same, $580,000 is a decent amount, but Bob's gain of $420,000 is actually worth only $343,600 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I should take this offer or try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'm hoping to squeeze out a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to push the limits.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You said I was getting closer, but I think I'm already there! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing the same split as my initial offer, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
