"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept this and we can both get something, or we can play it out and risk getting nothing.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start, and we can both get something without risking losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate, the money is worth less now, so I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said we should split it evenly, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Take it or leave it!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be more flexible, but a 55/45 split feels like a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. Let's reach a fair agreement before we lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at our potential earnings!

I'll think carefully about this offer. A 55-45 split is a bit more favorable to Bob, but considering the inflation, I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value.
