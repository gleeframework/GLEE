"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, fair and square. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'd rather not split it evenly, as Bob's share is worth 10% more than mine. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's share is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to take a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You got 10% less last round, I'm giving you a break this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but it's still more than you offered in the last round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's share is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the significant drop in Bob's share value, I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still a better deal for me than what I offered in the previous round.
