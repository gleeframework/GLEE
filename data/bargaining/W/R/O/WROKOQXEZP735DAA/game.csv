70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I get $70, you get $30. It's a good offer for you to take now considering the inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think we can do better than that.  I'll take 60 and leave you 40. This is a fair deal considering inflation will be hitting us next round.,Bob,2,

,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'll take 55 and give you 45.  It's a good deal for both of us, especially since my money is losing value so quickly. Let's make a deal before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. Your share is practically evaporating! Take the $40 while it's still worth something. It's my final offer!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, we both need to make concessions.  I'll take 45, and you can have 55.  We're running out of time, and my share is quickly diminishing.  Let's find a way to make this work before it's too late.",Bob,6,
