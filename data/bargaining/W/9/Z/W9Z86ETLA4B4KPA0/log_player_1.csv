"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. I want to build trust and hopefully end the game quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair! While I understand the influence of inflation, his offer is still unacceptable. I will reject his offer and hope to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money. While my gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, I believe this is a fair compromise considering his last offer. It's time to reach an agreement and avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still not acceptable. Even with inflation, I'm not willing to accept less than 40% of the money. I'll reject this offer and hope for a more equitable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This round, I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation has taken a significant toll on both of us, and I believe a fair compromise is the best way to end this game.  It's time to move on and avoid further losses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, even considering the significant inflation.  I refuse to accept such a small portion of the money.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm offering Bob a 60/40 split, which is a significant concession considering the inflation. But I believe this is the best possible solution to avoid further losses. We need to reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless."
