I'm going to start with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure that's a good starting point, and since I'm making the first offer, I'm going to try to get as much as I can!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's not ideal, but I'm happy to take a 50/50 split considering the inflation.  Better to get half now than risk losing more in future rounds."
