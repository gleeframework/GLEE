"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent chunk.  Accept and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd rather take my chances on getting a better deal in the next round, despite the 10% decrease in value. Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor for my taste. Let's see what I can propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer, considering the decrease in value for both of us. Since Alice's money is worth 5% less now, and mine is worth 10% less, I'll try to find a middle ground that might appeal to her.

{""bob_gain"": 420000, 
""alice_gain"": 580000, 
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can walk away without further loss.""}"
