"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to respond""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 2,000$ and keeping 8,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the effective gain for me:

My gain: 5,000
Inflation: 20% less than 8,000, so 6,400
Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll get 5,120 (6,400 * 0.8)

Bob's gain: 5,000, but it's worth 10% more than 4,500 (2,000 * 0.9), so it's actually worth 4,950

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
