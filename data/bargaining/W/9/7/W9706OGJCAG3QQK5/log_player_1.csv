I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if I can secure a good chunk of the money early on. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's a clear power play, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me so early in the game. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to see if I can find a middle ground. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
