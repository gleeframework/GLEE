I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'll take the bigger share this time, but we can still get a good amount each.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle-ish 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it. While I'd like more, Alice is starting to become more reasonable, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
