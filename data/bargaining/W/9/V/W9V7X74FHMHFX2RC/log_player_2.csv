"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little extra for me since the value decreases faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems ""fair"" on the surface, the value of my share decreases faster, so I'm better off trying to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly this round. It's in both of our best interests to avoid further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this. A little closer to even, but still accounting for the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer again.  The value of my share continues to decrease faster than Alice's, and I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's get closer to a 50/50 split this time.  We're both losing value with each round, and I'm starting to feel the sting of inflation.  Let's make a deal before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, how about we meet in the middle? This offer acknowledges the inflation while still giving us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though it's closer to a 50/50 split, my share is worth significantly less than it was in the first round due to inflation. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a deal that's more fair to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This inflation is hurting me more than you.  Let's split it a bit closer to 50/50, and at least we'll both get something.  It's better than getting nothing in the end!""}
