"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small amount, but leaves me with the majority. I want to see if he'll accept this offer in the first round, or if he'll try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, accepting this 50/50 split is the best course of action.  Inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing even more by rejecting and forcing another round."
