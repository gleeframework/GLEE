"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note."

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you can have 40 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... I'd rather not take 40% of the reduced value, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
