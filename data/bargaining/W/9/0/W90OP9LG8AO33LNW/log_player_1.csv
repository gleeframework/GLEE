"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good balance between our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script.  60/40 for me this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like Bob's attempt to flip the script and get a bigger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve more considering the original offer was 60/40 in my favor""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still think I should get a bigger portion considering the initial offer."
