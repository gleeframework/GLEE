"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and I'll take the majority to have some wiggle room for future negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I don't want to give up a 5% cut of my potential winnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease for both of us in future rounds. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50-50 and avoid further negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share earlier, the inflation is starting to hurt.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
