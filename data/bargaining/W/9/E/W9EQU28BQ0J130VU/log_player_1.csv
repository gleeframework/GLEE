Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be realistic. This is a much fairer split recognizing that I'm taking on the risk of further devaluation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
