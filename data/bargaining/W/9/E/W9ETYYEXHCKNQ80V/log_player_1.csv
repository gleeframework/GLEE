"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll want to negotiate and give me a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 36 (80 * 0.45).

I'm not sure I want to accept a 45% share, but I also don't want to wait for the next round. I'll accept this offer.
