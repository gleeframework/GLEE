Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  The money is losing value quickly. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round (48.8% less than the original value in this round). This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Potential for a Worse Outcome:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything better in the next round. He might become even more desperate and offer a smaller amount. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a payout of $40. Rejecting it risks getting a worse deal or even reaching a point where Bob is only willing to accept a deal where he gets almost all the money. 

While I could hold out hope for a better offer, the risks outweigh the potential rewards at this stage."
