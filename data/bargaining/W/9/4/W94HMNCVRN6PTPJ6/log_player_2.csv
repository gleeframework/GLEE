"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to make your own proposal next round. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $10, it's better to reject and see what Alice proposes next round. The money will be worth less for Bob, but he'll have the chance to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  The money is worth less with each round, so it's in our best interest to find a compromise.""}
