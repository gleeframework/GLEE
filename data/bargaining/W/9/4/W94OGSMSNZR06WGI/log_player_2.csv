"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since I know about the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for a deal before the inflation hits us too hard. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm worried about the inflation.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and I can't be sure Alice will be as generous in the future."
