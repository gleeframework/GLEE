"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small amount to get the ball rolling.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. The message is just a friendly opening offer to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money fairly, but I think it's time to move towards a more even distribution. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that.

In this round, my gain of $4,500 is still worth $4,500, but Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth $5,220 (5% less).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 50.5% - 49.5% split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial offer I made. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise."
