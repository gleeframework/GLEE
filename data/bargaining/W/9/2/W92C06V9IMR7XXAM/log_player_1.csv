"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is equal, so I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decreased purchasing power. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious and aim to get a larger share. However, Bob's offer is still higher than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going lower.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
