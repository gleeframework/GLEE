"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I get to make the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed 20$, I believe I can do better by waiting and making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to get back some of the ground I lost by offering a slightly more balanced split.  Since I get to make the offer, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even though the money is worth less to Bob, he's still trying to get a disproportionately large share. I'll keep holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, reducing my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept.  The money is worth less to him with each round, so I'm hoping he'll see this as a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though the money is worth significantly less to him now, he's still trying to get the majority. I'm determined to get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but this time by a larger amount. Bob is losing a significant amount of value with each passing round.  I think this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. It's frustrating that he's not budging much, but I'm holding out for a better split. The money is becoming less and less valuable to him, so I believe I have leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split. It's getting late in the game, and I believe a 50/50 split is fair considering how much the money is worth less to Bob. Let's see if he'll accept."
