"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to get the game going, and I'm taking the majority of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It accounts for your slight advantage with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, my gain is now worth 5% less than the initial $9000, which is $8550.

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation is only affecting me. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is still affecting me, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of my potential gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share. Let's see if this is more acceptable to you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself to account for the initial value of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer of a 60/40 split. It's fair considering inflation, and I'm not willing to give up more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect for the third time, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than the initial $9000, which is approximately $7713.60.

Considering the increasing difference in value between our potential gains, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair. I'd like to see a more significant compromise from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of my potential gain, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of my share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is taking a bigger toll on my share, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. Let's see if this is more acceptable to you.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which should be more palatable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of my potential gain."
