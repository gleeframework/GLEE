Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I propose to keep 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar. This way, I get the most while ensuring Bob has some incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. While the money is worth less to Bob, I still have 12 rounds and can likely get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm lowering my initial demand slightly to 90 dollars for me and 10 dollars for Bob.  I'm hoping this is a more enticing offer for him, considering the inflation factor."
