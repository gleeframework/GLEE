"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a division of $90 for Alice and $10 for Bob. This is a fairly generous offer considering Bob will get a 20% discount in the next round. It's in Bob's best interest to accept, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation rate is heavily impacting Bob's gains, making him more likely to accept a fair offer.  Since we both get an equal share, it's a good compromise."
