"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the value of the money will decrease for both of us in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I understand Bob's reasoning about the decreasing value of money. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to negotiate a better split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 48/52, considering the money's decreasing value""}

I'm offering a 48/52 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise."
