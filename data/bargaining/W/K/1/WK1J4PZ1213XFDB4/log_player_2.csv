Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My last offer was much fairer.  Take this deal before inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's clear you're not valuing the impact of inflation on your end.  Take this deal, or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear Alice is not going to budge.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something at all. Inflation is becoming a serious issue, and it's better to get a small share now than risk getting nothing later."
