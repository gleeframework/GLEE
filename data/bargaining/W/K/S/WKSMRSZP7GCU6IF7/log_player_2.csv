"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60% for me and 40% for you 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** By rejecting Alice's offer, I establish myself as a serious player and set the tone for future negotiations.
* **Understanding Inflation:**  Alice's money is devaluing faster than mine. This gives me leverage as the rounds progress.  
* **Strategic Offer:** My offer is still somewhat generous, recognizing the initial value of the money for Alice. However, it shifts the balance more in my favor.
* **Finality:**  The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure on Alice to accept now before her potential share diminishes further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I need a larger share. 80% for me, 20% for you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers reflect that.  While my potential gains are shrinking, accepting a mere 20% would be a significant loss compared to what I could potentially secure. I'm willing to gamble that Alice will become more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Let's end this before inflation hurts you further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift:** Alice's increasingly desperate offers suggest she's feeling the pressure of inflation.  I'm adjusting my strategy to appear more reasonable while still aiming for a larger share. 
* **Exploiting Fear:** My message highlights the negative impact of further inflation on Alice's potential gains, urging her to accept a less favorable deal now.
* **Finding a Balance:**  This offer aims for a balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring Alice is likely to accept. It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward is high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the severe impact of inflation, I need a much larger share to compensate for the loss in value. 95% for me, 5% for you. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I'm holding firm. Alice is clearly panicking, offering me a pittance. While 5% is a small amount, accepting sets a bad precedent and suggests I'm willing to cave under pressure. 

There's a real risk Alice will offer me even less in the next round, but there's also a chance she'll finally crack and offer a more equitable split.  My bargaining power comes from my willingness to walk away, even if it means no deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is the last chance to salvage any real value from your share. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm sensing Alice is nearing her breaking point. This offer is my final push, designed to be firm but not completely insulting.
* **Increased Share:** I've slightly increased my share again, capitalizing on Alice's increasingly desperate position. 
* **Ultimatum:** The message is direct and framed as an ultimatum. The phrase ""last chance"" aims to trigger a sense of urgency and prevent further rounds of fruitless negotiation.

**It's a gamble, but at this stage, the potential gains from a more generous offer are likely outweighed by the risk of Alice offering even less in future rounds.**"
