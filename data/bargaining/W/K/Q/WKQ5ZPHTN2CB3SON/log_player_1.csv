Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling generous, but let's make this worthwhile for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Let's be realistic and end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is framing this as his ""final offer,"" there's still room for negotiation. He's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. It's worth seeing if I can get him to come down a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. This split benefits us both. I get a slight edge, and you avoid further losses to inflation. Deal?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his last one, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Inflation:** I'm reminding Bob that every round that passes costs him real value.
* **Direct and Firm:** My tone is still confident and suggests this is a good offer he should take seriously."
