"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate later""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50, which is a reasonable offer. However, considering the inflation, $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll accept this offer, but I'll have to adjust my expectations for future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
