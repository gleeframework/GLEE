Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly this time.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 20% less to me, I'm willing to take the risk to try and negotiate a more favorable split. Bob's offer of $400,000 is too low, considering I initially offered him $400,000 in the first round. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try and get a better outcome. \n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Bob. \n\n###\n\n(Remember to respond in the same format)"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000, which is slightly more than my initial offer. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a more even split than my initial proposal. \n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob.
