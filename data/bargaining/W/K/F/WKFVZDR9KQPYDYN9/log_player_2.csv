"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, Alice's offer gives her a significantly larger share of the money. Considering the game has just begun and the impact of inflation on the money's value over subsequent rounds, it's reasonable to reject this offer in anticipation of either a better proposal in the next round or the opportunity to make a counteroffer that could result in a more favorable division for Bob. Rejecting also gives Bob the chance to assess Alice's willingness to negotiate and possibly to find a middle ground that is more equitable. Given the rules of the game and the potential for multiple rounds, an immediate acceptance of such a skewed division without attempting to negotiate would not be strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven that we are now in Round 2 and the value of the money decreases by 20% with each round, the effective value of the $1,000,000 is now $800,000. Considering this, I will make an offer that takes into account the decreased value but still aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer. We both lose if we keep going.""}"
