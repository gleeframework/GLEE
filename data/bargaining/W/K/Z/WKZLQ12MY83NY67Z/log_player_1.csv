"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50:50 split, but I don't want to risk getting a worse deal. Considering the inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
