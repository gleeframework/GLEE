"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I get 90% and you get 10%, but remember, with each round, the money loses value for me. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Let's see if we can get a better deal.  The money is losing value faster for Alice, so I'll propose something in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the inflation rate is higher for you. Let's end this game now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly now. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is better than my last offer, and the money is losing value faster for her. Let's end this."
