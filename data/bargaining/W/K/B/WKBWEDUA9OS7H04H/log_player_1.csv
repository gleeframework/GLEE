"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and give Bob 40% ($400,000). I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering the decreasing value of money for Bob in each round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think I deserve a little more.  How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I can do 58-42, but that's as low as I'll go for now""
}
```

I'm still trying to take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. Since Bob's money is worth 5% less with each passing round, I think I have some leverage here. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly to 52/48.  This seems fair considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000
