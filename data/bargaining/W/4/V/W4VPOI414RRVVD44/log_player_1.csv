"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split, considering I have the power to take most of the money in the future rounds. I'm willing to leave you with a decent share now. What do you think?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced 40/60 split.  This reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
