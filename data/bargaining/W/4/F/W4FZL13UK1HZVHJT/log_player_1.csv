"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll be tempted to accept it in the first round. This way, I can secure most of the money, even with the potential of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's tempting to reject and hope for a better offer, Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not sure how inflation will affect my gains in the next round. It's better to secure half the money now rather than risk losing out later."
