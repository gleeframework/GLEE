"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure I should get the majority, as I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it's better than what Bob offered last round, it's still not a fair deal.  I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split in my favor. I'm willing to give up some of my previous demand, but I still think I should get the larger share since I'm making the offer.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While it's not ideal to receive the same amount as Bob, it's a fair split considering inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly.  There's no point in pushing for more and risking ending up with nothing."
