"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair share for you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's my only chance to get some money, and it's still a decent share for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
