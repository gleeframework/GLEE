"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I'm aiming for a large share in the first round, knowing the value of the money will decrease for me with each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very unfair considering inflation, even though the money will decrease in value for me. I will reject this offer and hope for a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. While I still want a larger share, I'm recognizing that Bob might not accept such a lopsided deal again. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, I can't accept this offer.  I'm hoping for a more balanced split in the next round, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, but still aiming for a slight advantage.  I recognize that Bob is likely to reject offers with a large imbalance, and I need to be more realistic about the value of money due to inflation.  Hopefully, this offer will be acceptable."
