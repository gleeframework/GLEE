"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting 48 (60 - 12) if I were to accept this offer.

I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth 48 (60 - 12) in terms of the original value. I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly better deal than the 48 I would get if I accepted Bob's previous offer, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up some more, but I think 55 is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so my gain is now worth 31.2 (60 - 28.8). 

I'd be getting 45 in this offer, which is more than the 31.2 I'd get if I accepted this offer, so I'll accept it.
