"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. 7000 for me and 3000 for you. A fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can propose a better division. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I think a more balanced division is needed. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This way, we both get a decent share considering the money's decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. I'll take a small hit on my previous offer, 6500 for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, accepting this offer seems like the best option. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and further negotiations might lead to a worse outcome. Alice's slight concession from her previous offer makes this proposal more acceptable, especially under the pressure of inflation. It's time to finalize the deal before the value drops any further."
