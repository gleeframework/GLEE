# Bob gain: 450000

user: Congratulations! You have agreed to split the money with Bob. After 4 rounds, you get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. 
While you could have aimed for a larger share in the beginning, accepting this offer ensures that you both walk away with a significant sum before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 

Do you want to play again?"
