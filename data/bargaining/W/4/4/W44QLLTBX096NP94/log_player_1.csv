Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split, 55 for me and 45 for you.  This accounts for some inflation, but gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
