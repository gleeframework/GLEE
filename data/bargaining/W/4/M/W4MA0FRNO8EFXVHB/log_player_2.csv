"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's not terrible, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There are a lot of rounds left, and I'm not sure how Alice is affected by inflation, so there's a good chance I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice 40 dollars and keep 60 for myself.  This is a fair split, as it's closer to an even division than her offer.  I'm hoping she'll accept, as I'm not sure how inflation affects her, and I don't want to risk losing out on more money in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a little more, the inflation factor is starting to kick in.  Alice is getting a significantly worse deal due to inflation, and it's likely that her offers will continue to get worse in the coming rounds. I'm better off accepting a 50/50 split now and locking in a decent amount of money."
