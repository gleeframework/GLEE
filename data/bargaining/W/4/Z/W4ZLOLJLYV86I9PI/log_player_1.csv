I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob a small share.  This will hopefully make him more likely to accept and end the game quickly, before the inflation really starts to hurt!  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer to him.  While the inflation is a factor, I'm not ready to accept such a drastic change in the split so early on.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm decreasing my share by a smaller amount this time, hoping to show Bob I'm willing to compromise while still getting a fair deal. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm holding out for a better outcome."
