"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation. In the first round, I was offered $700,000, which is now worth 80% of its original value due to inflation. So, in the second round, I would be getting $560,000.

Bob's offer in the second round is $300,000, which is worth the same as in the first round. Considering the inflation, I would be getting $240,000.

I prefer Bob's offer, so I accept:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
