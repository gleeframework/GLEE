"Round 1

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering I'm not affected by inflation, I'm willing to make a small concession, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  We're both losing money if this drags on. Meet me in the middle?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to meet you in the middle. My share remains higher, but I'm willing to make small concessions. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a classic negotiation tactic, making small concessions while keeping her share significantly higher. However, her concessions aren't keeping pace with Bob's losses from inflation. It's time to push back more firmly, or the remaining rounds will see Bob forced to accept increasingly worse deals."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal.  The inflation means I'm losing significant value every round we delay. Accept this offer, or we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your sense of urgency, but I'm not willing to go down to 50/50. My offer is still slightly in my favor, but it's the best I'm willing to do. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While a 50/50 split was ideal, Alice is clearly entrenched in getting a larger share.  Continuing to hold out risks much worse offers in later rounds, with the threat of getting $0 looming. Accepting this offer cuts losses and ensures Bob gets something."
