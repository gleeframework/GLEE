"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too generous, huh?

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually worth 90% of the original amount, so he's proposing a 63% share for himself.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was trying to take a larger share in the last round, I'll try to counter that in this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, now it's your turn to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor this time, hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, but I'll compromise a bit! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still trying to get a better deal, I see!

Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering, taking into account the inflation:

* Bob's gain is 5500, which is worth 72.9% of the original amount (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%)
* So, Bob's actual gain is 5500 / 0.729 = 7551.01 (approximately)

Considering this, Bob's offer is a 55/45 split in his favor.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob is still trying to get a better deal, I'll try to push back even further. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting more, time to meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor this time, trying to get a bit more of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'll meet you halfway... this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a better deal.

Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering, taking into account the inflation:

* Bob's gain is 6000, which is worth 59.05% of the original amount (since 100% - 40.95% = 59.05%)
* So, Bob's actual gain is 6000 / 0.5905 = 10168.19 (approximately)

Considering this, Bob's offer is a 60/40 split in his favor, which is the same as my previous offer, but now it's actually worth more for Bob due to the inflation.

I'll think about it...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
