"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, then negotiate from there! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original amount, so I'll receive $76 for my share.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like we're meeting in the middle, and I'll take $50 and Bob will take $50. I'm glad we could agree on this!"
