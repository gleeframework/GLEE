Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money, while still giving Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept it. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, it's better to take what I can get now. If I reject this offer, the money I get in the next round might be even less due to inflation."
