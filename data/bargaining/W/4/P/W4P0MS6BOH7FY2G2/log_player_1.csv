"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle this time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fair compromise, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like we've reached a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could agree on a 50-50 split!"
