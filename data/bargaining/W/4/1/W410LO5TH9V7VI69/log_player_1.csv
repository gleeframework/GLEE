"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to keep 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar.  This is a classic strategy in game theory, as it gives me the maximum possible gain while still incentivizing Bob to accept the offer rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer. It's better than getting nothing in the end if I keep rejecting offers."
