Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I can get a better deal despite the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation. While she might think she's getting a better deal, the reality is her potential gains are shrinking each round. Bob's offers have been reasonable, and he should continue to stand firm.  Alice will likely propose a more realistic offer soon as she sees Bob is unwilling to accept a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the inflation is only hurting you.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  By now, Alice should realize that Bob is serious about getting a fair deal and understands the impact of inflation. Offering a 50/50 split is a strong power move:

* **Fairness:** It's objectively fair, removing any argument about who is getting a better deal.
* **Urgency:**  The ""final offer"" emphasizes that time is running out for Alice. 
* **Framing:** Highlighting that continued negotiation only hurts Alice reinforces Bob's position. 

This offer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. She can accept a fair deal or risk losing even more to inflation."
