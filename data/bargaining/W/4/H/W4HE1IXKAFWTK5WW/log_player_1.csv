"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think we can negotiate a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be careful about the value of the money I gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2. I'd rather not accept a smaller share than I initially proposed, especially since I don't know how much the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll propose a slightly smaller share for myself to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation is affecting my end more severely. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is decreasing in value rapidly. I need to be cautious about accepting an offer that might not be as valuable in the future.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4. I'm not convinced that he's taking into account the inflation effect on my end, and I'd rather wait for a better offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a slightly smaller share for myself to account for the increased inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2700,
  ""bob_gain"": 7300,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money, but I still think I deserve a fair share.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get concerned that we'll end up with nothing if we don't make a deal soon. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a big toll on the value of the money. I'm starting to get concerned that we'll indeed end up with nothing if we don't make a deal soon.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 6. While it's not ideal, I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.
