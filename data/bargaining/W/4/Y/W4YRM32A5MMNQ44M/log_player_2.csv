"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""How about we go 50/50 to make it fair for both of us?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, 58-42 is the best I can do for now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for inflation. How about 52-48?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll give a bit more, but 57-43 is my limit for now. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging inflation, the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting 4300 now is a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. It's worth risking a few more rounds to negotiate a better deal, even with the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the deadline.  I need you to consider the impact of inflation on my end.  I'm willing to accept a bit less than before, but 54-46 is my bottom line.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is hitting you hard, but I've already compromised. 56-44 is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Although Alice is offering slightly more, the effects of inflation are becoming severe.  It's getting to the point where accepting an unfair deal is still better than getting nothing in a few rounds. However, I'm hoping that proposing a more drastic split in the next round will push Alice to settle before time runs out."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now!  Inflation is eating up my share rapidly. This is my final offer - take it or leave it!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I won't budge much more. 55-45 is my final serious offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** We're now in round 9 with only 3 rounds remaining. The inflation means my potential gains are shrinking fast. While not ideal, accepting 4500 now is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree. Alice is unlikely to offer more, especially after calling her previous offer ""final."" It's time to cut my losses and secure a deal before it's too late."
