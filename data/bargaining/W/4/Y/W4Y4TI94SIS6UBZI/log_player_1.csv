"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $5,000 and Bob would receive $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small lead, but I'm still hoping for more later 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since I'm getting $4,000, that's worth 90% of the initial $4,500 I would have gotten in the first round due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can negotiate better in future rounds.
