"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
I'm hoping to get a bit more of the pie, given the decreased value of the money."
