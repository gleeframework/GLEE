"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more than Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation is affecting me more, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss of value. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now! Considering the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I think I should be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively close split, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get."
