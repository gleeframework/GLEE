Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50. No tricks, just a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000

Do you accept this offer?","{
