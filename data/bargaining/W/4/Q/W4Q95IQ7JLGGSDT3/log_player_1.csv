"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 0.95 * 5000 = 4750. I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which was 8000. After 3 rounds of inflation, it's worth 8000 * (0.95)^3 = 7231.25. So, Bob's offer would give me 4000, which is worth 4000 / 7231.25 â‰ˆ 0.554 of what I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
