"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a seemingly fair split, there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal for myself. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more equitable. After all, I'll be taking the risk of rejecting your offer in the next round. Let's see if you're willing to agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're taking a risk by rejecting my first offer, so I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time. Still, I think I deserve more for being the first to make a proposal. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject. Alice is trying to exploit the inflation by offering a slightly bigger share while still getting a bigger cut.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Let's get this done.  I'm offering you a slightly smaller share this time, reflecting the increasing value of my position as we progress through the rounds.  It's time to be realistic - we're both losing money with each round.  Agree to this, and we can both walk away with something.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a bit too aggressive with your offers, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to let you walk all over me. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject. Even though Alice is offering a larger share than in the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to receive, and I think I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. This is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the inflation and the risk we both are taking. Let's end this game and get something before it's too late!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not convinced that you're being generous enough, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up my negotiating power yet. 
# Bob gain: 6100 
# Alice gain: 3900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  While I'd like to push for a better deal, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Alice's offer is still better than what I would get if we keep rejecting each other, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal in the future. I'm going to accept."
