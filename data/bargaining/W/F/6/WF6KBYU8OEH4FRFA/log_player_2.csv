"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a ""fair"" split in terms of raw numbers,  Alice's offer is very advantageous to her. By the next round, the value of her money will only decrease by 10%, while mine will remain the same. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a good chunk of the money. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't accept my previous offer, so I'll try to be more aggressive this time. I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is getting more aggressive, but I'm still not satisfied with this offer.  I'm willing to take a smaller share than my previous offer, but 300,000 is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to get at least 400,000 to make this worthwhile. If you accept, we can both walk away with a good chunk of the money.""}
