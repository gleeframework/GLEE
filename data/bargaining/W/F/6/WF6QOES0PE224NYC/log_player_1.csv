"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take what I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer.
