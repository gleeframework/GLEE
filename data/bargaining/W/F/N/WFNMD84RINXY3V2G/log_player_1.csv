"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now considering a more aggressive offer from Bob.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking its toll, my offer needs to be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm now proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to balance out the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite close to the 50-50 split I proposed in the previous round. I'll consider this offer carefully.

I'll accept this offer.
