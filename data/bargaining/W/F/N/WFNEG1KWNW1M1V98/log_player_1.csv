"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (900,000) and gives Bob a smaller share (100,000). I hope this will be enough to incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially since I'm not losing any value due to inflation in this round. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit more, but still keep a substantial majority of the money. My offer is still significantly better for me than Bob's, and I hope it will be enough to incentivize him to accept before the inflation really starts to impact the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive approach this time.  While Bob's inflation is hitting harder now, I'm hoping he recognizes that it's in his best interest to accept a deal before the value of the money drops even further.  This offer still gives me the majority share, but offers him a decent amount given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 760000 
# Bob gain: 240000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still less favorable to me than my previous offer, despite the inflation. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I'll make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm sticking with a similar strategy, but increasing my share slightly to account for the escalating inflation. I'm hoping this offer is enough to convince Bob that he needs to accept before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 225000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still less favorable to me than my previous offer, despite the further decrease in the value of his share due to inflation. I'm determined to get a better deal and will make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going back to my original offer. The inflation is hitting Bob hard now, and I'm hoping he realizes it's in his best interest to accept something before it's too late. This offer still gives me a significant majority, but provides Bob with a better share than he's been offered in the past few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

# Alice gain: 825000 
# Bob gain: 175000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still less favorable to me than my previous offer, despite the significant inflation impacting his share.  It seems he's still trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to accept this offer. The inflation is working in my favor now, and I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to take a bolder approach.  I'm increasing my share significantly, recognizing that Bob's share has been drastically reduced by inflation.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, even with the small amount he'd receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 875000 
# Bob gain: 125000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the final round, and even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing. The inflation has severely reduced the value of the money for Bob, so I'm accepting this offer to avoid risking getting zero."
