I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping to secure a deal quickly. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  While I'm down 20% due to inflation, he's still getting the same value.  I'm going to reject this and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still hoping to get a good chunk of the money, but I'm willing to offer Bob a little more this time to hopefully get this deal done. Inflation is starting to hit hard, so I need to get something before it gets even worse!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being incredibly stubborn!  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still not willing to accept such an unfair deal. I'll try to counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm getting increasingly desperate with the inflation, but I'm still trying to hold onto a decent amount.  I'm offering Bob a bit more, but if he doesn't accept this, I'll have to be more realistic in the following rounds."
