"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  We both lose money if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be realistic - I'm willing to accept a smaller share to avoid losses later, but it needs to be reasonable.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is a bit closer to my initial proposal, but it still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, it's still advantageous for me to hold out a bit longer. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant for both of us, and Alice is feeling the pressure more acutely."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This offer gives you a slight edge, but it's the best you'll get at this stage. Let's settle this and avoid losing even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Pressure:** As we approach the halfway point, the impact of inflation is escalating. Both our potential gains are shrinking, putting pressure on Alice to make a deal.
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering Alice $5300, while slightly more than I proposed last round, is still a favorable outcome for me considering the shrinking pot. It signals a willingness to compromise but sets a firm boundary.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time constraint, urging Alice to make a rational decision before inflation erodes the value of the deal even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a lot of money. This is my final offer, let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:**  The value of the money has significantly decreased. Accepting $4400 now is better than risking a worse offer later and losing even more to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming very real. It's time to secure a reasonable gain while I still can."
