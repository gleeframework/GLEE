"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can both go home happy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my share is worth 20% less, but Bob's share is worth only 5% less. This means that the ratio of my share to Bob's share is becoming less favorable to me. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly higher share while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
