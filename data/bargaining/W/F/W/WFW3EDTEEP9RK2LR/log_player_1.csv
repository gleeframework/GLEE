Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in my favor.  I know Bob might not accept it, but I want to see if I can get him to agree early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, this is a much better deal than what I proposed. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money, and I'm not sure I can do better in subsequent rounds."
