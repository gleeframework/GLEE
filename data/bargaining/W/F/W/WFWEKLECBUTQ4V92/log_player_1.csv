"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! Accept my generous offer and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a 4:1 ratio. This should give me a good head start, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
