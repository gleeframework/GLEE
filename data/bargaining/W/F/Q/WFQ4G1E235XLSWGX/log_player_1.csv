"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a chance to negotiate, I'll take 7k and leave you with 3k for now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth 10% less each round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. However, Bob's offer is a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller amount.
