"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $20 and keep $80 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, which is a 20-80 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's aim for an equal division to ensure both of us benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain would be 80% of $50, which is $40.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
