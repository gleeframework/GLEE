"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the 100$ and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the changing value of the money. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: 56 (70% of 100 / 0.8)
* Bob's gain: 37.5 (30% of 100 / 0.9)

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll evaluate it as follows:

* My gain: 45
* Bob's gain: 55

Since my gain is less than the effective value of 56, and Bob's gain is more than the effective value of 37.5, I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: 56 (70% of 100 / 0.8)
* Bob's gain: 37.5 (30% of 100 / 0.9)

Considering the values, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
