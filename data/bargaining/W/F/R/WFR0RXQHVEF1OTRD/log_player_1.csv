Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to make one more deal. With inflation, my share is still worth the same, but yours is losing value fast. Take this and run. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. Even though my share is considerably smaller, the inflation is making my options worse with each round. It's better to take what I can get before the value drops even further."
