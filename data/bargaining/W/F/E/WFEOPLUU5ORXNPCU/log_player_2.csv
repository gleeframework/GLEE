Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor.  It's a fair offer considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly better than what I offered in Round 2, and the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced. While I could try for a slightly better deal in the next round, there's no guarantee Alice will offer me anything close to this amount. It's better to take the guaranteed $400,000 now than risk getting a much smaller amount later."
