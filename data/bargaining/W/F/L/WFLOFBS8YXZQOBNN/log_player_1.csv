"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 seems reasonable to me.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% of the original $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fair split, considering the inflation we'll face in the next round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 5% less than my original offer of $60, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth 20% less than his original offer of $60.

I think 55-45 is a fair split, considering the inflation we'll face in the next round.
