"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bit more. I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll counteroffer a slight adjustment:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""adjustment"": 250}

I'll accept the offer with the condition that I get $5000 and Bob gets $5000 + $250 = $5250."
