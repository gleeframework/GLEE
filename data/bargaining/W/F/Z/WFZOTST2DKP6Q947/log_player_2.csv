Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation we both face. Let's split it 80/20 this time, and I'll be ready to end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000
