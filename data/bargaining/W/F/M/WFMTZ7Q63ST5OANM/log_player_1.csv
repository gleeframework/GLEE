Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and maximize my share, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor. So, I'm offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, taking 1000 dollars is better than nothing. The inflation rate will make any future rounds much less favorable for me."
