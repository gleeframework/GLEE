Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $3000 / 0.8 = $3750
* Bob's gain: $7000 / 0.8 = $8750

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:
