# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is far too unfair, and it's only the first round. Let's see what Alice is willing to offer after I reject this proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still being greedy, and the money is losing value too quickly for me to accept this offer.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still offering a very unbalanced split.  I'm not sure if she understands how quickly the money is losing value, but I'm not going to give in to this kind of greed. I'll make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
