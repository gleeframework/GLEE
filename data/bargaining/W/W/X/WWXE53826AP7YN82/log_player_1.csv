Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each passing round, the money is losing value. We both need to be realistic about this. Let's split it 40/60. It's the fairest option at this point.

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Taking 600,000 now is significantly better than potentially getting a slightly better deal later when the overall value has shrunk.
* **Time Pressure:** We are running out of rounds. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both get nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees a win.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on the 40/60 split. It's unlikely he'll budge much in the remaining rounds, and waiting could backfire.
