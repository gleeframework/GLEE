"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money into two equal parts. This ensures fairness in our division. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While it's not a perfectly equal split, I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I bring to this negotiation. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and previous offers, I suggest an equal division of the funds. This maintains fairness and reflects the diminishing value of money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred my previous offer,  the inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential earnings.  An equal split is the most reasonable option at this point."
