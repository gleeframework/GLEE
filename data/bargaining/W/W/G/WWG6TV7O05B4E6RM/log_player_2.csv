{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's a very generous offer from your side, but I think we can find a division that benefits us both. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's still a great deal for you considering inflation will start eating into my share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bigger share, Bob, but this offer is fair given the inflation.  Let's meet in the middle - 80/20.  It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000
