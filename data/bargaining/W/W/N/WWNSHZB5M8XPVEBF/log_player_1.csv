"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 90% and Bob taking 10%. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him, as it leaves a decent amount for him while also giving me the majority. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial offer, the inflation is already biting into my potential gains.  Accepting this offer ensures I still get a sizable portion, and it avoids the risk of losing everything if we run out of rounds."
