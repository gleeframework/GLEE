"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, but I'm not giving away too much in case I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 50/50 split, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
