"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a bit more for myself, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle with a 55/45 split, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate again!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 55/45 split, especially since he's trying to increase his share after I offered him a 55/45 split in the previous round. I think I should try to hold my ground and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think 49/51 is a fairer split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a bit more for myself, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're being generous, but I'll take a slightly lower share this time to try to get closer to the 50/50 mark. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to accept a 51/49 split. It's a relatively even split, and I'm not willing to push for a more extreme split at this point. Let's finalize the deal!"
