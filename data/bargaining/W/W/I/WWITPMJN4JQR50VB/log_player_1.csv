"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and then we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my proposed gain of 500,000 in the first round is now equivalent to 400,000 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. He's offering me 300,000, which is 60% of the remaining 1,200,000 (1,000,000 - 800,000 due to inflation). That's a relatively low offer, but I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even lower offer in the next round.

I'll accept this offer for now.
