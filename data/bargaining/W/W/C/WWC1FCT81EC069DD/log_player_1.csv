"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and considering the inflation, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer share.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will take this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard!

Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I'll try to get as much as I can. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer again.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping this is a good decision, given the circumstances!"
