Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I think this is more fair, and we both lose money as time goes on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we're both losing money. This offer is still in your favor considering the inflation difference. Let's be sensible. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, trying to leverage the inflation against me.  While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate at which her potential gains are devalued.  I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're past the halfway point. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the clock is running out. This offer is a compromise, reflecting the time pressure and inflation.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough call, but time is becoming a serious factor. Alice's offer is now closer to the middle ground, and though it still favors her slightly, the impact of inflation is starting to really bite.  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting a much worse deal or even nothing at all in the later rounds."
