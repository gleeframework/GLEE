"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. The offer is not as favorable as mine was, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.
