"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 7000$ for me and 3000$ for you. This ensures a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal in the next round.  The inflation rate for me is much lower than Alice's, so I'm in a stronger position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more fair considering the decreasing value of the money for you. This way we both benefit from a faster agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in the value of money, I propose a division of 6400$ for me and 3600$ for you. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, Alice's offer is still better than the 4000$ I would receive in the next round considering the inflation rate. It's a reasonable compromise, and it avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
