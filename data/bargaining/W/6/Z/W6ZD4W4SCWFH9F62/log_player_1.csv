"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I'm not being generous, I'm just trying to get a decent share before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
