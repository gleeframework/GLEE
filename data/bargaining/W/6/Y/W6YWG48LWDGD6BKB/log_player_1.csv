Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your previous offer was unfair considering the inflation. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 2 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential gains are worth to him due to the 10% inflation. This makes him more likely to make concessions in later rounds.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in Round 3. He might propose an even smaller amount for Alice.
* **Fairness:** While the initial offer was slightly in my favor, accepting an even split avoids unnecessary conflict and ensures a reasonable outcome for both parties."
