"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer, but also takes into account the inflation risk. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to secure as much of the money as possible while still incentivizing Bob to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation means I'm getting less than I initially offered,  accepting this offer is still better than risking further rounds of negotiation and potential further devaluation of my share."
