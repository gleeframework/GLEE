"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. Let's see if we can do better than 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation yet. However, I need to think carefully about whether I should accept a 50-50 split, which is slightly worse for me than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive stance this time. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a bit more favorable to me than the initial 60-40 split I proposed in round 1.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55% is a fairer split. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your 55% proposal, but I think I can do better than that. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping to get the better end of the deal. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more for himself. Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about inflation yet. However, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I initially proposed.

Considering the 55-45 split I proposed in round 3, Bob's new offer of 52.5-47.5 is actually closer to my initial offer than his previous one. I'm not sure if I want to give up even more.

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with something better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 52.5-47.5 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to take an even more aggressive stance this time. I'll offer a 60-40 split, which is the same as my initial offer in round 1, but with a stronger message.

```

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to accept 60% either. I think I can get a better deal than that. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting the best deal. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze out even more for himself. Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation on Bob's offer. The 22.62% reduction in value of the money Bob gains means that the 48% share he's offering is actually worth less than it was in the previous round.

I'll reject this offer and try to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round.
