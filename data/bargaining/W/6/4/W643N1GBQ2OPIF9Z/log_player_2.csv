"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering inflation!""}\n\nPlease let me know how Alice responds.\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the offer. The inflation is taking its toll, and I don't want to risk losing more value. 250,000 is better than potentially getting less in the next round.\n\n###"
