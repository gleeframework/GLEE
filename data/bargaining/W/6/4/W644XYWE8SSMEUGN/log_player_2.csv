"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $400,000, I know that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases significantly. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's try this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like more, this is a decent offer considering the inflation factor.  I'll take the $450,000 and call it a day."
