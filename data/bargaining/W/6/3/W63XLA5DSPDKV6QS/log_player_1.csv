"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gets $40 (worth 90% of $44.44)
* Bob gets $60 (worth 90% of $66.67)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to...

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer.
