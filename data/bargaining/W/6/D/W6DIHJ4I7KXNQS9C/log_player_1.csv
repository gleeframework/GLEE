"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 40% is a good deal for me. I'd like to try to get a better offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bigger share this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but still a fair deal for you!""}

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 45% and I'll take the rest. It's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable, and I'm getting a bit desperate! While 45% is still a decent share, I'm not sure if it's enough considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll think carefully and decide...
