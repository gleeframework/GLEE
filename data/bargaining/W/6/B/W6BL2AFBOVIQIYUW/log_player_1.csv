Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategically sound option for Alice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the game continues, the less valuable the potential winnings become for Bob due to the 20% depreciation per round.  While this doesn't directly impact Alice, it influences Bob's decision-making.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting he's unlikely to move much further in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks Bob proposing an even less favorable split in a future round, where the pressure might lead Alice to accept a worse deal than she has now.

Accepting the 600,000 in Round 4 guarantees a decent payout for Alice, even if it means Bob gets a slightly better end of the deal due to the depreciation working in his favor."
