"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
