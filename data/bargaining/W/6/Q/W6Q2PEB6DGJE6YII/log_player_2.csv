Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your compromise, but 55/45 is still too far off.  Let's split the difference - 57.5/42.5. This keeps the majority share with me while showing I'm willing to meet halfway.

# Alice gain: 5750
