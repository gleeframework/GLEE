"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to counter! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering the money is worth 10% less for me now. I was hoping for a better split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly bigger share. Let's try 45/55!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial proposal and Bob's counteroffer. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a better deal, but I still want to keep a decent share."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The money is worth even less for me now, and I'm being offered an even smaller share. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a better deal, but I still want to keep a decent share."
