"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is more attractive than my initial offer, but still not as generous as I'd like. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In the next round, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 0% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money Bob gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his offer is actually quite generous considering the current value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.
