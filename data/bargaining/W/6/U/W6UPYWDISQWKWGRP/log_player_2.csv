Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value, 56% for me, 44% for you is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the inflation eats into her potential gains.  While her offer is moving in the right direction, I'm still in a strong position to push for a better deal.  We're close to the halfway point, and the pressure is mounting on Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is plummeting.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. Take it before we both end up with nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to play hardball. A 50/50 split is the most reasonable offer considering the circumstances.  Alice is running out of time, and the diminishing value puts pressure on her to accept a fair deal.  This offer sends a clear message that I'm serious about not settling for less."
