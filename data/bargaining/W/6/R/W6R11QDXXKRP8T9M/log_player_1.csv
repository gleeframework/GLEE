I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly and avoid any inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Even though I get a smaller share now, the money is worth the same as in the first round. I'm willing to wait another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference with my last round offer.  I'm still prioritizing getting a large share of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid another round of potential inflation."
