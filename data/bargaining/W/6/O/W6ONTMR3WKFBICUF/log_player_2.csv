Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. I understand you want a larger share, but the money is losing value rapidly for me with each round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
