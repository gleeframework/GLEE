"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it might seem like a decent chunk of money, waiting even a few rounds will give me a much better negotiating position due to the faster rate at which the money devalues for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split considering the devaluation. Let's not waste rounds.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. This counter-offer immediately flips the power dynamic and puts the pressure on her.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Highlighting the devaluation factor (""Let's not waste rounds"") reminds Alice that every round makes the pot less appealing for her. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** While this offer favors Bob, it's not unreasonable to the point where Alice would automatically dismiss it. There's room for her to accept or propose a counter that's still better for Bob than the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Favors Alice:** While Alice is suggesting a ""middle ground,"" her offer is still heavily weighted in her favor. 
* **Devaluation Working:** The decreasing value of the money is working in my favor. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, hence the more reasonable offer compared to round 1. 
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:**  I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a deal closer to a 50/50 split (or even better)."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is literally money Alice, and it's disappearing faster for you. This is a fair deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the Balance:** This offer is designed to be aggressive while still being within the realm of acceptability. It leans slightly in Bob's favor, reflecting the increasing pressure on Alice due to the faster devaluation.
* **Direct Communication:** The message directly addresses the time sensitivity and frames the offer as fair, appealing to Alice's rational side.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is aggressive, it's not an ultimatum. Alice could counter with a slightly higher amount for herself, and Bob might still accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Improvement, Not Enough:** Alice's offer has inched closer to the middle ground, but it's still not a significant enough concession to warrant accepting. The difference between her offer and my last one is minimal in the grand scheme, especially considering the ongoing devaluation.
* **Pressure is Mounting:** Alice stating this is her bottom line indicates she's feeling the heat from the devaluation.  My patience is starting to pay off.
* **Calculated Risk:** While we're past the halfway point, I'm willing to risk another rejection. The potential to secure an even better deal in the next few rounds is worth the gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is as close to even as we're going to get with the time left.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer is a strong stance that reflects the urgency of the situation.  It's close to a 50/50 split, acknowledging Alice's previous offer while still securing a slight advantage for Bob.
* **Direct and Time-Bound:** The message conveys a sense of urgency and finality. It suggests this is Bob's best offer and that further negotiation might not be fruitful given the rapid devaluation. 
* **Calculated Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Alice might reject this, the potential loss from further devaluation outweighs the possibility of getting a slightly better deal in later rounds.  It's time to push for a close."
