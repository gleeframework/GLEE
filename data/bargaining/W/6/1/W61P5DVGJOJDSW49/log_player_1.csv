"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation penalty he'll incur if he rejects it. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\n###  \n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in a more equitable split, especially considering the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation penalty he's facing, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I don't have an incentive to rush into an agreement. Additionally, Bob's argument about a more equitable split doesn't take into account the fact that he's the one who's primarily affected by inflation, not me.\n\n###  \n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering your loss to inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob compared to the first round, but still not as high as his offer in the second round. The message ""Considering your loss to inflation"" acknowledges the fact that Bob is facing a penalty for each round that passes, which should give him an incentive to accept the offer sooner rather than later.\n\n###  \n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's crucial to reach an agreement now before inflation further erodes the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his claim that it's his final offer, I believe he's under more pressure to reach an agreement than I am. The fact that the money is worth 48.8% less to him than in the first round means that he's losing a significant amount of value with each passing round. Given that I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to wait and see if Bob will make an even more generous offer in the next round.\n\n###  \n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that's slightly more generous than my first offer, but still favorable to me. The message ""Last chance before it's too late"" is an attempt to create a sense of urgency and make Bob believe that this is the best offer he'll get. Given the significant loss in value that Bob has already incurred due to inflation, I'm hoping that he'll be willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds.\n\n###  \n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###"
