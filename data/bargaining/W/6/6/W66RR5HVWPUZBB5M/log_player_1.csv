{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing that I get 8000 and Bob gets 2000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight advantage for myself."

I'm proposing a split of 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob. I'm trying to make it more appealing by giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a lead for myself."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more games""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him think that it's a good idea to end the game and split the money evenly."
