"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see if Bob agrees!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation effect on my gain. However, I notice that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, which means he's being more cautious.

Considering Bob's message, ""Let's meet in the middle!"", I think he's trying to find a compromise. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate further if needed.
