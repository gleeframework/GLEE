"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and leaves room for negotiation later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer is the best option considering the inflation.  It's a good gain for me despite the loss in value."
