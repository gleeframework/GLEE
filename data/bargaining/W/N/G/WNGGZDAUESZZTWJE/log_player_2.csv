"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose a 60/40 split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n### I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With a 5% decrease in value for me and a 20% decrease for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n### {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  Inflation is biting us both, so a 50/50 split seems fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Although a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next round. The money is worth less to both of us, but significantly less to Alice, which might motivate her to accept a slightly less favorable split in the next round to avoid further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on your end, I think a 58/42 split is a reasonable compromise.""}"
