"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up a bit, but I think a 55/45 split is fair considering inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is still trying to get the larger share, and the inflation is affecting her gains more than mine. I'll wait for the next round to see if she's willing to compromise further. Since the money is worth 19% less for her now, she may be more eager to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your gains, I believe a 65/35 split is a more suitable compromise. The longer we wait, the less your share will be worth.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: While I don't like this, I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's settle on 45/55. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer because Alice has finally offered me the larger share, and considering the significant impact of inflation on her gains, it's unlikely she'll be willing to give up much more. This seems like a reasonable compromise, given the circumstances."
