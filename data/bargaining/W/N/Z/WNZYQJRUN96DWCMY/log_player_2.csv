"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the current offer, I'd be left with $30, but I think I can negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I need to be strategic about when to accept an offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, while still considering the decreasing value of money for me in each round. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This offer is more balanced.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will consider this offer and we can come to an agreement. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the balance of the proposed division. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer. Considering the decreasing value of money for me, 35 dollars in round 3 is equivalent to about 22.4 dollars in round 1. However, if I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing if we can't agree on a division within the remaining rounds. Alice claims this is her final offer, but I'm not sure I believe her. Given the circumstances, I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next! I'm hoping Alice will be willing to make another offer or accept a counteroffer from me in the next round. The pressure is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I've rejected Alice's ""final"" offer, I need to make a counteroffer that's attractive to her while considering the decreasing value of money for me. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 42,
""alice_gain"": 58,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's settle this!""}\n\n###\n\nI've reduced my proposed gain from the previous round, hoping to meet Alice halfway. The message conveys my willingness to compromise and settle the game. Fingers crossed that Alice will accept this offer or make a counteroffer that's reasonable!"
