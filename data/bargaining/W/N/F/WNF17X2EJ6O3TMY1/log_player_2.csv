Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 45/55, that's a fairer deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her more than me. It's time to push for a more significant advantage on my end, knowing she'll be increasingly desperate as time runs out."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money, and it's disappearing fast.  My offer is generous considering the circumstances. Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable. We're both losing money with every round. A 40/60 split seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving significantly towards a more even split. Given the inflation rate, waiting any longer to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal is getting too risky. Accepting a 60/40 split at this point guarantees a reasonable win and avoids the disastrous outcome of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
