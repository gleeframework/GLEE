"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly, Alice.  I understand the inflation concern, so I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
