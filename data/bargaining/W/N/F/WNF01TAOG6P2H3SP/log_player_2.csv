""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly, Alice.  I understand the inflation concern, so I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This gives us both a decent share.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is now $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is my final offer. If you refuse, the money will be worth even less for me in the next round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal then.

# Alice gain: 5800
