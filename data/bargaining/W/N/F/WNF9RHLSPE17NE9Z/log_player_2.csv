Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're in the endgame now. Let's be reasonable. A 70/30 split is a fair compromise considering the time pressure.  Accept this, or we risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

This is a tough one, but the clock is really working against me now.  Alice is clearly playing tough, and while I'd prefer a better split, 300,000 is still a significant sum. Accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing if I keep pushing my luck."
