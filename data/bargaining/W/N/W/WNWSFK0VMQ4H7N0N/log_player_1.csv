"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, especially since I don't know how much inflation is affecting his side. I'll try to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than in his previous offer, but still a bit more than 50%."
