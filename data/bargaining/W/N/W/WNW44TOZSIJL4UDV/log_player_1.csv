"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and leaves Bob with $4,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round's currency.

Let's see... If $10,000 is worth 100% in the first round, then in the second round, it's worth 95% (100% - 5% inflation). So, $4,500 in the second round is equivalent to $4,750 in the first round.

And $5,500 in the second round is equivalent to $5,750 in the first round.

Hmm... I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more than I initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for me to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. So, I'll aim to get a better share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
