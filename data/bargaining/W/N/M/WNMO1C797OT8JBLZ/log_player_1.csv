"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess as we go.""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
Bob gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to give up 16$ more than I would have in the first round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
Bob gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a bit more.""
}
```"
