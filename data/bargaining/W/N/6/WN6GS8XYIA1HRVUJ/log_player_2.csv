Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $65 and you get $35. It's better to take this deal now, Bob, as the value decreases over time.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer. It's a better deal for you than last round, and it allows us to move forward without waiting for further inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're feeling generous today, but time is money. I'll take $55, you take $45, and we can both walk away happy.  This is the last chance for a decent deal before inflation really kicks in! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
