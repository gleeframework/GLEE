Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. It's a better deal for you than last round, and it allows us to move forward without waiting for further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
