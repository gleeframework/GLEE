Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 560000

Even though the offer is not ideal, the inflation is hitting Alice much harder than me. It's better to secure a deal now, rather than risk further losses."
