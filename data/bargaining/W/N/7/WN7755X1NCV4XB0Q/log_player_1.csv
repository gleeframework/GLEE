"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both get a good amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll get 50$ and Bob will get 50$. However, due to inflation, the actual value of the money I'll get is 40$ (80% of 50$).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll decide to reject it for now. I'll make a new offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a higher share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to prioritize my own gain""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the remaining 100$, which is equivalent to 48$ in actual value (80% of 60$)."
