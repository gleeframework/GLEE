"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a significant share. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept early on and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential gains.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less than what I proposed in the first round, and the inflation is already eating away at my potential gains.  I'm not going to accept this deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer slightly, increasing my share while still giving Bob a respectable amount.  I need to be more assertive to counter the inflation, but I still want to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse and worse!  I'm not willing to accept this.  I need to be more assertive in the next round and try to secure a better deal before inflation eats away any more of my potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my share again, trying to find a balance between securing a good amount and avoiding a complete stalemate.  The inflation is a major factor now, so I need to be more aggressive.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still very unfavorable, and the inflation is getting out of control.  I need to make a strong offer in the next round and try to get a better deal before it's too late.  I'm not going to accept this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is making things very difficult, but I need to push for a better deal. I'm increasing my share again, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob.  It's a risky move, but I need to try to secure a win before inflation eats away all of my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is now so high that any further rejections will significantly reduce the value of my potential earnings.  While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and the value of that something is still decreasing with every passing round.  It's time to take the sure thing."
