{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 400,000 and Bob getting 600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 75-25 split. I was hoping for a more even distribution. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob to make another proposal."
