Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's make it more balanced considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly, especially for you. I'm offering a slightly better deal than before, let's be realistic and close this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the deal is no longer ideal due to inflation, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better given his decreasing returns and the increasing pressure of time.  Continuing to reject offers in hopes of a more favorable outcome is risky and could lead to both of us losing out entirely."
