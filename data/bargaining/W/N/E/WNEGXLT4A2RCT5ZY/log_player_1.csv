"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar.  I want to maximize my gains in the first round, as inflation will decrease the value of the money later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take 5 dollars, I believe I can do better in the next round. I'll use my next offer to try and get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to lower my demands slightly and offer Bob 10 dollars. While I still want the majority of the money, I'm hoping this more reasonable offer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even with inflation, 20 dollars is not a good enough return for me.  I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to 80 dollars for me and 20 for Bob.  I think this is a fair offer that still allows me to get a good amount of money, but it's also a compromise that could get Bob to accept."
