"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. This allows us both to have a fair share while considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 3:7 is too skewed. I'm proposing a 4:6 split, which is still generous considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
