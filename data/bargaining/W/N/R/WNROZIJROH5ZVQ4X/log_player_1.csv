"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30. I'll get the majority, but you'll get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's inflation rules. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed fair and even. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
