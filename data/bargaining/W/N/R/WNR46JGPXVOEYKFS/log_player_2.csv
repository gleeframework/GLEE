"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. Bob should reject this offer, as he has the power to make a counter offer that will likely yield him a better result.  It's too early in the game to accept such a small portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a significantly better offer than the first round, the 19% inflation means Bob is still losing a lot of potential value.  It's worth holding out for a better deal, especially with only 10 rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4240 
# Alice gain: 5760 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should continue to reject offers. While this is a better offer than previous rounds, the inflation is hitting hard, and the deal is still significantly skewed in Alice's favor.  With 8 rounds remaining, Bob has leverage to negotiate a much more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is slightly more generous to Alice than Bob's previous offer, but it still reflects the reality of the declining value of money due to inflation. Since the inflation is hitting Alice harder, this offer might be tempting enough for her to accept.  It's a risky move, but it could be a good gamble with 7 rounds remaining."
