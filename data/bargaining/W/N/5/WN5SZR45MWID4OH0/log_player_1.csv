"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split. However, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I think I can live with this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
