"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a fair deal, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fairer, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 36 dollars.

I don't think this offer is fair, since it's the same as my initial offer, but with less value due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars would be worth 45 dollars, which is a more reasonable amount considering the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45-55 is a fairer split.""
}
```"
