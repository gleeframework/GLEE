"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money with a 70/30 ratio. This might not seem fair, but consider the risk of losing value with each round due to inflation.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. I believe this is a fairer split considering the risk of inflation and the fact that we both have an equal chance of making a proposal in the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
