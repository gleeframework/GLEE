I'm going to start by being very greedy and taking nearly all the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's clear we're in a stalemate, and we'll need to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope Bob will see it that way."
