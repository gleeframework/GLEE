I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round, hoping to secure a large portion of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my first offer, even accounting for inflation. I'm still in a good position to get a better deal, so I'm going to reject and see if I can get a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, but still aiming to get a larger portion of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a better deal than his previous offer, especially with the continued inflation."
