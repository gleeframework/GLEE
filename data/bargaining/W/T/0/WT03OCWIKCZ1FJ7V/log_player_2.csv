"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll try to make a better one. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, Alice's offer is actually worth less than it seems. My gain of 3000 is worth 81% of the original 1000, which is 810. My gain in the first round was worth 810, but now it's worth 19% less, which is 653.20.

Alice's gain of 7000 is worth 92.5% of the original 9000, which is 8280.

Considering this, Alice's offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer. I'll accept it.
