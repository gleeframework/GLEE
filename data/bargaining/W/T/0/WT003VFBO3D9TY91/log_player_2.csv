Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it 55-45, I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but 55 for me and 45 for you is the best I can do right now.  Let's get this done before the value of the money drops too much. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think Alice is still being a bit too greedy, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try to get a better deal. The inflation isn't too bad yet, so I'll try to push my luck!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Consider the impact of inflation on both players.
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for me (Bob) and 10% less for Alice, it's crucial to factor this into my proposal. As of Round 4, the money I gain is worth 14.25% less than in the first round (5% decrease compounded over 3 rounds), and for Alice, it's worth 27.1% less (10% decrease compounded over 3 rounds).

### Step 2: Evaluate the previous offers and the current situation.
Alice's last offer was 55 for her and 45 for me. Given the decreasing value of money, it's essential to consider not just the nominal value but the actual value after accounting for inflation. My goal is to maximize my gain while considering Alice's decreasing valuation to make an offer she might accept.

### Step 3: Formulate a new offer considering the current dynamics.
Given the urgency due to inflation and the fact that Alice is also losing value, I should aim for a slightly more favorable offer than before but still be mindful of Alice's perspective to avoid rejection. Aiming for a compromise that slightly adjusts from the last offer could be a strategic move.

### Step 4: Craft a persuasive message to accompany the offer.
The message should convey a sense of urgency due to inflation, emphasize the compromise, and hint at the mutual benefit of accepting the offer now rather than risking further devaluation.

### Step 5: Decide on the specific numbers and message.
Considering the steps above, I'll propose a division that slightly adjusts from the last offer, considering the compounded decrease in value for both of us. Aiming for a 52-48 split could be seen as a compromise, given the circumstances.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the significant drop in value for both of us, let's meet closer to the middle before it's too late. This 52-48 split accounts for our shared loss and the risk of walking away with less if we don't act now.""}"
