"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we're both losing money as time passes. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be fairer to each other. This offer accounts for the fact that we both lose with time, but your loss is less than mine.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out the longer this takes.  My offer is still on the table - it's a good deal that recognizes your losses are greater than mine as time passes. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting a deal where Alice gets significantly more isn't ideal. It's a risk to push it further, but there's still a chance to negotiate a more balanced outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We both lose if this drags on.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Pushing for a slightly better deal than Alice's offer is risky now. A 50/50 split emphasizes fairness and puts the pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, it highlights her unwillingness to compromise."
