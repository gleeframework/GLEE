Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me.  I'm willing to give you 30 dollars if I get 70. This is your last chance for a decent offer, Alice, as the money will be worth less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
