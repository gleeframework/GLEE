"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure you're under. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. This initial offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe we can negotiate a better split. Let's proceed to the next round where I can propose an alternative division."

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a generous offer considering the time pressure is mounting on you. Let's settle this fairly and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer has improved slightly, I still believe it doesn't adequately account for the value I bring to the table. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping to offset the loss in value over time. Let's proceed.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for you. This is a fair offer, and I urge you to consider it carefully before time erodes your potential gain further. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer has improved, the impact of inflation is significant, and I'm not ready to settle for this amount yet. I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round, hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise as the game progresses. The difference in the value of money between us is substantial, and I aim to minimize my loss.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation, I'm going to propose a 50/50 split as a final attempt to reach a fair agreement. This split acknowledges the pressure I'm under and seeks a compromise that reflects the initial value of the money before the devaluation began. I hope we can conclude with this offer.""}"
