Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but let's make it a bit more even. This offer considers the time-value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's wrap this up!""
}
``` 
 
Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Time Pressure:** Delaying is worse for me than Bob due to the higher inflation rate. I need to push for a resolution sooner rather than later.
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my initial demand slightly to make it appear like a compromise, even though it's still in my favor considering the inflation difference.
* **Ultimatum:**  Framing it as my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and might pressure Bob to accept. 

Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
