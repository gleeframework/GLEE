"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should switch it up this time. Your turn next if this doesn't work for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 10% less, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to $405,000 in the first round. Similarly, the money Bob gains is now worth 5% less, so his share of $550,000 is equivalent to $522,500 in the first round.

Considering these adjusted values, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I'll try to make up for the loss by increasing my share. At the same time, I'll make sure to leave enough for Bob to consider the offer acceptable.

My new offer will be $580,000 for myself and $420,000 for Bob. I'll also include a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a good compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like a fair split considering the inflation.  We should settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nWith the money I gain now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of $480,000 is actually equivalent to approximately $350,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less, making his share of $520,000 equivalent to around $446,000 in the first round.

Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer at this point. The difference in our shares is not as significant as it was in the first round, and further rounds will only continue to devalue the money.
