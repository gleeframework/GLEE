"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  We'll see how he responds.  Let's see if he takes the deal or wants to play it out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is clearly unfair.  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in so easily.  I'll counter his offer in the next round.  Let's see if we can find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm taking into account the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we need to find a compromise to get anything at all.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to exploit the inflation by offering me a significantly lower amount than what I would have gained in the first round. I won't be a victim of his strategy. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to find a fairer split before the money becomes worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm still offering a larger share to myself, but this time, I'm lowering my demand slightly to account for the increasing inflation. I'm hoping that Bob sees that we need to reach a compromise soon or we'll both lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair, and the inflation is eating away at the value of the money even faster now. I refuse to be taken advantage of. I'll counter with another offer in the next round, but I'm starting to think this might end with both of us getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm starting to get desperate. The value of the money is dwindling rapidly, and Bob seems unwilling to compromise. I'm lowering my offer again, but I still need to secure a decent share for myself. This is a risky move, as Bob could easily reject it and push us closer to the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, and the inflation is pushing us dangerously close to the end of the game.  I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to find a more balanced solution before we both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 590490, ""bob_gain"": 409510}
```

The pressure is mounting, and we're rapidly approaching the end. This is my final attempt to secure a reasonable share.  I've reduced my demand significantly, hoping Bob will recognize the urgency and compromise.  If this fails, we're both heading towards a disastrous outcome."
