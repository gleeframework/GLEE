"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. My share of $2,000 is now worth significantly less than my initial offer of $6,000. I'll have to think carefully before accepting.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself, trying to balance the reduced value of the money."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the rapid inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I should push for more.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...

After considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
