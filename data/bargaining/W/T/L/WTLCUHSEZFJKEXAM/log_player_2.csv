Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share this time.  It's fair, and we can end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share this time.  It's a fair compromise, and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, getting 40 is better than nothing.  Let's end this game."
