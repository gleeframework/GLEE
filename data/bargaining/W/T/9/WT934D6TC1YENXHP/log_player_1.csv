Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, considering the inflation. It gives us both a decent amount while still accounting for the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
