Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the slight increase in my gain from Round 1, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
