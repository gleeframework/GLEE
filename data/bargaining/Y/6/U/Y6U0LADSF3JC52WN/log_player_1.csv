"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. This offer won't be as good for me later.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:**  Alice starts with a favorable offer (900,000 for herself, 100,000 for Bob). This aims to capitalize on the fact that the money is worth more to Bob now than it will be in later rounds due to his 5% inflation rate.
* **Time Pressure:** The message subtly emphasizes the time pressure by hinting that the offer won't be as good for Alice in later rounds. This encourages Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in the long run. Accepting now means missing out on potential gains as Bob's share becomes increasingly less valuable to him. 
* **Leveraging Time:** Alice needs to make Bob sweat a bit.  By rejecting this offer, she signals that she's willing to play the game and that Bob's ""fairness"" argument isn't swaying her.  

**Strategy:**

Alice should aim to propose an offer in the next round that still gives her a larger share but is tempting enough for Bob to consider seriously given the looming inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us, especially considering how things are going.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand from 900,000 to 800,000, making the offer appear more appealing to Bob.
* **Highlighting Inflation:** The message directly mentions the time sensitivity, reminding Bob that his potential gains are shrinking with every passing round. 
* **Balancing Act:**  This offer still heavily favors Alice but provides a substantial enough increase for Bob (compared to his previous 100,000 offer) to make him seriously consider the deal."
