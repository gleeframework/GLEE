Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the halfway point. This offer is still a compromise, but I need to be mindful of the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4650 
# Alice gain: 5350 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is designed to put pressure on Bob. However, Alice is becoming more aware of the time pressure as well. It's important for Bob to hold his ground a bit longer to see if Alice is willing to make a more significant move towards a truly even split, given the increasing disadvantage Bob faces with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. Halfway point, and the pressure is on both of us.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are at a critical juncture.  Delaying further significantly hurts Bob due to the inflation mechanic.
* **Strong Stance:** This offer, while potentially risky, demonstrates that Bob is serious about a fair deal and won't be pressured into unfavorable terms.
* **Clarity:**  The message is clear and to the point, emphasizing the urgency of the situation for both players.

If Alice rejects this offer, it's a strong signal that she's unlikely to agree to a truly fair split. Bob will need to significantly adjust his strategy in the remaining rounds to maximize his potential gains, even if it means accepting a less than ideal outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but the reality is the value has decreased significantly for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** Alice's tone has become more assertive. Her statement ""This is my final offer"" suggests she believes she has the upper hand and is unlikely to concede further.
* **Unfavorable Trend:** The offers from Alice have not been improving significantly for Bob. Continuing to reject them risks even worse offers in the later rounds, where the inflation penalty for Bob will be much harsher.
* **Limited Options:**  While accepting this offer means receiving a smaller portion, it's better than risking getting nothing at all if the game goes to the 12th round. 

This is a tough decision point, and there's no guarantee that accepting is the optimal move. However, given the information available and the potential downside of further rejections, taking this offer seems like the most logical course of action."
