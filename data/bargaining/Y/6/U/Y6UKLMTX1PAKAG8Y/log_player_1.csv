Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite fair, Alice.  However, since I'm taking the risk of the money devaluing further, I propose we switch amounts for this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
