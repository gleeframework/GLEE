"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you $30 and keeping $70 for myself. Will you accept or reject?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

Will you accept or reject my offer?"
