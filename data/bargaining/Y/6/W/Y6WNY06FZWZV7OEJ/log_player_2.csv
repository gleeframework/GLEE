Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the inflation heavily impacts her share. While her offer is closer to a fairer split, we're not out of time yet.  Holding out a little longer could pressure her into a more favorable offer for Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and frankly, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a 51/49 split.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:** The message aims to make Alice aware of the shrinking pie and her increasingly disadvantaged position.  
* **Slight concession:** Bob shows a willingness to negotiate by moving slightly closer to an even split, but still maintains a slight advantage. 
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing the limited time remaining increases the pressure on Alice to accept a deal before her potential gains dwindle further."
